However,\nimplementing Backpropagation (BP) on such hardware is challenging because\nforward and backward passes are typically performed by separate networks with\ndistinct weights. To compute correct gradients, forward and feedback weights\nmust remain symmetric during training, necessitating weight transport between\nthe two networks. This symmetry requirement imposes hardware overhead and\nincreases energy costs. To address this issue, we introduce Frozen\nBackpropagation (fBP), a BP-based training algorithm relaxing weight symmetry\nin settings with separate networks. fBP updates forward weights by computing\ngradients with periodically frozen feedback weights, reducing weight transports\nduring training and minimizing synchronization overhead.

Despite much progress in improving rendering\nquality and optimization strategies, 3DGS-based streamable dynamic scene\nreconstruction still suffers from flickering artifacts and storage\ninefficiency, and struggles to model the emerging objects. To tackle this, we\nintroduce MGStream which employs the motion-related 3D Gaussians (3DGs) to\nreconstruct the dynamic and the vanilla 3DGs for the static.

In this paper, we propose 4D-ROLLS, the first weakly supervised\noccupancy estimation method for 4D radar using the LiDAR point cloud as the\nsupervisory signal. Specifically, we introduce a method for generating\npseudo-LiDAR labels, including occupancy queries and LiDAR height maps, as\nmulti-stage supervision to train the 4D radar occupancy estimation model.

The computational complexity of the Transformer architecture increases\nquadratically with image resolution, while Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\narchitectures are forced to stack deeper convolutional layers to expand their\nreceptive fields, leading to an explosive growth in computational demands. To\naddress these computational constraints, we leverage Mamba's linear complexity\nfor efficiency.

To\naddress this, some methods use the well-learned knowledge of foundation models\n(e.g., SAM) to simplify the learning process. Recently, SAM 2 has extended SAM\nby supporting video segmentation, whose class-agnostic matching ability is\nuseful to FSS. A simple idea is to encode support foreground (FG) features as\nmemory, with which query FG features are matched and fused. Unfortunately, the\nFG objects in different frames of SAM 2's video data are always the same\nidentity, while those in FSS are different identities, i.e., the matching step\nis incompatible. Therefore, we design Pseudo Prompt Generator to encode pseudo\nquery memory, matching with query features in a compatible way. However, the\nmemories can never be as accurate as the real ones, i.e., they are likely to\ncontain incomplete query FG, and some unexpected query background (BG)\nfeatures, leading to wrong segmentation. Hence, we further design Iterative\nMemory Refinement to fuse more query FG features into the memory, and devise a\nSupport-Calibrated Memory Attention to suppress the unexpected query BG\nfeatures in memory.

However,\nconventional KD frameworks rely on pre-trained high-capacity teacher networks,\nwhich introduce significant challenges such as increased memory/storage\nrequirements, additional training costs, and ambiguity in selecting an\nappropriate teacher for a given student model. Although a teacher-free\ndistillation (self-distillation) has emerged as a promising alternative, many\nexisting approaches still rely on architectural modifications or complex\ntraining procedures, which limit their generality and efficiency.\n  To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework based on\nteacher-free distillation that operates using a single student network without\nany auxiliary components, architectural modifications, or additional learnable\nparameters. Our approach is built on a simple yet highly effective\naugmentation, called intra-class patch swap augmentation. This augmentation\nsimulates a teacher-student dynamic within a single model by generating pairs\nof intra-class samples with varying confidence levels, and then applying\ninstance-to-instance distillation to align their predictive distributions.

Current strategies typically\nprioritize sequential modeling for deep semantic understanding, overlooking the\ngraph structure in interactions.

In this paper, we propose Symbolic\nGraph Ranker (SGR), which aims to take advantage of both text-based and\ngraph-based approaches by leveraging the power of recent Large Language Models\n(LLMs). Concretely, we first introduce a set of symbolic grammar rules to\nconvert session graph into text.

While current DiT models can\nproduce high-definition, high-frame-rate, and highly diverse videos, there is a\nlack of fine-grained control over the video content. Controlling the motion of\nsubjects in videos using only prompts is challenging, especially when it comes\nto describing complex movements. Further, existing methods fail to control the\nmotion in image-to-video generation, as the subject in the reference image\noften differs from the subject in the reference video in terms of initial\nposition, size, and shape. To address this, we propose the Leveraging Motion\nPrior (LMP) framework for zero-shot video generation. Our framework harnesses\nthe powerful generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion transformers to\nenable motion in the generated videos to reference user-provided motion videos\nin both text-to-video and image-to-video generation. To this end, we first\nintroduce a foreground-background disentangle module to distinguish between\nmoving subjects and backgrounds in the reference video, preventing interference\nin the target video generation. A reweighted motion transfer module is designed\nto allow the target video to reference the motion from the reference video. To\navoid interference from the subject in the reference video, we propose an\nappearance separation module to suppress the appearance of the reference\nsubject in the target video.

However, extending these methods to\nreal-world scenarios that involve implicit and complex instructions,\nparticularly in conjunction with multiple images, poses significant challenges,\nwhich is mainly due to the lack of advanced reasoning ability across diverse\nmulti-modal contexts. In this work, we aim to address the more practical\nuniversal grounding task, and propose UniVG-R1, a reasoning guided multimodal\nlarge language model (MLLM) for universal visual grounding, which enhances\nreasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL) combined with\ncold-start data. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) grounding dataset, annotated with detailed reasoning\nchains, to guide the model towards correct reasoning paths via supervised\nfine-tuning.

This study examines\nhow five common forms of image degradation--contrast, brightness, motion blur,\npose shift, and resolution--affect FRT accuracy and fairness across demographic\ngroups. Using synthetic faces generated by StyleGAN3 and labeled with FairFace,\nwe simulate degraded images and evaluate performance using Deepface with\nArcFace loss in 1:n identification tasks.

These disparities raise concerns\nabout fairness and reliability when FRT is used in real-world investigative\ncontexts. Nevertheless, even under the most challenging conditions and for the\nmost affected subgroups, FRT accuracy remains substantially higher than that of\nmany traditional forensic methods. This suggests that, if appropriately\nvalidated and regulated, FRT should be considered a valuable investigative\ntool.

While recent efforts have explored\nadversarial-based UDA methods for MLIC, they typically include an additional\ndiscriminator subnet. Nevertheless, decoupling the classification and the\ndiscrimination tasks may harm their task-specific discriminative power. Herein,\nwe address this challenge by presenting a novel adversarial critic directly\nderived from the task-specific classifier. Specifically, we employ a\ntwo-component Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to model both source and target\npredictions, distinguishing between two distinct clusters. Instead of using the\ntraditional Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, our approach utilizes a\nDeep Neural Network (DNN) to estimate the parameters of each GMM component.\nSubsequently, the source and target GMM parameters are leveraged to formulate\nan adversarial loss using the Fr\\'echet distance. The proposed framework is\ntherefore not only fully differentiable but is also cost-effective as it avoids\nthe expensive iterative process usually induced by the standard EM method. The\nproposed method is evaluated on several multi-label image datasets covering\nthree different types of domain shift.

While these biased features enhance\nperformance on the training data, they result in substantial performance\ndegradation when applied to unbiased datasets. One common solution is to\nperform dataset alignment through generative reconstruction, matching the\nsemantic content between real and synthetic images. However, we revisit this\napproach and show that pixel-level alignment alone is insufficient. The\nreconstructed images still suffer from frequency-level misalignment, which can\nperpetuate spurious correlations. To illustrate, we observe that reconstruction\nmodels tend to restore the high-frequency details lost in real images (possibly\ndue to JPEG compression), inadvertently creating a frequency-level\nmisalignment, where synthetic images appear to have richer high-frequency\ncontent than real ones. This misalignment leads to models associating\nhigh-frequency features with synthetic labels, further reinforcing biased cues.\nTo resolve this, we propose Dual Data Alignment (DDA), which aligns both the\npixel and frequency domains.

Fusing\nmonocular priors has been proven helpful for ill-posed matching, but the biased\nmonocular prior learned from small stereo datasets constrains the\ngeneralization. Recently, stereo matching has progressed by leveraging the\nunbiased monocular prior from the vision foundation model (VFM) to improve the\ngeneralization in ill-posed regions. We dive into the fusion process and\nobserve three main problems limiting the fusion of the VFM monocular prior. The\nfirst problem is the misalignment between affine-invariant relative monocular\ndepth and absolute depth of disparity. Besides, when we use the monocular\nfeature in an iterative update structure, the over-confidence in the disparity\nupdate leads to local optima results. A direct fusion of a monocular depth map\ncould alleviate the local optima problem, but noisy disparity results computed\nat the first several iterations will misguide the fusion. In this paper, we\npropose a binary local ordering map to guide the fusion, which converts the\ndepth map into a binary relative format, unifying the relative and absolute\ndepth representation. The computed local ordering map is also used to re-weight\nthe initial disparity update, resolving the local optima and noisy problem. In\naddition, we formulate the final direct fusion of monocular depth to the\ndisparity as a registration problem, where a pixel-wise linear regression\nmodule can globally and adaptively align them. Our method fully exploits the\nmonocular prior to support stereo matching results effectively and efficiently.\nWe significantly improve the performance from the experiments when generalizing\nfrom SceneFlow to Middlebury and Booster datasets while barely reducing the\nefficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08VFM\uff09\u7684\u5355\u76ee\u5148\u9a8c\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u7acb\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u4e2d\u75c5\u6001\u533a\u57df\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5c40\u90e8\u6392\u5e8f\u56fe\u548c\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u5757\u89e3\u51b3\u878d\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7acb\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u5728\u75c5\u6001\u533a\u57df\uff08\u5982\u906e\u6321\u548c\u975e\u6717\u4f2f\u8868\u9762\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5355\u76ee\u5148\u9a8c\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u504f\u5dee\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002VFM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e0\u504f\u5355\u76ee\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u878d\u5408\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5c40\u90e8\u6392\u5e8f\u56fe\u7edf\u4e00\u76f8\u5bf9\u548c\u7edd\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u521d\u59cb\u89c6\u5dee\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b\u5c06\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u76f4\u63a5\u878d\u5408\u4e3a\u89c6\u5dee\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u5757\u5168\u5c40\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4eceSceneFlow\u5230Middlebury\u548cBooster\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u51e0\u4e4e\u672a\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u5355\u76ee\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u652f\u6301\u7acb\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, the potential of\nreasoning-induced computational modeling has not been thoroughly explored in\nthe context of image quality assessment (IQA), a task critically dependent on\nvisual reasoning. In this paper, we introduce VisualQuality-R1, a\nreasoning-induced no-reference IQA (NR-IQA) model, and we train it with\nreinforcement learning to rank, a learning algorithm tailored to the\nintrinsically relative nature of visual quality. Specifically, for a pair of\nimages, we employ group relative policy optimization to generate multiple\nquality scores for each image. These estimates are then used to compute\ncomparative probabilities of one image having higher quality than the other\nunder the Thurstone model. Rewards for each quality estimate are defined using\ncontinuous fidelity measures rather than discretized binary labels.

However, our investigation reveals a\nrather sober lesson for existing LVU benchmarks. First, most existing\nbenchmarks rely heavily on multiple-choice questions (MCQs), whose evaluation\nresults are inflated due to the possibility of guessing the correct answer;\nSecond, a significant portion of questions in these benchmarks have strong\npriors to allow models to answer directly without even reading the input video.\nFor example, Gemini-1.5-Pro can achieve over 50\\% accuracy given a random frame\nfrom a long video on Video-MME.

As a result, the validity and robustness of current LVU\nbenchmarks are undermined, impeding a faithful assessment of LMMs' long-video\nunderstanding capability. To tackle this problem, we propose VideoEval-Pro, a\nrealistic LVU benchmark containing questions with open-ended short-answer,\nwhich truly require understanding the entire video. VideoEval-Pro assesses both\nsegment-level and full-video understanding through perception and reasoning\ntasks. By evaluating 21 proprietary and open-source video LMMs, we conclude the\nfollowing findings: (1) video LMMs show drastic performance ($>$25\\%) drops on\nopen-ended questions compared with MCQs; (2) surprisingly, higher MCQ scores do\nnot lead to higher open-ended scores on VideoEval-Pro; (3) compared to other\nMCQ benchmarks, VideoEval-Pro benefits more from increasing the number of input\nframes.

To support this, we\nintroduce a new multimodal dataset constructed from real-world conversational\nvideos, containing temporally aligned visual, auditory, and textual streams.\nThis dataset enables fine-grained modeling of response timing in dyadic\ninteractions. Building on this dataset, we propose MM-When2Speak, a multimodal\nLLM-based model that adaptively integrates visual, auditory, and textual\ncontext to predict when a response should occur, and what type of response is\nappropriate. Experiments show that MM-When2Speak significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art unimodal and LLM-based baselines, achieving up to a 4x\nimprovement in response timing accuracy over leading commercial LLMs. These\nresults underscore the importance of multimodal inputs for producing timely,\nnatural, and engaging conversational AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u6a21\u578bMM-When2Speak\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u542c\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u673a\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u5224\u65ad\u4f55\u65f6\u53d1\u8a00\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u77ed\u65f6\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u4e3a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faMM-When2Speak\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u542c\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u53f7\u9884\u6d4b\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u673a\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cMM-When2Speak\u5728\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u673a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u548cLLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe4\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u53ca\u65f6\u7684\u5bf9\u8bddAI\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Recent research in large language models (LLMs), such as\nDeepSeek-R1, has shown that reinforcement learning techniques like GRPO can\nenable pre-trained LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities using simple\nquestion-answer pairs. In this paper, we aim to train visual language models\n(VLMs) to perform reasoning on image data through reinforcement learning and\nvisual question-answer pairs, without any explicit chain-of-thought (CoT)\nsupervision. Our findings indicate that simply applying reinforcement learning\nto a VLM -- by prompting the model to produce a reasoning chain before\nproviding an answer -- can lead the model to develop shortcuts from easy\nquestions, thereby reducing its ability to generalize across unseen data\ndistributions.

While recent neural\ncompression approaches have shown promise, they still struggle with fundamental\nchallenges: preserving perceptual quality at high compression ratios,\ncomputational efficiency, and adaptability to diverse visual content. This\npaper introduces GANCompress, a novel neural compression framework that\nsynergistically combines Binary Spherical Quantization (BSQ) with Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs) to address these challenges. Our approach employs a\ntransformer-based autoencoder with an enhanced BSQ bottleneck that projects\nlatent representations onto a hypersphere, enabling efficient discretization\nwith bounded quantization error. This is followed by a specialized GAN\narchitecture incorporating frequency-domain attention and color consistency\noptimization. Experimental results demonstrate that GANCompress achieves\nsubstantial improvement in compression efficiency -- reducing file sizes by up\nto 100x with minimal visual distortion.

However, FL models often suffer performance\ndegradation due to distribution shifts between training and deployment.\nTest-Time Adaptation (TTA) offers a promising solution by allowing models to\nadapt using only test samples. However, existing TTA methods in FL face\nchallenges such as computational overhead, privacy risks from feature sharing,\nand scalability concerns due to memory constraints. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Federated Continual Test-Time Adaptation (FedCTTA), a\nprivacy-preserving and computationally efficient framework for federated\nadaptation. Unlike prior methods that rely on sharing local feature statistics,\nFedCTTA avoids direct feature exchange by leveraging similarity-aware\naggregation based on model output distributions over randomly generated noise\nsamples. This approach ensures adaptive knowledge sharing while preserving data\nprivacy.

However, the KAN can be orders of\nmagnitude slower due to its increased computational cost and training\ninstability, limiting its applicability to larger-scale tasks. Recently, the\nKolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT) has been proposed, which can achieve FLOPs\nsimilar to the traditional Transformer with MLPs by leveraging Group-Rational\nKAN (GR-KAN). Unfortunately, despite the comparable FLOPs, our\ncharacterizations reveal that the KAT is still 123x slower in training speeds,\nindicating that there are other performance bottlenecks beyond FLOPs. In this\npaper, we conduct a series of experiments to understand the root cause of the\nslowdown in KAT. We uncover that the slowdown can be isolated to memory stalls\nand, more specifically, in the backward pass of GR-KAN caused by inefficient\ngradient accumulation. To address this memory bottleneck, we propose FlashKAT,\nwhich builds on our restructured kernel that minimizes gradient accumulation\nwith atomic adds and accesses to slow memory.

However, most tools for estimating cortical surfaces work\nexclusively on scans with at least 1 mm isotropic resolution and are tuned to a\nspecific magnetic resonance (MR) contrast, often T1-weighted (T1w). This\nprecludes application using most clinical MR scans, which are very\nheterogeneous in terms of contrast and resolution. Here, we use synthetic\ndomain-randomized data to train the first neural network for explicit\nestimation of cortical surfaces from scans of any contrast and resolution,\nwithout retraining. Our method deforms a template mesh to the white matter (WM)\nsurface, which guarantees topological correctness. This mesh is further\ndeformed to estimate the GM surface. We compare our method to\nrecon-all-clinical (RAC), an implicit surface reconstruction method which is\ncurrently the only other tool capable of processing heterogeneous clinical MR\nscans, on ADNI and a large clinical dataset (n=1,332). We show a approximately\n50 % reduction in cortical thickness error (from 0.50 to 0.24 mm) with respect\nto RAC and better recovery of the aging-related cortical thinning patterns\ndetected by FreeSurfer on high-resolution T1w scans.

Shum"], "title": "Large-Scale Multi-Character Interaction Synthesis", "categories": ["cs.GR", "cs.CV"], "comment": null, "summary": "Generating large-scale multi-character interactions is a challenging and\nimportant task in character animation. Multi-character interactions involve not\nonly natural interactive motions but also characters coordinated with each\nother for transition. For example, a dance scenario involves characters dancing\nwith partners and also characters coordinated to new partners based on spatial\nand temporal observations. We term such transitions as coordinated interactions\nand decompose them into interaction synthesis and transition planning. Previous\nmethods of single-character animation do not consider interactions that are\ncritical for multiple characters. Deep-learning-based interaction synthesis\nusually focuses on two characters and does not consider transition planning.\nOptimization-based interaction synthesis relies on manually designing objective\nfunctions that may not generalize well. While crowd simulation involves more\ncharacters, their interactions are sparse and passive. We identify two\nchallenges to multi-character interaction synthesis, including the lack of data\nand the planning of transitions among close and dense interactions.

These results highlight\nreinforcing cognitive experts as a promising, practical, and interpretable\ndirection to enhance cognitive efficiency within advanced reasoning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRICE\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08cognitive experts\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u590d\u6742\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u6216\u601d\u8003\u4e0d\u8db3\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u70b9\u95f4\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff08nPMI\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u5f3a\u5316\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cRICE\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "RICE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}
