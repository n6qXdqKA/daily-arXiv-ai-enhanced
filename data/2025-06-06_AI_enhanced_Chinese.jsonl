A key limitation of existing\nadversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation\nbudget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness\ncharacteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce\ninstance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static\napproximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon\nScheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial\nperturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates\nthree key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via\ngradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,\nand (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these\ncues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget\ndynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results\non CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both\nadversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon\nbaselines and prior adaptive methods. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights\ninto the stability and convergence of our scheduling policy.

In most scenarios,\ndiffusion-based editing of protected images generates a desirable output image\nwhich adheres precisely to the guidance prompt. Our findings suggest that\nadding noise to images may paradoxically increase their association with given\ntext prompts during the generation process, leading to unintended consequences\nsuch as better resultant edits. Hence, we argue that perturbation-based methods\nmay not provide a sufficient solution for robust image protection against\ndiffusion-based editing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u963b\u6b62\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u53ef\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Stable Diffusion\uff09\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6ee5\u7528\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\uff08\u81ea\u7136\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u827a\u672f\u4f5c\u54c1\uff09\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u7f16\u8f91\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4ecd\u80fd\u88ab\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4e14\u6270\u52a8\u53ef\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u9488\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002"}}

Project Page:\n  https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/hmar/", "summary": "Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed\nand quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR\nreformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive\nresolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all\nthe tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in\nall previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from\nreduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a\nresolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image\nresolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.\n  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image\ngeneration algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction\nand masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR\nreformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the\nprediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its\nimmediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.\nWhen predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked\ngeneration procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On\nImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform\nparameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop\nefficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve\nfaster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x\nrespectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint.

Ideally, a\nface recognition system should perform well across different head poses, which\nis known as pose-invariant face recognition. To achieve pose invariance,\ncurrent approaches rely on sophisticated methods, such as face frontalization\nand various facial feature extraction model architectures. However, these\nmethods are somewhat impractical in real-life settings and are typically\nevaluated on small scientific datasets, such as Multi-PIE. In this work, we\npropose the inverse method of face frontalization, called face\ndefrontalization, to augment the training dataset of facial feature extraction\nmodel. The method does not introduce any time overhead during the inference\nstep. The method is composed of: 1) training an adapted face defrontalization\nFFWM model on a frontal-profile pairs dataset, which has been preprocessed\nusing our proposed face alignment method; 2) training a ResNet-50 facial\nfeature extraction model based on ArcFace loss on a raw and randomly\ndefrontalized large-scale dataset, where defrontalization was performed with\nour previously trained face defrontalization model.

We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a\npair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that\ntransformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic\nstructural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that\ndisentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we\nfound that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.\nTo overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in\nGalois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more\ngeneral representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature\nextraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,\nwhich prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple\nmethod to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by\ncombining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel\ntranslation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as\ngrouping features under the same transformation.

However,\ncurrent synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as\nmultiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category\nlabels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce\nGen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer\nDiffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks\nand diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt\nagent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground\ninstance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the\ngeneration of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and\nclean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out\nlow-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are\nrefined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine\nmultiple instances within scenes.

As the adapted models inevitably encounter\nout-of-distribution (OOD) test data that deviates from the in-distribution (ID)\ntask-specific training data, enhancing OOD generalization in few-shot\nadaptation is critically important. We study robust few-shot VLM adaptation,\naiming to increase both ID and OOD accuracy. By comparing different adaptation\nmethods (e.g., prompt tuning, linear probing, contrastive finetuning, and full\nfinetuning), we uncover three key findings: (1) finetuning with proper\nhyperparameters significantly outperforms the popular VLM adaptation methods\nprompt tuning and linear probing; (2) visual encoder-only finetuning achieves\nbetter efficiency and accuracy than contrastively finetuning both visual and\ntextual encoders; (3) finetuning the top layers of the visual encoder provides\nthe best balance between ID and OOD accuracy. Building on these findings, we\npropose partial finetuning of the visual encoder empowered with two simple\naugmentation techniques: (1) retrieval augmentation which retrieves\ntask-relevant data from the VLM's pretraining dataset to enhance adaptation,\nand (2) adversarial perturbation which promotes robustness during finetuning.\nResults show that the former/latter boosts OOD/ID accuracy while slightly\nsacrificing the ID/OOD accuracy. Yet, perhaps understandably, naively combining\nthe two does not maintain their best OOD/ID accuracy.

Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos\noffers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and\nsimplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While\nimitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert\ndemonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements,\nlearning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios.\nTo address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with\nEquivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE).

By incorporating a\ndiffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and\nsampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization.\nAdditionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric\nsymmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process. To address\nstate mismatches, we develop a forward-process guided action inference strategy\nfor conditional sampling. Using an ESD video dataset of nearly 2000 clips,\nexperimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods,\nboth explicit and implicit, in trajectory prediction.

This pipeline preserves\ndataset-specific annotation granularity while enabling many-to-one label space\ntransfer across heterogeneous datasets, resulting in a semantically and\nspatially aligned representation suitable for training a downstream detector.\nLAT thus jointly addresses both class-level misalignments and bounding box\ninconsistencies without relying on shared label spaces or manual annotations.\nAcross multiple benchmarks, LAT demonstrates consistent improvements in\ntarget-domain detection performance, achieving gains of up to +4.8AP over\nsemi-supervised baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "LAT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6807\u7b7e\u5bf9\u9f50\u8f6c\u79fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u95f4\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u7b7e\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u6846\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u5171\u4eab\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u6216\u624b\u52a8\u91cd\u6807\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u56fa\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u6807\u7b7e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "LAT\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u6743\u63d0\u6848\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08PPG\uff09\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\uff08SFF\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6807\u7b7e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "LAT\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347+4.8AP\u3002", "conclusion": "LAT\u65e0\u9700\u5171\u4eab\u6807\u7b7e\u7a7a\u95f4\u6216\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Building on this\ninsight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation\nPotential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's\npotential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary\nestimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential\noutcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors\nby comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention\nConfidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to\ndiscard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in\nintermediate reasoning stages.

Yet their adoption brings a\nfundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial\nmanipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust.\nTraditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses\n-- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if\nthis is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not\nsomething to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a\nprovocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training\nmodels to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress\nsensitivity from the ground up.

VAR iteratively estimates the\nresidual in latent space between gradually increasing image scales, a process\nreferred to as next-scale prediction. Thus, the strong priors learned during\npre-training align well with the downstream task (ISR). To our knowledge, only\nVARSR has exploited this synergy so far, showing promising results. However,\ndue to the limitations of existing residual quantizers, VARSR works only at a\nfixed resolution, i.e. it fails to map intermediate outputs to the\ncorresponding image scales. Additionally, it relies on a 1B transformer\narchitecture (VAR-d24), and leverages a large-scale private dataset to achieve\nstate-of-the-art results. We address these limitations through two novel\ncomponents: a) a Hierarchical Image Tokenization approach with a multi-scale\nimage tokenizer that progressively represents images at different scales while\nsimultaneously enforcing token overlap across scales, and b) a Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) regularization term that, relying solely on the\nLR and HR tokenizations, encourages the transformer to produce the latter over\nthe former. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a quantizer is\ntrained to force semantically consistent residuals at different scales, and the\nfirst time that preference-based optimization is used to train a VAR.

However, this has come at the cost of representation\ndiversity. While automatic evaluation methods exist for benchmarking model\ndiversity, they either require reference image datasets or lack specificity\nabout the kind of diversity measured, limiting their adaptability and\ninterpretability. To address this gap, we introduce the Does-it/Can-it\nframework, DIM-CIM, a reference-free measurement of default-mode diversity\n(\"Does\" the model generate images with expected attributes?) and generalization\ncapacity (\"Can\" the model generate diverse attributes for a particular\nconcept?). We construct the COCO-DIMCIM benchmark, which is seeded with COCO\nconcepts and captions and augmented by a large language model.

Although existing methods have primarily focused on detecting\nanomalous objects in videos -- either by identifying anomalous frames or\nobjects -- they often neglect finer-grained analysis, such as anomalous pixels,\nwhich limits their ability to capture a broader range of anomalies. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object\n(TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for\nthe first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous\nobjects into a unified framework.

Many existing\nworld modeling pipelines are based on implicit generative models, which are\nhard to train and often lack 3D or physical consistency. On the other hand,\nexplicit 3D methods built from a single state often require multi-stage\nprocessing-such as segmentation, background completion, and inpainting-due to\nocclusions. To address this, we leverage two perturbed observations of the same\nscene under different object configurations. These dual states offer\ncomplementary visibility, alleviating occlusion issues during state transitions\nand enabling more stable and complete reconstruction. In this paper, we present\nDSG-World, a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly constructs a 3D\nGaussian World model from Dual State observations. Our approach builds dual\nsegmentation-aware Gaussian fields and enforces bidirectional photometric and\nsemantic consistency.

However, the\nlikelihood displacement observed in DPO indicates that both $\\log \\pi_\\theta\n(y_w\\mid x)$ and $\\log \\pi_\\theta (y_l\\mid x) $ often decrease during training,\ninadvertently boosting the probabilities of non-target responses. In this\npaper, we systematically revisit this phenomenon from LLMs to Video-LLMs,\nshowing that it intensifies when dealing with the redundant complexity of video\ncontent. To alleviate the impact of this phenomenon, we propose \\emph{Lean\nPreference Optimization} (LeanPO), a reference-free approach that reformulates\nthe implicit reward as the average likelihood of the response with respect to\nthe policy model. A key component of LeanPO is the reward-trustworthiness\ncorrelated self-generated preference data pipeline, which carefully infuses\nrelevant prior knowledge into the model while continuously refining the\npreference data via self-reflection.

TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving and provides 180K\ntriplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving. Previous CoVR benchmarks focusing\non temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the\nsame video, limiting practical usefulness.

Some recent works define 3D Gaussian primitives in the\ncanonical space and use deformation fields to map canonical primitives to\nobservation spaces, achieving real-time dynamic view synthesis. However, these\nmethods often struggle to handle scenes with complex motions due to the\ndifficulty of optimizing deformation fields. To overcome this problem, we\npropose FreeTimeGS, a novel 4D representation that allows Gaussian primitives\nto appear at arbitrary time and locations.

It requires interpreting\nfine-grained visual information, accurately reading handwritten or digital\ntext, and integrating spoken cues, often dispersed non-linearly over time. In\nsuch multimodal contexts, success hinges not just on perception, but on\nselectively identifying and integrating the right contextual details from a\nrich and noisy stream of content. To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a\nbenchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally\nextended cross-modal reasoning on videos. The benchmark spans 10 diverse\nmathematical domains, covering videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour.\nIt requires models to interpret structured visual content, understand\ninstructional narratives, and jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and\ntextual modalities. We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality,\ntotaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation. To reflect real-world scenarios,\nquestions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem\nsolving, where answers are grounded in the presented question; conceptual\ntransfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep\ninstructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended\nexplanations and partially worked-out solutions. Each question includes\nmulti-step reasoning annotations, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of model\ncapabilities. Through this benchmark, we highlight the limitations of existing\napproaches and establish a systematic evaluation framework for models that must\nreason, rather than merely perceive, across temporally extended and\nmodality-rich mathematical problem settings.

In this work, we\naddress the problem of denoising images degraded by Poisson noise under extreme\nlow-light conditions. We introduce a light-weight deep learning-based method\nthat integrates Retinex based decomposition with Poisson denoising into a\nunified encoder-decoder network.

We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for\nmodel and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be\npreferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on\ndense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are\nderived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,\nthat use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative\nloss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use\nderived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's\nstronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard\nCLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for\nvarious downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for\ndifferent open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the\nsame trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving\nscaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.\nAccurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and\ndataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on\nmeasurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic\ncomparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their\ncreation.

Recent work has linked\nEBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained\nthrough a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the\ninstabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work\nwith bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize\nan upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on\nthe log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds\nbased on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual\ninformation.

With dense voxel labels, prior works\ntypically formulate it as a dense segmentation task, independently classifying\neach voxel. However, this paradigm neglects critical instance-centric\ndiscriminability, leading to instance-level incompleteness and adjacent\nambiguities. To address this, we highlight a free lunch of occupancy labels:\nthe voxel-level class label implicitly provides insight at the instance level,\nwhich is overlooked by the community. Motivated by this observation, we first\nintroduce a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick: a simple yet\neffective method that freely converts voxel-level class labels into\ninstance-level offset labels. Building on this, we further propose VoxDet, an\ninstance-centric framework that reformulates the voxel-level occupancy\nprediction as dense object detection by decoupling it into two sub-tasks:\noffset regression and semantic prediction. Specifically, based on the lifted 3D\nvolume, VoxDet first uses (a) Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder to generate\ndisentangled feature volumes for the two sub-tasks, which learn task-specific\nspatial deformation in the densely projected tri-perceptive space. Then, we\ndeploy (b) Task-decoupled Dense Predictor to address this task via dense\ndetection. Here, we first regress a 4D offset field to estimate distances (6\ndirections) between voxels and object borders in the voxel space. The regressed\noffsets are then used to guide the instance-level aggregation in the\nclassification branch, achieving instance-aware prediction. Experiments show\nthat VoxDet can be deployed on both camera and LiDAR input, jointly achieving\nstate-of-the-art results on both benchmarks.

Specifically, we identify the impact of a\nkey family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call\ncross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust\nclassification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a\nsynthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model\narchitectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the\nmodel tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness\ncheckpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust\noverfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific\nfeatures. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two\nexisting properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and\nrobust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of\nAT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them.

Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to\ncapture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently\nregularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow\nmatching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally\nprove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally\ntractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the\nlog-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed\nmethod eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids\nODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a\ncontrolled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the\nnegative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the\neffectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments\non ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed\ndiscussions and ablation studies.
