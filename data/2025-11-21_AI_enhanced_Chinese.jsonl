Despite significant progress, building a universal VTON framework that can flexibly handle diverse and complex tasks remains a major challenge. Recent methods explore multi-task VTON frameworks guided by textual instructions, yet they still face two key limitations: (1) semantic gap between text instructions and reference images, and (2) data scarcity in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniFit, a universal VTON framework driven by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Specifically, we introduce an MLLM-Guided Semantic Alignment Module (MGSA), which integrates multimodal inputs using an MLLM and a set of learnable queries. By imposing a semantic alignment loss, MGSA captures cross-modal semantic relationships and provides coherent and explicit semantic guidance for the generative process, thereby reducing the semantic gap. Moreover, by devising a two-stage progressive training strategy with a self-synthesis pipeline, UniFit is able to learn complex tasks from limited data. Extensive experiments show that UniFit not only supports a wide range of VTON tasks, including multi-garment and model-to-model try-on, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance.

For seen objects, high accuracy is often attainable via per-object fine-tuning but generalizing to unseen objects remains a challenge. To address this problem, past arts assume access to CAD models at test time and typically follow a multi-stage pipeline to estimate poses: detect and segment the object, propose an initial pose, and then refine it. Under occlusion, however, the early-stage of such pipelines are prone to errors, which can propagate through the sequential processing, and consequently degrade the performance. To remedy this shortcoming, we propose four novel extensions to model-based 6D pose estimation methods: (i) a dynamic non-uniform dense sampling strategy that focuses computation on visible regions, reducing occlusion-induced errors; (ii) a multi-hypothesis inference mechanism that retains several confidence-ranked pose candidates, mitigating brittle single-path failures; (iii) iterative refinement to progressively improve pose accuracy; and (iv) series of occlusion-focused training augmentations that strengthen robustness and generalization. Furthermore, we propose a new weighted by visibility metric for evaluation under occlusion to minimize the bias in the existing protocols. Via extensive empirical evaluations, we show that our proposed approach achieves more than 5% improvement in accuracy on ICBIN and more than 2% on BOP dataset benchmarks, while achieving approximately 3 times faster inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u76846D\u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u52a8\u6001\u975e\u5747\u5300\u5bc6\u96c6\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u7cbe\u70bc\u548c\u906e\u6321\u8bad\u7ec3\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5728\u906e\u6321\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76846D\u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u906e\u6321\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9519\u8bef\u4f1a\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u540e\u7eed\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u906e\u6321\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u79cd\u6269\u5c55\uff1a(1)\u52a8\u6001\u975e\u5747\u5300\u5bc6\u96c6\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u53ef\u89c1\u533a\u57df\uff1b(2)\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u591a\u4e2a\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u5019\u9009\uff1b(3)\u8fed\u4ee3\u7cbe\u70bc\u9010\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b(4)\u906e\u6321\u8bad\u7ec3\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728ICBIN\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc75%\uff0c\u5728BOP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc72%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u7ea63\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u906e\u6321\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u76846D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, most deep learning-based methods heavily rely on large amounts of annotated training data, which are typically unavailable for historical maps, especially for those belonging to specific, homogeneous cartographic domains, also known as corpora. Creating high-quality training data suitable for machine learning often takes a significant amount of time and involves extensive manual effort. While synthetic training data can alleviate the scarcity of real-world samples, it often lacks the affinity (realism) and diversity (variation) necessary for effective learning. By transferring the cartographic style of an original historical map corpus onto vector data, we bootstrap an effectively unlimited number of synthetic historical maps suitable for tasks such as land-cover interpretation of a homogeneous historical map corpus.

There are three main approaches in this domain; Model-based methods assume an exact CAD model at inference but require high-resolution meshes and transfer poorly to new environments; Model-free methods that rely on a few reference images or videos are more flexible, however often fail under challenging conditions; Category-level approaches aim to balance flexibility and accuracy but many are overly general and ignore environment and object priors, limiting their practicality in industrial settings.\n  To this end, we propose Box6d, a category-level 6D pose estimation method tailored for storage boxes in the warehouse context. From a single RGB-D observation, Box6D infers the dimensions of the boxes via a fast binary search and estimates poses using a category CAD template rather than instance-specific models. Suing a depth-based plausibility filter and early-stopping strategy, Box6D then rejects implausible hypotheses, lowering computational cost.

We propose a two-stage self-improvement paradigm to bridge this gap without new annotations. First, we prompt the VLMs to generate detailed textual rationales for each video, compelling them to articulate the domain-specific logic. The VLM is then fine-tuned on these self-generated rationales, utilizing this intermediate supervision to align its representations with the nuances of the target domain. Second, conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is performed on the task labels, achieving markedly higher effectiveness as a result of the model's pre-acquired domain reasoning.

Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has played a pivotal role in multimodal learning. However, its focus on single-label, single-granularity alignment limits its effectiveness in complex domains such as medical imaging, where images often correspond to multiple high-level labels (e.g., disease categories) across different annotation granularities (e.g., diagnostic description, clinical explanation). To address this, we propose Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a contrastive learning framework designed to improve both multi-label and cross-granularity alignment. MGLL leverages structured multi-label supervision, integrates textual descriptions across granularities, and introduces soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints to enhance alignment. MGLL employs smooth Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to ensure cross-granularity consistency while maintaining computational efficiency as a plug-and-play module for vision-language models. Pretrained on our constructed large-scale multi-granular datasets and evaluated across multiple datasets, MGLL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks.

We propose an automated method to select standard 2D views from 3D cardiac ultrasound volumes, allowing physicians to interpret the data in their usual format while benefiting from the speed and usability of 3D scanning. Applying a deep learning view classifier and downstream heuristics based on anatomical landmarks together with heuristics provided by cardiologists, we reconstruct standard echocardiography views. This approach was validated by three cardiologists in blinded evaluation (96\\% accuracy in 1,600 videos from 2 hospitals).

In contrast, promptable segmentation models such as SAM2 enable precise user interaction but lack semantic or relational reasoning. We introduce Click2Graph, the first interactive framework for Panoptic Video Scene Graph Generation (PVSG) that unifies visual prompting with spatial, temporal, and semantic understanding. From a single user cue, such as a click or bounding box, Click2Graph segments and tracks the subject across time, autonomously discovers interacting objects, and predicts <subject, object, predicate> triplets to form a temporally consistent scene graph. Our framework introduces two key components: a Dynamic Interaction Discovery Module that generates subject-conditioned object prompts, and a Semantic Classification Head that performs joint entity and predicate reasoning.

However, existing methods that fine-tune CLIP for segmentation on limited seen categories often lead to overfitting and degrade the pretrained vision-language alignment. To stabilize modality alignment during fine-tuning, we propose InfoCLIP, which leverages an information-theoretic perspective to transfer alignment knowledge from pretrained CLIP to the segmentation task. Specifically, this transfer is guided by two novel objectives grounded in mutual information. First, we compress the pixel-text modality alignment from pretrained CLIP to reduce noise arising from its coarse-grained local semantic representations learned under image-text supervision. Second, we maximize the mutual information between the alignment knowledge of pretrained CLIP and the fine-tuned model to transfer compact local semantic relations suited for the segmentation task.

Through systematic analysis, we find that conventional demonstration selection (DS) strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars. To address this, we propose Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which builds demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations via clustering-based sampling. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy, offering an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning.

This problem becomes particularly challenging in the presence of long-tailed in-distribution (ID) datasets, often leading to high false positive rates (FPR) and low tail-class ID classification accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that exploiting inter-sample relationships using a graph-based representation can significantly improve OOD detection in long-tailed recognition of vision datasets. To this end, we use the feature space of a pre-trained model to initialize our graph structure. We account for the differences between the activation layer distribution of the pre-training vs. training data, and actively introduce Gaussianization to alleviate any deviations from a standard normal distribution in the activation layers of the pre-trained model. We then refine this initial graph representation using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to arrive at a feature space suitable for long-tailed OOD detection. This leads us to address the inferior performance observed in ID tail-classes within existing OOD detection methods.

Wearable attacks offer a realistic threat model, yet existing approaches usually optimize textures frame by frame and therefore fail to maintain concealment across long video sequences with motion, pose changes, and garment deformation. In this work, a sequence-level optimization framework is introduced to generate natural, printable adversarial textures for shirts, trousers, and hats that remain effective throughout entire walking videos in both digital and physical settings. Product images are first mapped to UV space and converted into a compact palette and control-point parameterization, with ICC locking to keep all colors printable. A physically based human-garment pipeline is then employed to simulate motion, multi-angle camera viewpoints, cloth dynamics, and illumination variation. An expectation-over-transformation objective with temporal weighting is used to optimize the control points so that detection confidence is minimized across whole sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong and stable concealment, high robustness to viewpoint changes, and superior cross-model transferability.

In real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR), existing approaches mainly rely on fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images. However, these dense Real-ISR models are limited in their ability to adaptively capture the heterogeneous characteristics of complex real-world degraded samples or enable knowledge sharing between inputs under equivalent computational budgets. To address this, we investigate the integration of sparse MoE into Real-ISR and propose a Mixture-of-Ranks (MoR) architecture for single-step image super-resolution. We introduce a fine-grained expert partitioning strategy that treats each rank in LoRA as an independent expert. This design enables flexible knowledge recombination while isolating fixed-position ranks as shared experts to preserve common-sense features and minimize routing redundancy. Furthermore, we develop a degradation estimation module leveraging CLIP embeddings and predefined positive-negative text pairs to compute relative degradation scores, dynamically guiding expert activation. To better accommodate varying sample complexities, we incorporate zero-expert slots and propose a degradation-aware load-balancing loss, which dynamically adjusts the number of active experts based on degradation severity, ensuring optimal computational resource allocation.

This paper proposes a material classification technique using a speckle pattern of the material's surface based on deep learning to monitor and control the laser cutting process.

However, extending 3DGS to sparse-view settings remains challenging because of supervision scarcity and overfitting caused by limited viewpoint coverage. In this paper, we present CuriGS, a curriculum-guided framework for sparse-view 3D reconstruction using 3DGS. CuriGS addresses the core challenge of sparse-view synthesis by introducing student views: pseudo-views sampled around ground-truth poses (teacher). For each teacher, we generate multiple groups of student views with different perturbation levels. During training, we follow a curriculum schedule that gradually unlocks higher perturbation level, randomly sampling candidate students from the active level to assist training. Each sampled student is regularized via depth-correlation and co-regularization, and evaluated using a multi-signal metric that combines SSIM, LPIPS, and an image-quality measure. For every teacher and perturbation level, we periodically retain the best-performing students and promote those that satisfy a predefined quality threshold to the training set, resulting in a stable augmentation of sparse training views. Experimental results show that CuriGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both rendering fidelity and geometric consistency across various synthetic and real sparse-view scenes.

This includes the collection of heterogeneous data across multiple platforms, with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) seeing significant usage due to their high performance in crop monitoring, forecasting, and prediction tasks. Similarly, satellite missions have been shown to be effective for agriculturally relevant tasks. In contrast to UAVs, such missions are bound to the limitation of spatial resolution, which hinders their effectiveness for modern farming systems focused on micro-plot management. In this work, we propose a cross modal learning strategy that enriches high-resolution satellite imagery with UAV level visual detail for crop canopy trait estimation. Using a dataset of approximately co registered satellite UAV image pairs collected from replicated plots of 84 hybrid maize varieties across five distinct locations in the U.S. Corn Belt, we train a model that learns fine grained spectral spatial correspondences between sensing modalities. Results show that the generated UAV-like representations from satellite inputs consistently outperform real satellite imagery on multiple downstream tasks, including yield and nitrogen prediction, demonstrating the potential of cross-modal correspondence learning to bridge the gap between satellite and UAV sensing in agricultural monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f5c\u7269\u51a0\u5c42\u6027\u72b6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u4ea7\u91cf\u548c\u6c2e\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5fae\u5730\u5757\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u73b0\u4ee3\u519c\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53d7\u5230\u963b\u788d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd1\u4f3c\u914d\u51c6\u7684\u536b\u661f-\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u540c\u4f20\u611f\u6a21\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5149\u8c31\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4ea7\u91cf\u548c\u6c2e\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u5f25\u5408\u519c\u4e1a\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u536b\u661f\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f20\u611f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

While Key and Value (KV) caching in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively studied, next-scale prediction presents unique challenges, and KV caching design for next-scale based VAR transformers remains largely unexplored. A major bottleneck is the excessive KV memory growth with the increasing number of scales-severely limiting scalability. Our systematic investigation reveals that: (1) Attending to tokens from local scales significantly contributes to generation quality (2) Allocating a small amount of memory for the coarsest scales, termed as condensed scales, stabilizes multi-scale image generation (3) Strong KV similarity across finer scales is predominantly observed in cache-efficient layers, whereas cache-demanding layers exhibit weaker inter-scale similarity. Based on the observations, we introduce AMS-KV, a scale-adaptive KV caching policy for next-scale prediction in VAR models. AMS-KV prioritizes storing KVs from condensed and local scales, preserving the most relevant tokens to maintain generation quality. It further optimizes KV cache utilization and computational efficiency identifying cache-demanding layers through inter-scale similarity analysis. Compared to the vanilla next-scale prediction-based VAR models, AMS-KV reduces KV cache usage by up to 84.83% and self-attention latency by 60.48%.

This task is inherently challenging due to the sensor's unique spherical geometry, the temporal sparsity of point clouds, and the complexity of dynamic scenes. To address these challenges, we present LiSTAR, a novel generative world model that operates directly on the sensor's native geometry. LiSTAR introduces a Hybrid-Cylindrical-Spherical (HCS) representation to preserve data fidelity by mitigating quantization artifacts common in Cartesian grids. To capture complex dynamics from sparse temporal data, it utilizes a Spatio-Temporal Attention with Ray-Centric Transformer (START) that explicitly models feature evolution along individual sensor rays for robust temporal coherence. Furthermore, for controllable synthesis, we propose a novel 4D point cloud-aligned voxel layout for conditioning and a corresponding discrete Masked Generative START (MaskSTART) framework, which learns a compact, tokenized representation of the scene, enabling efficient, high-resolution, and layout-guided compositional generation. Comprehensive experiments validate LiSTAR's state-of-the-art performance across 4D LiDAR reconstruction, prediction, and conditional generation, with substantial quantitative gains: reducing generation MMD by a massive 76%, improving reconstruction IoU by 32%, and lowering prediction L1 Med by 50%.

It comprises three stages: (1) A hierarchical text-guided frame sampler to emulate human attention; (2) A reasoning model that produces spatial cues along with explicit reasoning chains; and (3) A segmentation-propagation stage using SAM2 and XMem. A task difficulty-aware mechanism adaptively controls reasoning length for better efficiency and accuracy.

This study introduces SpectralTrain, a universal, architecture-agnostic training framework that enhances learning efficiency by integrating curriculum learning (CL) with principal component analysis (PCA)-based spectral downsampling. By gradually introducing spectral complexity while preserving essential information, SpectralTrain enables efficient learning of spectral -- spatial patterns at significantly reduced computational costs. The framework is independent of specific architectures, optimizers, or loss functions and is compatible with both classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Indian Pines, Salinas-A, and the newly introduced CloudPatch-7 -- demonstrate strong generalization across spatial scales, spectral characteristics, and application domains. The results indicate consistent reductions in training time by 2-7x speedups with small-to-moderate accuracy deltas depending on backbone. Its application to cloud classification further reveals potential in climate-related remote sensing, emphasizing training strategy optimization as an effective complement to architectural design in HSI models.

Rad-GS combines the advantages of raw radar point cloud with Doppler information and geometrically enhanced point cloud to guide dynamic object masking in synchronized images, thereby alleviating rendering artifacts and improving localization accuracy. Additionally, unsynchronized image frames are leveraged to globally refine the 3D Gaussian representation, enhancing texture consistency and novel view synthesis fidelity.

Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that Rad-GS achieves performance comparable to traditional 3D Gaussian methods based on camera or LiDAR inputs, highlighting the feasibility of robust outdoor mapping using 4D mmWave radar.

Recent advances in visual in-context learning (VICL) demonstrate promising capabilities for solving downstream tasks by unified vision-language models (VLMs). When the visual prompt and the target images originate from different visual tasks, can VLMs still enable VICL? In the paper, we propose a fully collaborative pipeline, i.e. T2T-VICL, for VLMs to investigate the potential of cross-task VICL. Fundamentally, we design a mechanism to generate and select text prompts that best implicitly describe the differences between two distinct low-level vision tasks, and construct the first cross-task VICL dataset. Building upon this, we propose a novel inference framework that combines perceptual score-based reasoning with traditional evaluation metrics to perform cross-task VICL.

Thus, most flow-based Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) methods first predict bidirectional flows at low resolution and then use high-magnification upsampling (e.g., bilinear) to obtain the high-resolution ones. However, this kind of upsampling strategy may cause blur or mosaic at the flows' edges. Additionally, the motion of fine pixels at high resolution cannot be adequately captured in motion estimation at low resolution, which leads to the misalignment of task-oriented flows. With such inaccurate flows, input frames are warped and combined pixel-by-pixel, resulting in ghosting and discontinuities in the interpolated frame. In this study, we propose a novel VFI pipeline, VTinker, which consists of two core components: guided flow upsampling (GFU) and Texture Mapping. After motion estimation at low resolution, GFU introduces input frames as guidance to alleviate the blurring details in bilinear upsampling flows, which makes flows' edges clearer. Subsequently, to avoid pixel-level ghosting and discontinuities, Texture Mapping generates an initial interpolated frame, referred to as the intermediate proxy. The proxy serves as a cue for selecting clear texture blocks from the input frames, which are then mapped onto the proxy to facilitate producing the final interpolated frame via a reconstruction module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VTinker achieves state-of-the-art performance in VFI.

Although extensive efforts have been devoted to detecting AI-generated images, out-of-distribution generalization remains a persistent challenge.

To address this problem in a more controllable manner, we propose the Positive-Incentive Noise for CLIP (PiN-CLIP), which jointly trains a noise generator and a detection network under a variational positive-incentive principle. Specifically, we construct positive-incentive noise in the feature space via cross-attention fusion of visual and categorical semantic features. During optimization, the noise is injected into the feature space to fine-tune the visual encoder, suppressing shortcut-sensitive directions while amplifying stable forensic cues, thereby enabling the extraction of more robust and generalized artifact representations.

However, in real-world scenarios involving transcoding or transmission, QPs may be partially or entirely unknown, limiting the applicability of such approaches and motivating the development of blind QECV techniques. Current blind methods generate degradation vectors via classification models with cross-entropy loss, using them as channel attention to guide artifact removal. However, these vectors capture only global degradation information and lack spatial details, hindering adaptation to varying artifact patterns at different spatial positions. To address these limitations, we propose a pretrained Degradation Representation Learning (DRL) module that decouples and extracts high-dimensional, multiscale degradation representations from video content to guide the artifact removal. Additionally, both blind and non-blind methods typically employ uniform architectures across QPs, hence, overlooking the varying computational demands inherent to different compression levels. We thus introduce a hierarchical termination mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of artifact reduction stages based on the compression level. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances performance, achieving a PSNR improvement of 110% (from 0.31 dB to 0.65 dB) over a competing state-of-the-art blind method at QP = 22.

Recently, the scarcity of high spatial resolution datasets for WBCD restricts its application in urban and rural regions, which require more accurate positioning. Meanwhile, previous deep learning-based methods fail to comprehensively exploit the spatial semantic and structural information in deep features in the change detection networks. To resolve these concerns, we first propose a new dataset, HSRW-CD, with a spatial resolution higher than 3 meters for WBCD. Specifically, it contains a large number of image pairs, widely covering various water body types. Besides, a Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception (SSCP) attention module is designed to fully leverage both the spatial semantics and structure of deep features in the WBCD networks, significantly improving the discrimination capability for water body. The proposed SSCP has three components: the Multi-Semantic spatial Attention (MSA), the Structural Relation-aware Global Attention (SRGA), and the Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). The MSA enhances the spatial semantics of water body features and provides precise spatial semantic priors for the CSA. Then, the SRGA further extracts spatial structure to learn the spatial continuity of the water body. Finally, the CSA utilizes the spatial semantic and structural priors from the MSA and SRGA to compute the similarity across channels. Specifically designed as a plug-and-play module for water body deep features, the proposed SSCP allows integration into existing WBCD models. Numerous experiments conducted on the proposed HSRW-CD and Water-CD datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of the SSCP.

However, these maps lack the open-vocabulary semantic understanding required for advanced robotic interaction. Integrating language features into SLAM remains a significant challenge, as storing high-dimensional features demands excessive memory and rendering overhead, while existing methods with static models lack adaptability for novel environments. To address these limitations, we propose LEGO-SLAM (Language-Embedded Gaussian Optimization SLAM), the first framework to achieve real-time, open-vocabulary mapping within a 3DGS-based SLAM system. At the core of our method is a scene-adaptive encoder-decoder that distills high-dimensional language embeddings into a compact 16-dimensional feature space. This design reduces the memory per Gaussian and accelerates rendering, enabling real-time performance. Unlike static approaches, our encoder adapts online to unseen scenes.

While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can serve as strong embedding extractors, existing approaches treat embedding extraction as a direct encoding step, overlooking the fact that MLLMs possess the generative capability for reasoning that could be leveraged to enhance representation quality. In this work, we explore how to explicitly incorporate reasoning into the embedding process. To this end, we propose Reasoning Guided Embeddings (RGE), which preserves the generative rationale process of MLLMs and couples it with contrastive training. Our method first enables the model to perform structured rationale generation conditioned on the instruction, and then extracts representations after reasoning has unfolded. This simple design enhances the context-conditional inference signals within the embedding, leading to improved multimodal representation quality.

Drawing inspiration from human perception mechanisms, existing studies attempt to construct a coherent spatial understanding via grid-based cognitive maps from multi-frame visual inputs. However, current grid-based map methods rely on discretized raster representations, which limit the model's ability in fine-grained spatial reasoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose Video2Layout, a framework for reconstructing metric-grounded spatial layouts from video. The framework employs continuous object boundary coordinates to quantify inter-object physical distances and object size. This empowers the model with quantitative spatial computation capabilities, effectively alleviating the inherent ambiguity when describing spatial relationships in natural language. Specifically, our method comprises two core stages. First, in supervised fine-tuning stage, we construct a high-quality dataset from the AI2THOR simulator, which enables the model to learn the mapping from visual inputs to precise boundary coordinates. Subsequently, a reinforcement fine-tuning stage further enhances the model's real-world generalization capabilities. To systematically evaluate the correlation between cognitive map accuracy and image quantity, as well as how the quantity of image inputs affects spatial reasoning accuracy, we introduce QVS-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark designed to analyze the relevant mechanisms.

A persistent challenge in this field is simultaneously preserving fine-grained details present in the input while ensuring the global structural integrity of the completed shape. While recent works leveraging local symmetry transformations via direct regression have significantly improved the preservation of geometric structure details, these methods suffer from two major limitations: (1) These regression-based methods are prone to overfitting which tend to memorize instant-specific transformations instead of learning a generalizable geometric prior. (2) Their reliance on point-wise transformation regression lead to high sensitivity to input noise, severely degrading their robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce Simba, a novel framework that reformulates point-wise transformation regression as a distribution learning problem.

The mainstream solution is adversarial training (AT) to improve robustness; however, AT often brings a clean--robustness trade-off and high training/tuning cost, which limits scalability and maintainability in medical imaging. We propose \\emph{Layer-wise Noise-Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction (LNG-SWR)}. During training, we inject small, zero-mean noise at multiple layers to learn a frequency-bias prior that steers representations away from noise-sensitive directions. We then apply prior-guided selective wavelet reconstruction on the input/feature branch to achieve frequency adaptation: suppress noise-sensitive bands, enhance directional structures and shape cues, and stabilize boundary responses while maintaining spectral consistency. The framework is backbone-agnostic and adds low additional inference overhead. It can serve as a plug-in enhancement to AT and also improves robustness without AT. On CT and ultrasound datasets, under a unified protocol with PGD-$L_{\\infty}/L_{2}$ and SSAH, LNG-SWR delivers consistent gains on clean Dice/IoU and significantly reduces the performance drop under strong attacks; combining LNG-SWR with AT yields additive gains. When combined with adversarial training, robustness improves further without sacrificing clean accuracy, indicating an engineering-friendly and scalable path to robust segmentation. These results indicate that LNG-SWR provides a simple, effective, and engineering-friendly path to robust medical image segmentation in both adversarial and standard training regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLNG-SWR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u95f4\u566a\u58f0\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c0f\u6ce2\u91cd\u6784\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u727a\u7272\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ed3\u5408\u83b7\u5f97\u989d\u5916\u589e\u76ca", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u8981\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b58\u5728\u5e72\u51c0-\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6743\u8861\u548c\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027", "method": "\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5411\u591a\u4e2a\u5c42\u6ce8\u5165\u5c0f\u5e45\u5ea6\u96f6\u5747\u503c\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u9891\u7387\u504f\u7f6e\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c0f\u6ce2\u91cd\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u9891\u7387\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff1a\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u9891\u5e26\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fb9\u754c\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9891\u8c31\u4e00\u81f4\u6027", "result": "\u5728CT\u548c\u8d85\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cLNG-SWR\u5728\u5e72\u51c0Dice/IoU\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5f3a\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u9644\u52a0\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u5e72\u51c0\u7cbe\u5ea6", "conclusion": "LNG-SWR\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5de5\u7a0b\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f"}}

In particular, the number of tokens consumed during the generation process has emerged as a key evaluation metric.Prior studies have shown that specific inputs can induce VLMs to generate lengthy outputs with low information density, which significantly increases energy consumption, latency, and token costs. However, existing methods simply delay the occurrence of the EOS token to implicitly prolong output, and fail to directly maximize the output token length as an explicit optimization objective, lacking stability and controllability.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel verbose-text induction attack (VTIA) to inject imperceptible adversarial perturbations into benign images via a two-stage framework, which identifies the most malicious prompt embeddings for optimizing and maximizing the output token of the perturbed images.Specifically, we first perform adversarial prompt search, employing reinforcement learning strategies to automatically identify adversarial prompts capable of inducing the LLM component within VLMs to produce verbose outputs. We then conduct vision-aligned perturbation optimization to craft adversarial examples on input images, maximizing the similarity between the perturbed image's visual embeddings and those of the adversarial prompt, thereby constructing malicious images that trigger verbose text generation.

Current VLA models suffer from stage hallucination, where agents exploit coarse evaluation signals to shortcut multi-step tasks, reporting high progress without truly completing them. We present EvoVLA, a self-supervised VLA framework that addresses this issue through three complementary components: Stage-Aligned Reward (SAR), which uses triplet contrastive learning with Gemini-generated hard negatives to prevent visual shortcuts; Pose-Based Object Exploration (POE), which grounds curiosity in relative object-gripper pose instead of raw pixels; and Long-Horizon Memory, which uses selective context retention and gated fusion to stabilize intrinsic shaping during extended rollouts. Extensive evaluations on Discoverse-L, a long-horizon manipulation benchmark with three multi-stage tasks, show that EvoVLA improves average task success by 10.2 percentage points over the strongest baseline (OpenVLA-OFT), reaching 69.2 percent. EvoVLA also achieves one-and-a-half times better sample efficiency and reduces stage hallucination from 38.5 percent to 14.8 percent.

A key challenge is enhancing the multimodal dense prediction capability, specifically this pixel-level multimodal alignment. Although existing methods achieve promising results by leveraging CLIP's vision-language alignment, they rarely investigate the performance boundaries of CLIP for dense prediction from an interpretability mechanisms perspective. In this work, we systematically investigate CLIP's internal mechanisms and identify a critical phenomenon: analogous to human distraction, CLIP diverts significant attention resources from target regions to irrelevant tokens. Our analysis reveals that these tokens arise from dimension-specific over-activation; filtering them enhances CLIP's dense prediction performance. Consequently, we propose ReFocusing CLIP (RF-CLIP), a training-free approach that emulates human distraction-refocusing behavior to redirect attention from distraction tokens back to target regions, thereby refining CLIP's multimodal alignment granularity.

However, letting VLA directly predict high-dimensional visual states can distribute model capacity and incur prohibitive training cost, while compressing visual states into more compact supervisory signals inevitably incurs information bottlenecks. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from poor comprehension and reasoning capabilities due to the neglect of language supervision. This paper introduces Mantis, a novel framework featuring a Disentangled Visual Foresight (DVF) to tackle these issues. Specifically, Mantis decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone with the combination of meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head. With the current visual state provided to the DiT via a residual connection, a simple next-state prediction objective enables the meta queries to automatically capture the latent actions that delineate the visual trajectory, and hence boost the learning of explicit actions. The disentanglement reduces the burden of the VLA backbone, enabling it to maintain comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision. Empirically, pretrained on human manipulation videos, robot demonstrations, and image-text pairs, Mantis achieves a 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing powerful baselines while exhibiting high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show that Mantis outperforms $\u03c0_{0.5}$, a leading open-source VLA model, particularly in instruction-following capability, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability.

However, due to the discrepancies between public datasets and real-world data, most existing VI-ReID algorithms struggle in real-life applications. To address this, we take the initiative to investigate Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (UDA-VI-ReID), aiming to transfer the knowledge learned from the public data to real-world data without compromising accuracy and requiring the annotation of new samples. Specifically, we first analyze two basic challenges in UDA-VI-ReID, i.e., inter-domain modality discrepancies and intra-domain modality discrepancies. Then, we design a novel two-stage model, i.e., Domain-Shared Learning and Gradual Alignment (DSLGA), to handle these discrepancies. In the first pre-training stage, DSLGA introduces a Domain-Shared Learning Strategy (DSLS) to mitigate ineffective pre-training caused by inter-domain modality discrepancies via exploiting shared information between the source and target domains.

In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework.

To rigorously quantify this failure, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Deception Assessment (MIDA), and present a novel multimodal dataset providing synchronized video and text with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 12 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to effectively ground language in multimodal social cues and lack the ability to model what others know, believe, or intend, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems. To take a step forward, we design a Social Chain-of-Thought (SoCoT) reasoning pipeline and a Dynamic Social Epistemic Memory (DSEM) module. Our framework yields performance improvement on this challenging task, demonstrating a promising new path toward building MLLMs capable of genuine human-like social reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u6b3a\u9a97\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1(MIDA)\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8612\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdbMLLMs\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u793e\u4ea4\u6b3a\u9a97\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7fGPT-4o\u7b49\u5f3a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5047\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86SoCoT\u63a8\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\u548cDSEM\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\uff1a\u5728\u590d\u6742\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d'\u8bfb\u61c2\u623f\u95f4'\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b3a\u9a97\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165MIDA\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5305\u542b\u540c\u6b65\u89c6\u9891\u6587\u672c\u53ca\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f3012\u4e2aMLLMs\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86Social Chain-of-Thought\u63a8\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\u548cDynamic Social Epistemic Memory\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1a\u5373\u4f7f\u5f3a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5047\u3002\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u793e\u4ea4\u7ebf\u7d22\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5efa\u6a21\u4ed6\u4eba\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6216\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5177\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SoCoT\u548cDSEM\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5e26\u6765\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u771f\u6b63\u7c7b\u4eba\u793e\u4ea4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684MLLMs\u7684\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing methods typically connect parallel RGB and NIR branches to a shared backbone, which limits the comprehensive extraction of distinctive modality-specific features and fails to address the issue of object drift, especially in the presence of unreliable inputs. In this paper, we propose SwiTrack, a novel state-switching framework that redefines CMOT through the deployment of three specialized streams. Specifically, RGB frames are processed by the visual encoder, while NIR frames undergo refinement via a NIR gated adapter coupled with the visual encoder to progressively calibrate shared latent space features, thereby yielding more robust cross-modal representations. For invalid modalities, a consistency trajectory prediction module leverages spatio-temporal cues to estimate target movement, ensuring robust tracking and mitigating drift. Additionally, we incorporate dynamic template reconstruction to iteratively update template features and employ a similarity alignment loss to reinforce feature consistency. Experimental results on the latest benchmarks demonstrate that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance, boosting precision rate and success rate gains by 7.2\\% and 4.3\\%, respectively, while maintaining real-time tracking at 65 frames per second.

Motivated by this, and considering various benefits of mobile device deployment (data privacy, operating without internet connectivity, and potentially faster responses), this paper develops Texture3dgs, an optimized mapping of 3DGS for a mobile GPU. A critical challenge in this area turns out to be optimizing for the two-dimensional (2D) texture cache, which needs to be exploited for faster executions on mobile GPUs. As a sorting method dominates the computations in 3DGS on mobile platforms, the core of Texture3dgs is a novel sorting algorithm where the processing, data movement, and placement are highly optimized for 2D memory. The properties of this algorithm are analyzed in view of a cost model for the texture cache. In addition, we accelerate other steps of the 3DGS algorithm through improved variable layout design and other optimizations. End-to-end evaluation shows that Texture3dgs delivers up to 4.1$\\times$ and 1.7$\\times$ speedup for the sorting and overall 3D scene reconstruction, respectively -- while also reducing memory usage by up to 1.6$\\times$ -- demonstrating the effectiveness of our design for efficient mobile 3D scene reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Texture3dgs\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u79fb\u52a8GPU\u4f18\u5316\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85(3DGS)\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u8282\u7701\u3002", "motivation": "\u8003\u8651\u5230\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff08\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u7f51\u7edc\u8fde\u63a5\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u66f4\u5feb\uff09\uff0c\u5c063DGS\u9ad8\u6548\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u79fb\u52a8GPU\u4e0a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf92D\u7eb9\u7406\u7f13\u5b58\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9488\u5bf92D\u5185\u5b58\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u53d8\u91cf\u5e03\u5c40\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bd\u5176\u4ed6\u4f18\u5316\u63aa\u65bd\u6765\u52a0\u901f3DGS\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5404\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cTexture3dgs\u5728\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e864.1\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u6574\u4f533D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e861.7\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c11\u4e861.6\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u65483D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u79fb\u52a8\u7aef3D\u91cd\u5efa\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although Vision Foundation Models demonstrate strong generalization across diverse downstream tasks, their representations are typically downsampled by 14x/16x (e.g., ViT), which limits their direct use in pixel-level applications. Existing feature upsampling approaches depend on dataset-specific retraining or heavy implicit optimization, restricting scalability and generalization. Upsample Anything addresses these issues through a simple per-image optimization that learns an anisotropic Gaussian kernel combining spatial and range cues, effectively bridging Gaussian Splatting and Joint Bilateral Upsampling. The learned kernel acts as a universal, edge-aware operator that transfers seamlessly across architectures and modalities, enabling precise high-resolution reconstruction of features, depth, or probability maps. It runs in only $\\approx0.419 \\text{s}$ per 224x224 image and achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and both depth and probability map upsampling.", "AI": {"tldr": "Upsample Anything\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5c06\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7279\u5f81\u6062\u590d\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u6838\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u8303\u56f4\u7ebf\u7d22\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fb9\u7f18\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u4e0b\u91c7\u683714x/16x\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u7e41\u91cd\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6bcf\u56fe\u50cf\u4f18\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u6838\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u8303\u56f4\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8fde\u63a5\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u548c\u8054\u5408\u53cc\u8fb9\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u3002\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6838\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u611f\u77e5\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u65e0\u7f1d\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728224x224\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u4ec5\u9700\u7ea60.419\u79d2\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ee5\u53ca\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u6982\u7387\u56fe\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Upsample Anything\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

This view implies SAE features are thematic components rather than steerable directions. Based on this, we introduce SAE-TM, a topic modeling framework that: (1) trains an SAE to learn reusable topic atoms, (2) interprets them as word distributions on downstream data, and (3) merges them into any number of topics without retraining. SAE-TM yields more coherent topics than strong baselines on text and image datasets while maintaining diversity. Finally, we analyze thematic structure in image datasets and trace topic changes over time in Japanese woodblock prints.

In contrast to previous approaches that rely on baking 2D multi-view images synthesized by geometry-conditioned Multi-View Diffusion models (MVDs), NaTex avoids several inherent limitations of the MVD pipeline. These include difficulties in handling occluded regions that require inpainting, achieving precise mesh-texture alignment along boundaries, and maintaining cross-view consistency and coherence in both content and color intensity. NaTex features a novel paradigm that addresses the aforementioned issues by viewing texture as a dense color point cloud. Driven by this idea, we propose latent color diffusion, which comprises a geometry-awared color point cloud VAE and a multi-control diffusion transformer (DiT), entirely trained from scratch using 3D data, for texture reconstruction and generation. To enable precise alignment, we introduce native geometry control that conditions the DiT on direct 3D spatial information via positional embeddings and geometry latents. We co-design the VAE-DiT architecture, where the geometry latents are extracted via a dedicated geometry branch tightly coupled with the color VAE, providing fine-grained surface guidance that maintains strong correspondence with the texture. With these designs, NaTex demonstrates strong performance, significantly outperforming previous methods in texture coherence and alignment.

Recent hybrid approaches, which couple domain priors with modern deep neural architectures, have achieved strong performance but incur high computational cost, limiting their practicality in real-time scenarios. In this work, we propose WWE-UIE, a compact and efficient enhancement network that integrates three interpretable priors. First, adaptive white balance alleviates the strong wavelength-dependent color attenuation, particularly the dominance of blue-green tones. Second, a wavelet-based enhancement block (WEB) performs multi-band decomposition, enabling the network to capture both global structures and fine textures, which are critical for underwater restoration. Third, a gradient-aware module (SGFB) leverages Sobel operators with learnable gating to explicitly preserve edge structures degraded by scattering. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WWE-UIE achieves competitive restoration quality with substantially fewer parameters and FLOPs, enabling real-time inference on resource-limited platforms.

This article introduces ChangeDINO, an end-to-end multiscale Siamese framework for optical building change detection. The model fuses a lightweight backbone stream with features transferred from a frozen DINOv3, yielding semantic- and context-rich pyramids even on small datasets. A spatial-spectral differential transformer decoder then exploits multi-scale absolute differences as change priors to highlight true building changes and suppress irrelevant responses. Finally, a learnable morphology module refines the upsampled logits to recover clean boundaries. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that ChangeDINO consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in IoU and F1, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.

However, existing FSR methods are limited by fixed up-sampling scales and sensitivity to input size variations. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an Arbitrary-Resolution and Arbitrary-Scale FSR method with implicit representation networks (ARASFSR), featuring three novel designs. First, ARASFSR employs 2D deep features, local relative coordinates, and up-sampling scale ratios to predict RGB values for each target pixel, allowing super-resolution at any up-sampling scale.

Besides grappling with the complexity of data annotation and ensuring temporal consistency, it also confronts the scarcity of relevant data and the limitations imposed by the effective range of many technologies. This research substantiates that, in aerial positioning tasks, both the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and temporal consistency (TC) metrics are of paramount importance. It is demonstrated that fully labeled data is not the optimal choice, as selecting only key data lacks the enhancement in TC, leading to failures. Hence, a teacher-student architecture, coupled with key frame selection and key frame updating algorithms, is proposed. This framework successfully performs weakly supervised learning and TC knowledge distillation, overcoming the deficiencies of traditional TC training in aerial tasks. The experimental results reveal that our method utilizing merely 30\\% of labeled data, concurrently elevates mIoU and temporal consistency ensuring stable localization of terrain objects.

However, in real-world scenarios, the acquisition of strictly aligned RGB-D is hindered by inherent hardware limitations (e.g., physically separate RGB-D sensors) and unavoidable calibration drift induced by mechanical vibrations or temperature variations. Consequently, existing approaches often suffer inevitable performance degradation when applied to misaligned real-world scenes. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Order Matching Network (MOMNet), a novel alignment-free framework that adaptively retrieves and selects the most relevant information from misaligned RGB. Specifically, our method begins with a multi-order matching mechanism, which jointly performs zero-order, first-order, and second-order matching to comprehensively identify RGB information consistent with depth across multi-order feature spaces. To effectively integrate the retrieved RGB and depth, we further introduce a multi-order aggregation composed of multiple structure detectors.

This paper proposes a new model, DetailSemNet, for OSV. Unlike previous methods that rely on holistic features for pair comparisons, our approach underscores the significance of fine-grained differences for robust OSV. We propose to match local structures between two signature images, significantly boosting verification accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that without specific architectural modifications, transformer-based backbones might naturally obscure local details, adversely impacting OSV performance. To address this, we introduce a Detail Semantics Integrator, leveraging feature disentanglement and re-entanglement. This integrator is specifically designed to enhance intricate details while simultaneously expanding discriminative semantics, thereby augmenting the efficacy of local structural matching. We evaluate our method against leading benchmarks in offline signature verification. Our model consistently outperforms recent methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with clear margins.

Most Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based CZSL methods focus on disentangling attributes and objects by leveraging the global semantic representation obtained from the image encoder. However, this representation has limited representational capacity and do not allow for complete disentanglement of the two. To this end, we propose CAMS, which aims to extract semantic features from visual features and perform semantic disentanglement in multidimensional spaces, thereby improving generalization over unseen attribute-object compositions. Specifically, CAMS designs a Gated Cross-Attention that captures fine-grained semantic features from the high-level image encoding blocks of CLIP through a set of latent units, while adaptively suppressing background and other irrelevant information. Subsequently, it conducts Multi-Space Disentanglement to achieve disentanglement of attribute and object semantics.

Yet, most existing methods suffer from depth estimates that are inconsistent between overlapping images. Addressing this limitation, we propose a novel geometry-guided method for calibrated, time-synchronized multi-camera rigs that predicts dense, metric, and cross-view-consistent depth. Given the intrinsic and relative orientation parameters, a first depth map is predicted per image and the so-derived 3D points from all images are projected onto a shared unit cylinder, establishing neighborhood relations across different images. This produces a 2D position map for every image, where each pixel is assigned its projected position on the cylinder. Based on these position maps, we apply an explicit, non-learned spatial attention that aggregates features among pixels across images according to their distances on the cylinder, to predict a final depth map per image.

Deep learning models often struggle with occlusions, long-range dependencies, and capturing the fine-scale geometry of rare structures. This work addresses these challenges by introducing graph-based segmentation approaches that enhance spatial and semantic understanding in surgical scene analyses.\n  Methods: We propose two segmentation models integrating Vision Transformer (ViT) feature encoders with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to explicitly model spatial relationships between anatomical regions. (1) A static k Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) graph with a Graph Convolutional Network with Initial Residual and Identity Mapping (GCNII) enables stable long-range information propagation. (2) A dynamic Differentiable Graph Generator (DGG) with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) supports adaptive topology learning. Both models are evaluated on the Endoscapes-Seg50 and CholecSeg8k benchmarks.\n  Results: The proposed approaches achieve up to 7-8% improvement in Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and 6% improvement in Mean Dice (mDice) scores over state-of-the-art baselines. It produces anatomically coherent predictions, particularly on thin, rare and safety-critical structures.\n  Conclusion: The proposed graph-based segmentation methods enhance both performance and anatomical consistency in surgical scene segmentation. By combining ViT-based global context with graph-based relational reasoning, the models improve interpretability and reliability, paving the way for safer laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery through a precise identification of critical anatomical features.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408Vision Transformer\u548cGraph Neural Networks\u7684\u56fe\u57fa\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u8179\u8154\u955c\u80c6\u56ca\u5207\u9664\u672f\u4e2d\u809d\u80c6\u56ca\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u906e\u6321\u3001\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u906e\u6321\u3001\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u7f55\u89c1\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff1a1\uff09\u9759\u6001k-NN\u56fe\u4e0eGCNII\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\uff1b2\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4e0eGAT\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u62d3\u6251\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u5728Endoscapes-Seg50\u548cCholecSeg8k\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728mIoU\u548cmDice\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u53477-8%\u548c6%\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7ec6\u8584\u3001\u7f55\u89c1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u4ea7\u751f\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56fe\u57fa\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u89e3\u5256\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408ViT\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u56fe\u57fa\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u8179\u8154\u955c\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u624b\u672f\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

In this paper, we argue that the references from support images may not be essential, the key to the support role is to provide unbiased meta guidance for both trained and untrained classes. We then introduce a Language-Driven Attribute Generalization (LDAG) architecture to utilize inherent target property language descriptions to build robust support strategy. Specifically, to obtain an unbiased support representation, we design a Multi-attribute Enhancement (MaE) module, which produces multiple detailed attribute descriptions of the target class through Large Language Models (LLMs), and then builds refined visual-text prior guidance utilizing multi-modal matching. Meanwhile, due to text-vision modal shift, attribute text struggles to promote visual feature representation, we design a Multi-modal Attribute Alignment (MaA) to achieve cross-modal interaction between attribute texts and visual feature.

Despite the growing number of litter detection datasets, the problem of monitoring overflowing waste containers, particularly from images captured by garbage trucks, has received little attention. While existing datasets are valuable, they often lack annotations for specific container tracking or are captured in static, decontextualized environments, limiting their utility for real-world logistics. To address this gap, we present StreetView-Waste, a comprehensive dataset of urban scenes featuring litter and waste containers. The dataset supports three key evaluation tasks: (1) waste container detection, (2) waste container tracking, and (3) waste overflow segmentation. Alongside the dataset, we provide baselines for each task by benchmarking state-of-the-art models in object detection, tracking, and segmentation. Additionally, we enhance baseline performance by proposing two complementary strategies: a heuristic-based method for improved waste container tracking and a model-agnostic framework that leverages geometric priors to refine litter segmentation. Our experimental results show that while fine-tuned object detectors achieve reasonable performance in detecting waste containers, baseline tracking methods struggle to accurately estimate their number; however, our proposed heuristics reduce the mean absolute counting error by 79.6%. Similarly, while segmenting amorphous litter is challenging, our geometry-aware strategy improves segmentation mAP@0.5 by 27% on lightweight models, demonstrating the value of multimodal inputs for this task.

Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget. Experiments show that VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "VLA-Pruner\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u4ee4\u724c\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4ee4\u724c\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee4\u724c\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u663e\u8457\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cc\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u6027\uff08\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4f4e\u5c42\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u88ab\u4e22\u5f03\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6807\u51c6\uff1a\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u586b\u5145\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7528\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u89e3\u7801\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u4f5c\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6807\u51c6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53cc\u7ea7\u4ee4\u724c\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u4fdd\u7559\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u96c6\u5408\u3002", "result": "VLA-Pruner\u5728\u591a\u79cdVLA\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "VLA-Pruner\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cc\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u6027\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u526a\u679d\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5177\u8eabAI\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Although general video prediction models have achieved remarkable performance in standard scenarios, occlusion is still an inherent challenge in video prediction. We hypothesize that providing explicit information about motion (via point-flow) and geometric structure (via depth-maps) will enable video prediction models to perform better in situations with occlusion and the background motion. To investigate this, we present the first systematic study dedicated to occluded video prediction. We use a standard multi-object latent transformer architecture to predict future frames, but modify this to incorporate information from depth and point-flow. We evaluate this model in a controlled setting on both synthetic and real-world datasets with not only appearance-based metrics but also Wasserstein distances on object masks, which can effectively measure the motion distribution of the prediction. We find that when the prediction model is assisted with point flow and depth, it performs better in occluded scenarios and predicts more accurate background motion compared to models without the help of these modalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u70b9\u6d41\uff08point-flow\uff09\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\uff08depth-maps\uff09\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u906e\u6321\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u8fd0\u52a8\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5185\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5047\u8bbe\u63d0\u4f9b\u660e\u786e\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u70b9\u6d41\uff09\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u5e2e\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u906e\u6321\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u8fd0\u52a8\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u591a\u5bf9\u8c61\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u672a\u6765\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u4fee\u6539\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u4ee5\u6574\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u70b9\u6d41\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u53d7\u63a7\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5916\u89c2\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u8c61\u63a9\u7801\u7684Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u6765\u6709\u6548\u6d4b\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u4ee5\u70b9\u6d41\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u5f15\u5165\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u80cc\u666f\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

However, current methods rely heavily on large, high-quality microscope image datasets, which are difficult and costly to acquire due to the complexity of microrobot fabrication and the labour-intensive labelling. Digital twin systems offer a promising path for sim-to-real data augmentation, yet existing techniques struggle to replicate complex optical microscopy phenomena, such as diffraction artifacts and depth-dependent imaging.This work proposes a novel physics-informed deep generative learning framework that, for the first time, integrates wave optics-based physical rendering and depth alignment into a generative adversarial network (GAN), to synthesise high-fidelity microscope images for microrobot pose estimation efficiently. Our method improves the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 35.6% compared to purely AI-driven methods, while maintaining real-time rendering speeds (0.022 s/frame).The pose estimator (CNN backbone) trained on our synthetic data achieves 93.9%/91.9% (pitch/roll) accuracy, just 5.0%/5.4% (pitch/roll) below that of an estimator trained exclusively on real data.

The dynamic changes in contrast in different tissues help to highlight the tumor in post-contrast images.

However, registering CMCs to the target scene layout presents a challenging task. While manual registration with specialized tools is inefficient and costly, automatic registration with visual localization may yield poor results when visual ambiguity exists. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel solution for jointly mapping an indoor scene and registering CMCs to the scene layout. Our approach involves equipping a mobile agent with a head-mounted RGB-D camera to traverse the entire scene once and synchronize CMCs to capture this mobile agent. The egocentric videos generate world-coordinate agent trajectories and the scene layout, while the videos of CMCs provide pseudo-scale agent trajectories and CMC relative poses. By correlating all the trajectories with their corresponding timestamps, the CMC relative poses can be aligned to the world-coordinate scene layout. Based on this initialization, a factor graph is customized to enable the joint optimization of ego-camera poses, scene layout, and CMC poses. We also develop a new dataset, setting the first benchmark for collaborative scene mapping and CMC registration (https://sites.google.com/view/yowo/home).

Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) trains two neural networks in contrastive manner to align their image and text embeddings in a shared latent space. Recent results evaluating CLIP on negated or paraphrased text have shown mixed performance because negation changes meaning radically with minimal lexical changes, while paraphrasing can create very different textual expressions with the same intended meaning. This poses a significant challenge for improving the evaluation results and alignment of vision-language models. To address this challenge, this paper evaluates the combination of paraphrasing and negation, proposes a new CLIP contrastive loss function accounting for both paraphrasing and negation, and applies LLM-generated training triples consisting of original, paraphrased and negated textual captions to CLIP-like training models. The approach, called SemCLIP, is shown to move paraphrased captions towards the original image embeddings while pushing negated captions further away in embedding space. Empirically, SemCLIP is shown to be capable of preserving CLIP's performance while increasing considerably the distances to negated captions. On the CC-Neg benchmark using an original over negation image-retrieval accuracy metric, SemCLIP improves accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1%. Although results are mixed when compared with CLIP on the Sugarcrepe++ benchmark, SemCLIP's performance is generally better than the models trained with negated captions. This robustness to negation extends to downstream zero-shot classification tasks where SemCLIP pre-trained on Sugarcrepe++ performs better than CLIP on all tested downstream tasks. These results indicate that SemCLIP can achieve significant robustness to semantic transformations.", "AI": {"tldr": "SemCLIP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684CLIP\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u91ca\u4e49\u548c\u5426\u5b9a\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff08\u539f\u59cb\u3001\u91ca\u4e49\u548c\u5426\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff09\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5426\u5b9a\u548c\u91ca\u4e49\u6587\u672c\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5426\u5b9a\u4f1a\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u8bcd\u6c47\u53d8\u5316\u5f7b\u5e95\u6539\u53d8\u542b\u4e49\uff0c\u800c\u91ca\u4e49\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u540c\u4f46\u542b\u4e49\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u8fd9\u7ed9\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684CLIP\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u91ca\u4e49\u548c\u5426\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b\u5e94\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff08\u539f\u59cb\u3001\u91ca\u4e49\u548c\u5426\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff09\u8fdb\u884cCLIP\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u4f7f\u91ca\u4e49\u63cf\u8ff0\u9760\u8fd1\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u5426\u5b9a\u63cf\u8ff0\u63a8\u79bb\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728CC-Neg\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece68.1%\u63d0\u5347\u81f378.1%\uff1b\u5728Sugarcrepe++\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5426\u5b9a\u63cf\u8ff0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSemCLIP\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8eCLIP\u3002", "conclusion": "SemCLIP\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301CLIP\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\u4e0e\u5426\u5b9a\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Despite considerable progress in multi-camera tracking algorithms, tracking gymnasts presents unique challenges: (i) due to space restrictions, only a limited number of cameras can be installed in the gymnastics stadium; and (ii) due to variations in lighting, background, uniforms, and occlusions, multi-camera gymnast detection may fail in certain views and only provide valid detections from two opposing views. These factors complicate the accurate determination of a gymnast's 3D trajectory using conventional multi-camera triangulation. To alleviate this issue, we incorporate gymnastics domain knowledge into our tracking solution. Given that a gymnast's 3D center typically lies within a predefined vertical plane during \\revised{much of their} performance, we can apply a ray-plane intersection to generate coplanar 3D trajectory candidates for opposing-view detections. More specifically, we propose a novel cascaded data association (DA) paradigm that employs triangulation to generate 3D trajectory candidates when cross-view detections are sufficient, and resort to the ray-plane intersection when they are insufficient.

This problem is compounded by the accelerated release cycle of novel generative models, which renders traditional detection approaches (reliant on periodic retraining) computationally infeasible and operationally impractical.\n  This work proposes a novel two-stage detection framework designed to address the generalization challenge inherent in synthetic image detection. The first stage employs a vision deep learning model trained via supervised contrastive learning to extract discriminative embeddings from input imagery. Critically, this model was trained on a strategically partitioned subset of available generators, with specific architectures withheld from training to rigorously ablate cross-generator generalization capabilities. The second stage utilizes a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier operating on the learned embedding space, trained in a few-shot learning paradigm incorporating limited samples from previously unseen test generators.\n  With merely 150 images per class in the few-shot learning regime, which are easily obtainable from current generation models, the proposed framework achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.3\\%, representing a 5.2 percentage point improvement over existing approaches . For the source attribution task, the proposed approach obtains improvements of of 14.70\\% and 4.27\\% in AUC and OSCR respectively on an open set classification context, marking a significant advancement toward robust, scalable forensic attribution systems capable of adapting to the evolving generative AI landscape without requiring exhaustive retraining protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u53d6\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408k-NN\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6765\u6e90\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u5bfc\u81f4\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u96be\u4ee5\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5185\u5bb9\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b9a\u671f\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5e03\u5468\u671f\u4e0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u90e8\u5206\u751f\u6210\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u4ee5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8de8\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528k-NN\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6bcf\u7c7b150\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523091.3%\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u53475.2\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b\u5728\u6765\u6e90\u5f52\u56e0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cAUC\u548cOSCR\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534714.70%\u548c4.27%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u65ad\u6f14\u8fdb\u7684\u751f\u6210AI\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u53d6\u8bc1\u5f52\u56e0\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8fdb\u884c\u8be6\u5c3d\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

In this work, we extend the Earth Observation Gaussian Splatting (EOGS) framework to propose EOGS++, a novel method tailored for satellite imagery that directly operates on raw high-resolution panchromatic data without requiring external preprocessing. Furthermore, leveraging optical flow techniques we embed bundle adjustment directly within the training process, avoiding reliance on external optimization tools while improving camera pose estimation. We also introduce several improvements to the original implementation, including early stopping and TSDF post-processing, all contributing to sharper reconstructions and better geometric accuracy.

However, progressive multi-scale generation incurs substantial memory overhead due to cumulative KV caching, limiting practical deployment.\n  We observe a scale-depth asymmetric dependency in VAR: early scales exhibit extreme sensitivity to network depth, while later scales remain robust to depth reduction. Inspired by this, we propose VARiant: by equidistant sampling, we select multiple subnets ranging from 16 to 2 layers from the original 30-layer VAR-d30 network. Early scales are processed by the full network, while later scales utilize subnet. Subnet and the full network share weights, enabling flexible depth adjustment within a single model.\n  However, weight sharing between subnet and the entire network can lead to optimization conflicts. To address this, we propose a progressive training strategy that breaks through the Pareto frontier of generation quality for both subnets and the full network under fixed-ratio training, achieving joint optimality.\n  Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that, compared to the pretrained VAR-d30 (FID 1.95), VARiant-d16 and VARiant-d8 achieve nearly equivalent quality (FID 2.05/2.12) while reducing memory consumption by 40-65%. VARiant-d2 achieves 3.5 times speedup and 80% memory reduction at moderate quality cost (FID 2.97).

Point maps encode explicit 3D coordinates on a structured 2D grid, preserving global 3D geometry while remaining compatible with the input format of 2D foundation models. To transfer rich 2D priors into POMA-3D, a view-to-scene alignment strategy is designed. Moreover, as point maps are view-dependent with respect to a canonical space, we introduce POMA-JEPA, a joint embedding-predictive architecture that enforces geometrically consistent point map features across multiple views. Additionally, we introduce ScenePoint, a point map dataset constructed from 6.5K room-level RGB-D scenes and 1M 2D image scenes to facilitate large-scale POMA-3D pretraining. Experiments show that POMA-3D serves as a strong backbone for both specialist and generalist 3D understanding. It benefits diverse tasks, including 3D question answering, embodied navigation, scene retrieval, and embodied localization, all achieved using only geometric inputs (i.e., 3D coordinates). Overall, our POMA-3D explores a point map way to 3D scene understanding, addressing the scarcity of pretrained priors and limited data in 3D representation learning.

We introduce Erase to Retain, a controllable unlearning framework for medical image segmentation that achieves targeted forgetting without full retraining. Our method uses a teacher-student distillation paradigm with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrained subspace updates, enabling the student network to erase lesion-specific or class-specific representations in low-rank decoder spaces while preserving global anatomical understanding. During the strong unlearning phase, LoRA modules are adversarially optimized to contradict the teacher's confident predictions on a designated forget subset, enforcing semantic removal. This is followed by a gentle restoration phase that recovers generalization on retained data through head-only supervised refinement.\n  For ISIC segmentation, the student reduces forget-set IoU from 0.875 to 0.509 while maintaining competitive performance on the retain and validation splits (0.647 to 0.677 IoU). On the cross-domain CHASE dataset, Erase to Retain consistently lowers forget-set IoU while preserving utility on retain and validation sets. For ISIC classification, our method decreases accuracy on the forget subset from 87.0 percent to 64.1 percent while improving retain accuracy from 83.9 percent to 90.6 percent.\n  These results demonstrate that LoRA-based subspace unlearning provides a practical pathway toward responsible, controllable, and reversible unlearning in medical image analysis, enabling models to forget sensitive samples or structures while preserving performance where it matters most.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faErase to Retain\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u84b8\u998f\u548cLoRA\u7ea6\u675f\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u5206\u5272\u7f51\u7edc\u9700\u8981\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u6ee1\u8db3\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u89c4\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6301\u7eed\u4fee\u8ba2\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u84b8\u998f\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LoRA\u7ea6\u675f\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u9057\u5fd8\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u6e29\u548c\u6062\u590d\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "result": "\u5728ISIC\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6IoU\u4ece0.875\u964d\u81f30.509\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u96c6\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff1b\u5728CHASE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u540c\u6837\u6709\u6548\uff1bISIC\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece87.0%\u964d\u81f364.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eLoRA\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u9057\u5fd8\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u53ef\u9006\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Processing long videos demands both an efficient model architecture and an effective mechanism for handling extended temporal contexts. To this end, TimeViper adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone that combines the efficiency of state-space models with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TimeViper competes with state-of-the-art models while extending frame numbers.

Interactive Video Object Segmentation (iVOS) models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) provide prompt-based flexibility beyond methods with predefined categories, but face challenges in surgical scenarios due to the domain gap and limited long-term tracking. To address these limitations, we construct SA-SV, the largest surgical iVOS benchmark with instance-level spatio-temporal annotations (masklets) spanning eight procedure types (61k frames, 1.6k masklets), enabling comprehensive development and evaluation for long-term tracking and zero-shot generalization. Building on SA-SV, we propose SAM2S, a foundation model enhancing \\textbf{SAM2} for \\textbf{S}urgical iVOS through: (1) DiveMem, a trainable diverse memory mechanism for robust long-term tracking; (2) temporal semantic learning for instrument understanding; and (3) ambiguity-resilient learning to mitigate annotation inconsistencies across multi-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning on SA-SV enables substantial performance gains, with SAM2 improving by 12.99 average $\\mathcal{J}$\\&$\\mathcal{F}$ over vanilla SAM2. SAM2S further advances performance to 80.42 average $\\mathcal{J}$\\&$\\mathcal{F}$, surpassing vanilla and fine-tuned SAM2 by 17.10 and 4.11 points respectively, while maintaining 68 FPS real-time inference and strong zero-shot generalization.

However, real-world scenarios introduce the challenge of long-tailed distributions, where numerous categories contain only a few instances. This inherent class imbalance biases detection models towards the more frequent classes, degrading performance on rare categories. In this paper, we tackle the problem of long-tailed 2D object detection using the LVISv1 dataset, which consists of 1,203 categories and 164,000 images. We employ a two-stage Faster R-CNN architecture and propose enhancements to the Balanced Group Softmax (BAGS) framework to mitigate class imbalance. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 24.5%, surpassing the previous benchmark of 24.0%.\n  Additionally, we hypothesize that tail class features may form smaller, denser clusters within the feature space of head classes, making classification challenging for regression-based classifiers. To address this issue, we explore metric learning to produce feature embeddings that are both well-separated across classes and tightly clustered within each class.

Both generate structured reports with CoT reasoning, storing complete analytical processes for experiential learning. (2) Dichotomy-Based Multi-Expert Agent Inference retrieves similar cases via RAG and integrates multimodal reports with expert predictions through progressive interval refinement.

To address these issues, we propose a novel framework with a primary 3DHS branch and an auxiliary discrimination branch. Specifically, to alleviate the multi-hierarchy conflicts, we propose a late-decoupled 3DHS framework which employs multiple decoders with the coarse-to-fine hierarchical guidance and consistency. The late-decoupled architecture can mitigate the underfitting and overfitting conflicts among multiple hierarchies and can also constrain the class imbalance problem in each individual hierarchy. Moreover, we introduce a 3DHS-oriented semantic prototype based bi-branch supervision mechanism, which additionally learns class-wise discriminative point cloud features and performs mutual supervision between the auxiliary and 3DHS branches, to enhance the class-imbalance segmentation.

To address this challenge, we introduce a novel teacher-guided pruning framework that tightly integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) with importance score estimation. Unlike prior approaches that apply KD as a post-pruning recovery step, our method leverages gradient signals informed by the teacher during importance score calculation to identify and retain parameters most critical for both task performance and knowledge transfer. Our method facilitates a one-shot global pruning strategy that efficiently eliminates redundant weights while preserving essential representations. After pruning, we employ sparsity-aware retraining with and without KD to recover accuracy without reactivating pruned connections. Comprehensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high sparsity levels with minimal performance degradation. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as EPG and EPSD at high sparsity levels, while offering a more computationally efficient alternative to iterative pruning schemes like COLT.

In this work, we conduct a critical analysis of Cambrian-S across both these fronts. First, we introduce a simple baseline, NoSense, which discards almost all temporal structure and uses only a bag-of-words SigLIP model, yet near-perfectly solves VSR, achieving 95% accuracy even on 4-hour videos. This shows benchmarks like VSR can be nearly solved without spatial cognition, world modeling or spatial supersensing. Second, we hypothesize that the tailored inference methods proposed by Cambrian-S likely exploit shortcut heuristics in the benchmark. We illustrate this with a simple sanity check on the VSC benchmark, called VSC-Repeat: We concatenate each video with itself 1-5 times, which does not change the number of unique objects. However, this simple perturbation entirely collapses the mean relative accuracy of Cambrian-S from 42% to 0%. A system that performs spatial supersensing and integrates information across experiences should recognize views of the same scene and keep object-count predictions unchanged; instead, Cambrian-S inference algorithm relies largely on a shortcut in the VSC benchmark that rooms are never revisited. Taken together, our findings suggest that (i) current VSI-Super benchmarks do not yet reliably measure spatial supersensing, and (ii) predictive-sensing inference recipes used by Cambrian-S improve performance by inadvertently exploiting shortcuts rather than from robust spatial supersensing.

Although extensively studied, existing UV unwrapping methods frequently struggle with AI-generated meshes, which are typically noisy, bumpy, and poorly conditioned. These methods often produce highly fragmented charts and suboptimal boundaries, introducing artifacts and hindering downstream tasks. We introduce PartUV, a part-based UV unwrapping pipeline that generates significantly fewer, part-aligned charts while maintaining low distortion. Built on top of a recent learning-based part decomposition method PartField, PartUV combines high-level semantic part decomposition with novel geometric heuristics in a top-down recursive framework. It ensures each chart's distortion remains below a user-specified threshold while minimizing the total number of charts. The pipeline integrates and extends parameterization and packing algorithms, incorporates dedicated handling of non-manifold and degenerate meshes, and is extensively parallelized for efficiency. Evaluated across four diverse datasets, including man-made, CAD, AI-generated, and Common Shapes, PartUV outperforms existing tools and recent neural methods in chart count and seam length, achieves comparable distortion, exhibits high success rates on challenging meshes, and enables new applications like part-specific multi-tiles packing.

Despite notable efforts in 4D generative modeling, existing methods exhibit fundamental limitations that impede their broader applicability, including temporal and geometric inconsistencies, perceptual artifacts, motion irregularities, high computational costs, and limited control over dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose TriDiff-4D, a novel 4D generative pipeline that employs diffusion-based triplane re-posing to produce high-quality, temporally coherent 4D avatars. Our model adopts an auto-regressive strategy to generate 4D sequences of arbitrary length, synthesizing each 3D frame with a single diffusion process. By explicitly learning 3D structure and motion priors from large-scale 3D and motion datasets, TriDiff-4D enables skeleton-driven 4D generation that excels in temporal consistency, motion accuracy, computational efficiency, and visual fidelity. Specifically, TriDiff-4D first generates a canonical 3D avatar and a corresponding motion sequence from a text prompt, then uses a second diffusion model to animate the avatar according to the motion sequence, supporting arbitrarily long 4D generation. Experimental results demonstrate that TriDiff-4D significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing generation time from hours to seconds by eliminating the optimization process, while substantially improving the generation of complex motions with high-fidelity appearance and accurate 3D geometry.", "AI": {"tldr": "TriDiff-4D\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u76844D\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u4e09\u5e73\u9762\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6280\u672f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u76844D\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9aa8\u67b6\u9a71\u52a8\u76844D\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u67094D\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u4f2a\u5f71\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6027\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u5bf9\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u53ef\u63a74D\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u610f\u957f\u5ea6\u76844D\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a3D\u5e27\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5408\u6210\u3002\u9996\u5148\u751f\u6210\u89c4\u83033D\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u548c\u5bf9\u5e94\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u4e3a\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u6dfb\u52a0\u52a8\u753b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eTriDiff-4D\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece\u5c0f\u65f6\u7ea7\u7f29\u77ed\u5230\u79d2\u7ea7\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u76843D\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "TriDiff-4D\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u76844D\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a74D\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, achieving simultaneous control over the 9D poses (location, size, and orientation) of multiple objects remains an open challenge. Despite recent progress, existing methods often suffer from limited controllability and degraded quality, falling short of comprehensive multi-object 9D pose control. To address these limitations, we propose SceneDesigner, a method for accurate and flexible multi-object 9-DoF pose manipulation. SceneDesigner incorporates a branched network to the pre-trained base model and leverages a new representation, CNOCS map, which encodes 9D pose information from the camera view. This representation exhibits strong geometric interpretation properties, leading to more efficient and stable training. To support training, we construct a new dataset, ObjectPose9D, which aggregates images from diverse sources along with 9D pose annotations. To further address data imbalance issues, particularly performance degradation on low-frequency poses, we introduce a two-stage training strategy with reinforcement learning, where the second stage fine-tunes the model using a reward-based objective on rebalanced data. At inference time, we propose Disentangled Object Sampling, a technique that mitigates insufficient object generation and concept confusion in complex multi-object scenes. Moreover, by integrating user-specific personalization weights, SceneDesigner enables customized pose control for reference subjects. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that SceneDesigner significantly outperforms existing approaches in both controllability and quality.

Motivated by video's inherent capacity to demonstrate physical-world information that is difficult to convey through language alone (e.g., imagine teaching someone to tie a tie using only text), we identify an underutilized opportunity to extend video as a new answer modality for Next-Event Prediction (NEP), formalized as Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP). While the established NEP task takes a video with a procedural or predictive question as input to predict the next event in text, VNEP requires dynamic video responses. This shift from telling to showing unlocks more intuitive and customized answers for procedural learning and creative exploration. However, this task remains challenging for existing models, as it demands an understanding of multimodal input, instruction-conditioned reasoning, and the generation of video with visual and semantic consistency. To address this, we introduce VANS, a model that leverages reinforcement learning to align a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) for VNEP. The core of VANS is our proposed Joint-GRPO that orchestrates the VLM and VDM to function as a unit. Driven by a shared reward on their respective output, it optimizes the VLM to produce captions that are both accurate and friendly to visualize, while guiding the VDM to generate videos that are faithful to these captions and the input visual context.

In this work, we propose a simple RL approach, which enables VLMs to automatically switch between fast and slow thinking modes depending on task difficulty. The approach consists of two stages: in the first stage, we label data as either requiring fast thinking or slow thinking based on the model output length, which is inspired by the observation that pre-trained VLMs typically produce answers of varying lengths for different types of questions; in the second stage, we train the model using GRPO along with the thinking mode labels to develop dual-mode thinking.

In this preliminary study, we introduce Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the first interleaved framework that enables co-evolving textual reasoning throughout the visual generation process. As visual content is progressively generating, textual reasoning is interleaved to both guide upcoming local regions and reflect on previously synthesized ones. This dynamic interplay produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs. To unveil the potential of this framework, we investigate three candidate strategies, zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our curated TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning (RL) via a customized TwiG-GRPO strategy, each offering unique insights into the dynamics of interleaved reasoning.

This dynamic feedback encourages both the generation of informative queries and the refinement of structured reasoning without relying on ground-truth or human judgments.

For this task, beyond a set of images, many prior state-of-the-art methods use accurate \"ground-truth\" camera poses and human poses as input to guide reconstruction at test-time. We show that pose-dependent reconstruction degrades results significantly if pose estimates are noisy. To overcome this, we introduce NoPo-Avatar, which reconstructs avatars solely from images, without any pose input. By removing the dependence of test-time reconstruction on human poses, NoPo-Avatar is not affected by noisy human pose estimates, making it more widely applicable. Experiments on challenging THuman2.0, XHuman, and HuGe100K data show that NoPo-Avatar outperforms existing baselines in practical settings (without ground-truth poses) and delivers comparable results in lab settings (with ground-truth poses).", "AI": {"tldr": "NoPo-Avatar\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u6216\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u53ef\u52a8\u753b3D\u4eba\u4f53\u5316\u8eab\u7684\u65e0\u59ff\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u7cbe\u786e\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5f80\u5f80\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNoPo-Avatar\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u5316\u8eab\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u5728THuman2.0\u3001XHuman\u548cHuGe100K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u771f\u5b9e\u59ff\u6001\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u771f\u5b9e\u59ff\u6001\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4e5f\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u76f8\u5f53\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "NoPo-Avatar\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9\u59ff\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863D\u4eba\u4f53\u5316\u8eab\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing distillation methods focus on synthesizing datasets that enable training randomly initialized models. In contrast, state-of-the-art vision approaches are increasingly building on large, pre-trained self-supervised models rather than training from scratch. In this paper, we investigate the problem of distilling datasets that enable us to optimally train linear probes on top of such large, pre-trained vision models. We introduce a method of dataset distillation for this task called Linear Gradient Matching that optimizes the synthetic images such that, when passed through a pre-trained feature extractor, they induce gradients in the linear classifier similar to those produced by the real data. Our method yields synthetic data that outperform all real-image baselines and, remarkably, generalize across pre-trained vision models, enabling us, for instance, to train a linear CLIP probe that performs competitively using a dataset distilled via a DINO backbone. Further, we show that our distilled datasets are exceptionally effective for fine-grained classification and provide a valuable tool for model interpretability, predicting, among other things, how similar two models' embedding spaces are under the platonic representation hypothesis or whether a model is sensitive to spurious correlations in adversarial datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4f7f\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u800c\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ebf\u6027\u68af\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5728\u6240\u6709\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u8de8\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7279\u522b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ebf\u6027\u68af\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Recent instruction-first systems translate grids into concise natural-language or DSL rules executed in generate-execute-select loops, yet we lack a principled account of how encodings shape model perception and how to separate instruction errors from execution errors. We hypothesize that modality imposes perceptual bottlenecks -- text flattens 2D structure into 1D tokens while images preserve layout but can introduce patch-size aliasing -- thereby shaping which grid features are reliably perceived. To test this, we isolate perception from reasoning across nine text and image modalities using a weighted set-disagreement metric and a two-stage reasoning pipeline, finding that structured text yields precise coordinates on sparse features, images capture 2D shapes yet are resolution-sensitive, and combining them improves execution (about 8 perception points; about 0.20 median similarity).

However, its performance on ultrasound images is significantly degraded due to domain disparities. This limitation raises two critical challenges: how to efficiently adapt SAM2 to ultrasound imaging while maintaining parameter efficiency, and how to deploy the adapted model effectively in resource-constrained clinical environments. To address these issues, we propose UniUltra for universal ultrasound segmentation. Specifically, we first introduce a novel context-edge hybrid adapter (CH-Adapter) that enhances fine-grained perception across diverse ultrasound imaging modalities while achieving parameter-efficient fine-tuning. To further improve clinical applicability, we develop a deep-supervised knowledge distillation (DSKD) technique that transfers knowledge from the large image encoder of the fine-tuned SAM2 to a super lightweight encoder, substantially reducing computational requirements without compromising performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniUltra outperforms state-of-the-arts with superior generalization capabilities. Notably, our framework achieves competitive performance using only 8.91% of SAM2's parameters during fine-tuning, and the final compressed model reduces the parameter count by 94.08% compared to the original SAM2, making it highly suitable for practical clinical deployment.

We introduce Footovision Play-by-Play Action Spotting in Soccer Dataset (FOOTPASS), the first benchmark for play-by-play action spotting over entire soccer matches in a multi-modal, multi-agent tactical context. It enables the development of methods for player-centric action spotting that exploit both outputs from computer-vision tasks (e.g., tracking, identification) and prior knowledge of soccer, including its tactical regularities over long time horizons, to generate reliable play-by-play data streams. These streams form an essential input for data-driven sports analytics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FOOTPASS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8db3\u7403\u6bd4\u8d5b\u5168\u573a\u6bd4\u8d5b\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u8db3\u7403\u6218\u672f\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9010\u573a\u6bd4\u8d5b\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8db3\u7403\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9010\u573a\u6bd4\u8d5b\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u80fd\u8f85\u52a9\u800c\u975e\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6218\u672f\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u6bd4\u8d5b\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u9010\u573a\u6bd4\u8d5b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4fc3\u4f7f\u5229\u7528\u6218\u672f\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u6765\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165FOOTPASS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6218\u672f\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u5f00\u53d1\u7403\u5458\u4e2d\u5fc3\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u8f93\u51fa\uff08\u5982\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\uff09\u548c\u8db3\u7403\u6218\u672f\u89c4\u5f8b\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u6574\u573a\u8db3\u7403\u6bd4\u8d5b\u7684\u9010\u573a\u6bd4\u8d5b\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4f53\u80b2\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "FOOTPASS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6218\u672f\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9010\u573a\u6bd4\u8d5b\u6570\u636e\u6d41\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4f53\u80b2\u5206\u6790\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Conventional robot cameras, with their small apertures and large depth of field, render both foreground obstacles and background objects in sharp focus, causing occluders to obscure critical scene information. This work establishes a formal connection between animal peering and synthetic aperture (SA) sensing from optical imaging. By having a robot execute a peering motion, its camera describes a wide synthetic aperture. Computational integration of the captured images synthesizes an image with an extremely shallow depth of field, effectively blurring out occluding elements while bringing the background into sharp focus. This efficient, wavelength-independent technique enables real-time, high-resolution perception across various spectral bands. We demonstrate that this approach not only restores basic scene understanding but also empowers advanced visual reasoning in large multimodal models, which fail with conventionally occluded imagery. Unlike feature-dependent multi-view 3D vision methods or active sensors like LiDAR, SA sensing via peering is robust to occlusion, computationally efficient, and immediately deployable on any mobile robot. This research bridges animal behavior and robotics, suggesting that peering motions for synthetic aperture sensing are a key to advanced scene understanding in complex, cluttered environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u7269\u6446\u5934\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5b54\u5f84\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6267\u884c\u6446\u5934\u8fd0\u52a8\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u5bbd\u5408\u6210\u5b54\u5f84\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u906e\u6321\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u76f8\u673a\u7531\u4e8e\u5c0f\u5b54\u5f84\u548c\u5927\u666f\u6df1\u5bfc\u81f4\u524d\u666f\u969c\u788d\u7269\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u7269\u4f53\u90fd\u6e05\u6670\u53ef\u89c1\uff0c\u906e\u6321\u7269\u4f1a\u63a9\u76d6\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u8ba9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6267\u884c\u6446\u5934\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u76f8\u673a\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u5f62\u6210\u5bbd\u5408\u6210\u5b54\u5f84\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u6574\u5408\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u5177\u6709\u6781\u6d45\u666f\u6df1\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u7cca\u906e\u6321\u5143\u7d20\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u80cc\u666f\u6e05\u6670\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u65f6\u6062\u590d\u57fa\u672c\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5bf9\u906e\u6321\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6446\u5934\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b9e\u73b0\u5408\u6210\u5b54\u5f84\u611f\u77e5\u662f\u5c06\u52a8\u7269\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7ea7\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Online Collaborative AI System (OL-CAIS) is a type of CPS that learn online in collaboration with humans to achieve a common goal, which makes it vulnerable to disruptive events that degrade performance. Decision-makers must therefore restore performance while limiting energy impact, creating a trade-off between resilience and greenness. This research addresses how to balance these two properties in OL-CAIS. It aims to model resilience for automatic state detection, develop agent-based policies that optimize the greenness-resilience trade-off, and understand catastrophic forgetting to maintain performance consistency. We model OL-CAIS behavior through three operational states: steady, disruptive, and final. To support recovery during disruptions, we introduce the GResilience framework, which provides recovery strategies through multi-objective optimization (one-agent), game-theoretic decision-making (two-agent), and reinforcement learning (RL-agent). We also design a measurement framework to quantify resilience and greenness. Empirical evaluation uses real and simulated experiments with a collaborative robot learning object classification from human demonstrations. Results show that the resilience model captures performance transitions during disruptions, and that GResilience policies improve green recovery by shortening recovery time, stabilizing performance, and reducing human dependency. RL-agent policies achieve the strongest results, although with a marginal increase in CO2 emissions. We also observe catastrophic forgetting after repeated disruptions, while our policies help maintain steadiness. A comparison with containerized execution shows that containerization cuts CO2 emissions by half. Overall, this research provides models, metrics, and policies that ensure the green recovery of OL-CAIS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GResilience\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u5728\u7ebf\u534f\u4f5cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u97e7\u6027\u548c\u7eff\u8272\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u7eff\u8272\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6062\u590d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u534f\u4f5cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u5e72\u6270\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6062\u590d\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u9650\u5236\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u8fd9\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u97e7\u6027\u4e0e\u7eff\u8272\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7a33\u6001\u3001\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u4e09\u4e2a\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u51faGResilience\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff09\u3001\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u51b3\u7b56\uff08\u53cc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff09\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff09\u4e09\u79cd\u6062\u590d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u97e7\u6027\u548c\u7eff\u8272\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u97e7\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5e72\u6270\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8f6c\u6362\uff0cGResilience\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u8fc7\u7f29\u77ed\u6062\u590d\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6765\u6539\u5584\u7eff\u8272\u6062\u590d\uff0cRL\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7b56\u7565\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\u4f46\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u7565\u6709\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5bb9\u5668\u5316\u6267\u884c\u53ef\u5c06\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u51cf\u534a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u7ebf\u534f\u4f5cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7eff\u8272\u6062\u590d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u97e7\u6027\u4e0e\u7eff\u8272\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}
