However, accurately tracking tissue motion in B-mode ultrasound\nremains challenging due to speckle noise, low edge contrast, and out-of-plane\nmovement. These challenges complicate the task of tracking anatomical landmarks\nover time, which is essential for quantifying tissue dynamics in many clinical\nand research applications. This manuscript introduces DUSTrack (Deep learning\nand optical flow-based toolkit for UltraSound Tracking), a semi-automated\nframework for tracking arbitrary points in B-mode ultrasound videos. We combine\ndeep learning with optical flow to deliver high-quality and robust tracking\nacross diverse anatomical structures and motion patterns. The toolkit includes\na graphical user interface that streamlines the generation of high-quality\ntraining data and supports iterative model refinement. It also implements a\nnovel optical-flow-based filtering technique that reduces high-frequency\nframe-to-frame noise while preserving rapid tissue motion. DUSTrack\ndemonstrates superior accuracy compared to contemporary zero-shot point\ntrackers and performs on par with specialized methods, establishing its\npotential as a general and foundational tool for clinical and biomechanical\nresearch. We demonstrate DUSTrack's versatility through three use cases:\ncardiac wall motion tracking in echocardiograms, muscle deformation analysis\nduring reaching tasks, and fascicle tracking during ankle plantarflexion.

In DFQ, the quantization model must be\ncalibrated using synthetic samples, making the quality of these synthetic\nsamples crucial. Existing methods fail to fully capture and balance the global\nand local features within the samples, resulting in limited synthetic data\nquality. Moreover, we have found that during inference, there is a significant\ndifference in the distributions of intermediate layer activations between the\nquantized and full-precision models. These issues lead to a severe performance\ndegradation of the quantized model. To address these problems, we propose a\npipeline for Data-Free Quantization for Vision Transformers (DFQ-ViT).\nSpecifically, we synthesize samples in order of increasing difficulty,\neffectively enhancing the quality of synthetic data. During the calibration and\ninference stage, we introduce the activation correction matrix for the\nquantized model to align the intermediate layer activations with those of the\nfull-precision model.

Current 3D\nscene-language models often struggle with this relational understanding,\nparticularly when visual embeddings alone do not adequately convey the roles\nand interactions of objects. In this paper, we introduce Descrip3D, a novel and\npowerful framework that explicitly encodes the relationships between objects\nusing natural language. Unlike previous methods that rely only on 2D and 3D\nembeddings, Descrip3D enhances each object with a textual description that\ncaptures both its intrinsic attributes and contextual relationships.

Addressing these\nissues, a novel Multispectral State-Space Feature Fusion framework, dubbed\nMS2Fusion, is proposed based on the state space model (SSM), achieving\nefficient and effective fusion through a dual-path parametric interaction\nmechanism. More specifically, the first cross-parameter interaction branch\ninherits the advantage of cross-attention in mining complementary information\nwith cross-modal hidden state decoding in SSM. The second shared-parameter\nbranch explores cross-modal alignment with joint embedding to obtain\ncross-modal similar semantic features and structures through parameter sharing\nin SSM. Finally, these two paths are jointly optimized with SSM for fusing\nmultispectral features in a unified framework, allowing our MS2Fusion to enjoy\nboth functional complementarity and shared semantic space. In our extensive\nexperiments on mainstream benchmarks including FLIR, M3FD and LLVIP, our\nMS2Fusion significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art multispectral object\ndetection methods, evidencing its superiority.

By jointly modelling fine-grained and\nstructural-level discrimination, Gene-DML is able to learn robust cross-modal\nrepresentations, enhancing both predictive accuracy and generalization across\ndiverse biological contexts.

Recently developed foundational models\nfor 3D reconstruction, such as Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction\n(DUSt3R), Matching and Stereo 3D Reconstruction (MASt3R), and Visual Geometry\nGrounded Transformer (VGGT), have attracted attention due to their ability to\nhandle very sparse image overlaps.

For redundant collections, they can\naccelerate 3D reconstruction by using extremely sparsified image sets.

To address these limitations,\nwe propose HiCroPL, a Hierarchical Cross-modal Prompt Learning framework that\nestablishes bidirectional knowledge flow between text and vision modalities,\nenabling them to refine their semantics mutually. HiCroPL routes knowledge\nflows by leveraging the complementary strengths of text and vision.

In later layers, visual prompts encoding specific\ntask-relevant objects flow back to refine text prompts, enabling deeper\nalignment. Crucially, our hierarchical knowledge mapper allows representations\nat multi-scales to be fused, ensuring that deeper representations retain\ntransferable shallow semantics thereby enhancing generalization. We further\nintroduce a lightweight layer-specific knowledge proxy to enable efficient\ncross-modal interactions.

We propose Regression via Transformer-Based\nClassification (RvTC), which replaces vocabulary-constrained classification\nwith a flexible bin-based approach. Unlike approaches that address\ndiscretization errors through complex distributional modeling, RvTC eliminates\nmanual vocabulary crafting through straightforward bin increase, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance on four image assessment datasets using only\nimages. More importantly, we demonstrate that data-specific prompts\ndramatically improve performance. Unlike generic task descriptions, prompts\ncontaining semantic information about specific images enable MLLMs to leverage\ncross-modal understanding. On the AVA dataset, adding challenge titles to\nprompts improves correlations from 0.83 to 0.90, a new state-of-the-art. We\ndemonstrate through empirical evidence from the AVA and AGIQA-3k datasets that\nMLLMs benefit from semantic prompt information surpassing mere statistical\nbiases. This underscores the importance of incorporating meaningful textual\ncontext in multimodal regression tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faRvTC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7bb1\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u66ff\u4ee3\u9884\u8bbe\u8bcd\u6c47\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9884\u8bbe\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u901a\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRegression via Transformer-Based Classification (RvTC)\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7bb1\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u9884\u8bbe\u8bcd\u6c47\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0cAVA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u6dfb\u52a0\u6311\u6218\u6807\u9898\u540e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4ece0.83\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.90\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u793a\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9MLLMs\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u878d\u5165\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper introduces EBA-AI, an ethics-guided bias-aware\nAI framework to address these challenges. EBA-AI leverages CLIP embeddings to\ndetect and mitigate dataset bias, ensuring balanced representation across\nvaried underwater environments. It also integrates adaptive processing to\noptimize energy efficiency, significantly reducing GPU usage while maintaining\ncompetitive enhancement quality. Experiments on LSUI400, Oceanex, and UIEB100\nshow that while PSNR drops by a controlled 1.0 dB, computational savings enable\nreal-time feasibility for large-scale marine monitoring. Additionally,\nuncertainty estimation and explainability techniques enhance trust in AI-driven\nenvironmental decisions. Comparisons with CycleGAN, FunIEGAN, RAUNENet,\nWaterNet, UGAN, PUGAN, and UTUIE validate EBA-AI's effectiveness in balancing\nefficiency, fairness, and interpretability in underwater image processing.

Due to their subtlety\nand complexity, the generation of text images represents a challenging and\nevolving frontier in the image generation field. The recent surge of\nspecialized image generators (\\emph{e.g.}, Flux-series) and unified generative\nmodels (\\emph{e.g.}, GPT-4o), which demonstrate exceptional fidelity, raises a\nnatural question: can they master the intricacies of text image generation and\nediting? Motivated by this, we assess current state-of-the-art generative\nmodels' capabilities in terms of text image generation and editing. We\nincorporate various typical optical character recognition (OCR) tasks into our\nevaluation and broaden the concept of text-based generation tasks into OCR\ngenerative tasks. We select 33 representative tasks and categorize them into\nfive categories: document, handwritten text, scene text, artistic text, and\ncomplex \\& layout-rich text. For comprehensive evaluation, we examine six\nmodels across both closed-source and open-source domains, using tailored,\nhigh-quality image inputs and prompts.

MeshMamba is efficient and scalable in handling a large\nnumber of input tokens, enabling the generation and reconstruction of body mesh\nmodels with more than 10,000 vertices, capturing clothing and hand geometries.\nThe key to effectively learning MeshMamba is the serialization technique of\nmesh vertices into orderings that are easily processed by Mamba. This is\nachieved by sorting the vertices based on body part annotations or the 3D\nvertex locations of a template mesh, such that the ordering respects the\nstructure of articulated shapes. Based on MeshMamba, we design 1) MambaDiff3D,\na denoising diffusion model for generating 3D articulated meshes and 2)\nMamba-HMR, a 3D human mesh recovery model that reconstructs a human body shape\nand pose from a single image. Experimental results showed that MambaDiff3D can\ngenerate dense 3D human meshes in clothes, with grasping hands, etc., and\noutperforms previous approaches in the 3D human shape generation task.\nAdditionally, Mamba-HMR extends the capabilities of previous non-parametric\nhuman mesh recovery approaches, which were limited to handling body-only poses\nusing around 500 vertex tokens, to the whole-body setting with face and hands,\nwhile achieving competitive performance in (near) real-time.", "AI": {"tldr": "MeshMamba\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eMamba-SSMs\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u751f\u62103D\u5173\u8282\u7f51\u683c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8d85\u8fc710,000\u4e2a\u9876\u70b9\u7684\u5904\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a213D\u7f51\u683c\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u751f\u6210\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u5e26\u6709\u8863\u7269\u548c\u624b\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4eba\u4f53\u7f51\u683c\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7f51\u683c\u9876\u70b9\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u4e3a\u9002\u5408Mamba\u5904\u7406\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8eab\u4f53\u90e8\u4f4d\u6ce8\u91ca\u6216\u6a21\u677f\u7f51\u683c\u76843D\u9876\u70b9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86MambaDiff3D\uff08\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u548cMamba-HMR\uff08\u91cd\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u3002", "result": "MambaDiff3D\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5e26\u6709\u8863\u7269\u548c\u624b\u90e8\u7684\u5bc6\u96c63D\u4eba\u4f53\u7f51\u683c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1bMamba-HMR\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4eba\u4f53\u7f51\u683c\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5168\u8eab\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u9762\u90e8\u548c\u624b\u90e8\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "conclusion": "MeshMamba\u53ca\u5176\u884d\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u57283D\u4eba\u4f53\u7f51\u683c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

However, differential PnP is highly sensitive to noise\nand outliers in the predicted correspondences. This issue hinders the\neffectiveness of correspondence learning. Inspired by the robustness of blind\nPnP against noise and outliers in correspondences, we propose an approximated\nblind PnP based correspondence learning approach.

As a result, our method surpasses\nstate-of-the-art approaches in surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis\non the DTU and MobileBrick datasets.

However, MLLMs continue to\nstruggle with object hallucinations, where models produce seemingly plausible\nbut factually incorrect outputs, including objects that do not exist in the\nimage. Recent work has revealed that the prior knowledge in MLLMs significantly\nsuppresses visual information in deep layers, causing hallucinatory outputs.\nHowever, how these priors suppress visual information at the intermediate layer\nstage in MLLMs remains unclear. We observe that visual factual knowledge and\nthe differences between intermediate-layer prior/original probability\ndistributions show similar evolutionary trends in intermediate layers.\nMotivated by this, we introduce Decoding by Extracting Visual Facts (EVA), a\nsimple, training-free method that dynamically selects intermediate layers with\nthe most significant visual factual information. By contrasting the output\ndistributions of the selected layer derived from the original input and\npure-text input, EVA extracts visual factual knowledge and proportionally\nincorporates it into the final layer to correct the output logits. Importantly,\nEVA is model-agnostic, seamlessly integrates with various classic decoding\nstrategies, and is applicable across different MLLMs. We validate EVA on\nwidely-used benchmarks, and the results show that it significantly reduces\nhallucination rates compared to baseline methods, underscoring its\neffectiveness in mitigating hallucinations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aEVA\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u6765\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u89c9\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u7ed3\u5408\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u751f\u6210\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5728\u6df1\u5c42\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEVA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u89c6\u89c9\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4fe1\u606f\u6700\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5165\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u4ee5\u4fee\u6b63\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cEVA\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "EVA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11MLLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u7ecf\u5178\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u517c\u5bb9\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose the first INR based lossless point cloud\ngeometry compression method called Lossless Implicit Neural Representations for\nPoint Cloud Geometry Compression (LINR-PCGC). To accelerate encoding speed, we\ndesign a group of point clouds level coding framework with an effective network\ninitialization strategy, which can reduce around 60% encoding time.

Although FIQA has been extensively studied and achieved\nsignificant progress, the computational complexity of FIQA algorithms remains a\nkey concern for ensuring scalability and practical deployment in real-world\nsystems. In this paper, we aim to develop a computationally efficient FIQA\nmethod that can be easily deployed in real-world applications. Specifically,\nour method consists of two stages: training a powerful teacher model and\ndistilling a lightweight student model from it. To build a strong teacher\nmodel, we adopt a self-training strategy to improve its capacity. We first\ntrain the teacher model using labeled face images, then use it to generate\npseudo-labels for a set of unlabeled images. These pseudo-labeled samples are\nused in two ways: (1) to distill knowledge into the student model, and (2) to\ncombine with the original labeled images to further enhance the teacher model\nthrough self-training. The enhanced teacher model is used to further\npseudo-label another set of unlabeled images for distilling the student models.\nThe student model is trained using a combination of labeled images,\npseudo-labeled images from the original teacher model, and pseudo-labeled\nimages from the enhanced teacher model. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour student model achieves comparable performance to the teacher model with an\nextremely low computational overhead.

In this paper, we propose TokensGen, a novel two-stage\nframework that leverages condensed tokens to address these issues. Our method\ndecomposes long video generation into three core tasks: (1) inner-clip semantic\ncontrol, (2) long-term consistency control, and (3) inter-clip smooth\ntransition. First, we train To2V (Token-to-Video), a short video diffusion\nmodel guided by text and video tokens, with a Video Tokenizer that condenses\nshort clips into semantically rich tokens. Second, we introduce T2To\n(Text-to-Token), a video token diffusion transformer that generates all tokens\nat once, ensuring global consistency across clips. Finally, during inference,\nan adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips,\nreducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions.

While it has shown good performance, its\nimplementation requires a fixed and unalterable rank, which might be\nchallenging to select given the unique complexities and requirements of each\nmedical imaging downstream task.

Semi-supervised\nsemantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the\nlabeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through\nself-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation\nmodels pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize\nacross domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational\nsegmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as\nan annotator for unlabeled images.

By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models\nto target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the\nstrong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which\nbenefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training\nstrategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training\nstage.

Despite notable\nadvances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human\ncapabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex\nscene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance\nmatching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that\nenables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,\nwe propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that\nshifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and\nutilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames,\nconstructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a\ncomprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames,\nrealizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively\nbalances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching,\ndynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To\nrigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual\nreasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex\nScenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160\nmanually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with\nsubstantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations.

On the other\nhand, the more complex and larger semantic image segmentation models become,\nthe more stressed the devices are when processing data. This paper proposes a\nnovel approach to implementing semantic communication based on splitting the\nsemantic image segmentation process between a resource constrained transmitter\nand the receiver. This allows saving bandwidth by reducing the transmitted data\nwhile maintaining the accuracy of the semantic image segmentation.\nAdditionally, it reduces the computational requirements at the resource\nconstrained transmitter compared to doing all the semantic image segmentation\nin the transmitter. The proposed approach is evaluated by means of\nsimulation-based experiments in terms of different metrics such as\ncomputational resource usage, required bit rate and segmentation accuracy.

However, successful attacks on these systems can lead to\nsevere consequences. Recent research on threats targeting ViT models primarily\nfocuses on generating the smallest adversarial perturbations that can deceive\nthe models with high confidence, without considering their impact on model\ninterpretations. Nevertheless, the use of interpretation models can effectively\nassist in detecting adversarial examples. This study investigates the\nvulnerability of transformer models to adversarial attacks, even when combined\nwith interpretation models. We propose an attack called \"AdViT\" that generates\nadversarial examples capable of misleading both a given transformer model and\nits coupled interpretation model. Through extensive experiments on various\ntransformer models and two transformer-based interpreters, we demonstrate that\nAdViT achieves a 100% attack success rate in both white-box and black-box\nscenarios. In white-box scenarios, it reaches up to 98% misclassification\nconfidence, while in black-box scenarios, it reaches up to 76%\nmisclassification confidence.

This paper traces the conceptual origins of\nself-attention across multiple domains, including computer vision, natural\nlanguage processing, and graph learning, through their shared reliance on an\naffinity matrix, denoted as A. We highlight Infinite Feature Selection (Inf-FS)\nas a foundational approach that generalizes the idea of affinity-based\nweighting. Unlike the fixed dot-product structure used in Transformers, Inf-FS\ndefines A either through domain knowledge or by learning, and computes feature\nrelevance through multi-hop propagation over the affinity graph.

To address this, we introduce CXR-TFT, a novel multi-modal\nframework that integrates temporally sparse CXR imaging and radiology reports\nwith high-frequency clinical data, such as vital signs, laboratory values, and\nrespiratory flow sheets, to predict the trajectory of CXR findings in\ncritically ill patients. CXR-TFT leverages latent embeddings from a vision\nencoder that are temporally aligned with hourly clinical data through\ninterpolation. A transformer model is then trained to predict CXR embeddings at\neach hour, conditioned on previous embeddings and clinical measurements. In a\nretrospective study of 20,000 ICU patients, CXR-TFT demonstrated high accuracy\nin forecasting abnormal CXR findings up to 12 hours before they became\nradiographically evident. This predictive capability in clinical data holds\nsignificant potential for enhancing the management of time-sensitive conditions\nlike acute respiratory distress syndrome, where early intervention is crucial\nand diagnoses are often delayed. By providing distinctive temporal resolution\nin prognostic CXR analysis, CXR-TFT offers actionable 'whole patient' insights\nthat can directly improve clinical outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "CXR-TFT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u7247\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u91cd\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u7684X\u5149\u7247\u7ed3\u679c\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u7247\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u75c7\u76d1\u62a4\u4e2d\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u751f\u6210\u6f5c\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4e0e\u9ad8\u9891\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5229\u7528Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765X\u5149\u7247\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u57282\u4e07\u540dICU\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\uff0cCXR-TFT\u80fd\u63d0\u524d12\u5c0f\u65f6\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38X\u5149\u7247\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "CXR-TFT\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u6539\u5584\u6025\u6027\u547c\u5438\u7a98\u8feb\u7efc\u5408\u5f81\u7b49\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u75c5\u75c7\u7684\u7ba1\u7406\u3002"}}

However, traditional evaluation methods, which\nfocus solely on final accuracy, fail to capture the full dynamics of the\nlearning process. To address this gap, we propose PALM (Performance Analysis of\nActive Learning Models), a unified and interpretable mathematical model that\ncharacterizes AL trajectories through four key parameters: achievable accuracy,\ncoverage efficiency, early-stage performance, and scalability. PALM provides a\npredictive description of AL behavior from partial observations, enabling the\nestimation of future performance and facilitating principled comparisons across\ndifferent strategies. We validate PALM through extensive experiments on\nCIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet-50/100/200, covering a wide range of AL methods and\nself-supervised embeddings. Our results demonstrate that PALM generalizes\neffectively across datasets, budgets, and strategies, accurately predicting\nfull learning curves from limited labeled data. Importantly, PALM reveals\ncrucial insights into learning efficiency, data space coverage, and the\nscalability of AL methods. By enabling the selection of cost-effective\nstrategies and predicting performance under tight budget constraints, PALM lays\nthe basis for more systematic, reproducible, and data-efficient evaluation of\nAL in both research and real-world applications.

The\napplication to inverse rendering still faces several challenges, as the\ndiscrete nature of Gaussian primitives makes it difficult to apply geometry\nconstraints. Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra\ncontinuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian\nprimitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing\nmemory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a\ndiscretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by\nencoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us\nto link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity\ntransformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the\ncomputational cost of ray marching.The key challenge is to regularize the\ndiscrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete\nrepresentation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (\\eg Eikonal\nloss). For this, we project Gaussians onto the zero-level set of SDF and\nenforce alignment with the surface from splatting, namely a projection-based\nconsistency loss. Thanks to the discretized SDF, our method achieves higher\nrelighting quality, while requiring no extra memory beyond GS and avoiding\ncomplex manually designed optimization.

We build on recent advances in foveated image\nprocessing and apply them to an Active Vision robot system that emulates both\nhuman head movement and eye tracking.

Given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs)\nin robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated\npatch tokenization scheme inspired by recent work in image segmentation.\nCompared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number\nof tokens-and thus computation-without sacrificing visual fidelity near regions\nof interest. We also explore two approaches to gaze imitation and prediction\nfrom human data.

Our analysis reveals that continuous modeling provides\nsuperior robustness to interface variations and enhanced generalization to\nunseen layouts, establishing a new paradigm for spatial reasoning in GUI\ninteraction tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faGUI-G\u00b2\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdbGUI\u4ea4\u4e92\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8c\u5143\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u70b9\u51fb\u884c\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u5f62\u6210\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "GUI-G\u00b2\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u8fde\u7eed\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u5dee\u673a\u5236\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u5143\u7d20\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGUI-G\u00b2\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eUI-TARS-72B\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534724.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fde\u7eed\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u754c\u9762\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3aGUI\u4ea4\u4e92\u4efb\u52a1\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Recently,\ndiffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though\ntheir advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we\nsystematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where\ntraining involves repeated passes over limited data-and find that they\nsignificantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce.\nDiffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation\nloss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as\nimplicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse\ndistribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed\nleft-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and\nderive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which\ndiffusion begins to outperform AR. These results suggest that when data, not\ncompute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to\nthe standard AR paradigm.
