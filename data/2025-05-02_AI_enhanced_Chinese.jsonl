Despite significant advances in video\nsynthesis, creating 3D videos remains challenging due to the relative scarcity\nof 3D video data. We propose a simple approach for transforming a text-to-video\ngenerator into a video-to-stereo generator. Given an input video, our framework\nautomatically produces the video frames from a shifted viewpoint, enabling a\ncompelling 3D effect. Prior and concurrent approaches for this task typically\noperate in multiple phases, first estimating video disparity or depth, then\nwarping the video accordingly to produce a second view, and finally inpainting\nthe disoccluded regions. This approach inherently fails when the scene involves\nspecular surfaces or transparent objects. In such cases, single-layer disparity\nestimation is insufficient, resulting in artifacts and incorrect pixel shifts\nduring warping. Our work bypasses these restrictions by directly synthesizing\nthe new viewpoint, avoiding any intermediate steps. This is achieved by\nleveraging a pre-trained video model's priors on geometry, object materials,\noptics, and semantics, without relying on external geometry models or manually\ndisentangling geometry from the synthesis process.

The fundamental challenge in CGH is solving the inverse problem of\nphase retrieval from intensity measurements. Physics-inspired neural networks\n(PINNs), especially Gerchberg-Saxton-based PINNs (GS-PINNs), have advanced\nphase retrieval capabilities. However, their performance strongly depends on\nforward models (FMs) and their hyperparameters (FMHs), limiting generalization,\ncomplicating benchmarking, and hindering hardware optimization. We present a\nsystematic sensitivity analysis framework based on Saltelli's extension of\nSobol's method to quantify FMH impacts on GS-PINN performance. Our analysis\ndemonstrates that SLM pixel-resolution is the primary factor affecting neural\nnetwork sensitivity, followed by pixel-pitch, propagation distance, and\nwavelength. Free space propagation forward models demonstrate superior neural\nnetwork performance compared to Fourier holography, providing enhanced\nparameterization and generalization.

To this effect, we focus on\ndiscovery of the \"game behaviours\" as micro-patterns formed by continuous\nsequence of games and the persistent \"play styles\" of the players' as a\nsequence of such sequences on an online skill gaming platform for Rummy. We\npropose a two stage deep neural network, CognitionNet. The first stage focuses\non mining game behaviours as cluster representations in a latent space while\nthe second aggregates over these micro patterns to discover play styles via a\nsupervised classification objective around player engagement. The dual\nobjective allows CognitionNet to reveal several player psychology inspired\ndecision making and tactics. To our knowledge, this is the first and\none-of-its-kind research to fully automate the discovery of: (i) player\npsychology and game tactics from telemetry data; and (ii) relevant diagnostic\nexplanations to players' engagement predictions. The collaborative training of\nthe two networks with differential input dimensions is enabled using a novel\nformulation of \"bridge loss\". The network plays pivotal role in obtaining\nhomogeneous and consistent play style definitions and significantly outperforms\nthe SOTA baselines wherever applicable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCognitionNet\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5728\u7ebf\u6280\u80fd\u6e38\u620f\u5e73\u53f0\uff08\u5982Rummy\uff09\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u73a9\u5bb6\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u6e38\u620f\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63ed\u793a\u73a9\u5bb6\u5fc3\u7406\u548c\u6218\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6e38\u620f\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4ee5\u53cd\u6620\u73a9\u5bb6\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6316\u6398\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u73a9\u5bb6\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u6316\u6398\u6e38\u620f\u884c\u4e3a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u76ee\u6807\u805a\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5fae\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u6e38\u620f\u98ce\u683c\u3002", "result": "CognitionNet\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u73a9\u5bb6\u5fc3\u7406\u548c\u6218\u672f\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u9065\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u53d1\u73b0\u73a9\u5bb6\u5fc3\u7406\u548c\u6218\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u73a9\u5bb6\u53c2\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u8bca\u65ad\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

It receives textual task instruction and GUI description to generate\nexecutable actions (\\emph{e.g.}, click) and operation boxes step by step.\nTraining a GUI agent mainly involves grounding and planning stages, in which\nthe GUI grounding focuses on finding the execution coordinates according to the\ntask, while the planning stage aims to predict the next action based on\nhistorical actions. However, previous work suffers from the limitations of\ninsufficient training data for GUI grounding, as well as the ignorance of\nbacktracking historical behaviors for GUI planning. To handle the above\nchallenges, we propose ScaleTrack, a training framework by scaling grounding\nand backtracking planning for automated GUI agents. We carefully collected GUI\nsamples of different synthesis criterions from a wide range of sources, and\nunified them into the same template for training GUI grounding models.\nMoreover, we design a novel training strategy that predicts the next action\nfrom the current GUI image, while also backtracking the historical actions that\nled to the GUI image.

Methods: We developed a BOC model to\nclassify auto-contour quality and quantify prediction uncertainty. A\ncalibration step was used to optimize uncertainty thresholds that meet clinical\naccuracy needs. The method was validated under three data scenarios: no manual\nlabels, limited labels, and extensive labels. For rectum contours in prostate\ncancer, we applied geometric surrogate labels when manual labels were absent,\ntransfer learning when limited, and direct supervision when ample labels were\navailable. Results: The BOC model delivered robust performance across all\nscenarios. Fine-tuning with just 30 manual labels and calibrating with 34\nsubjects yielded over 90% accuracy on test data. Using the calibrated\nthreshold, over 93% of the auto-contours' qualities were accurately predicted\nin over 98% of cases, reducing unnecessary manual reviews and highlighting\ncases needing correction.

To employ INR in real-life, it is important to speed up\ntraining. In the field of INR for video applications, the state-of-the-art\napproach employs grid-type parametric encoding and successfully achieves a\nfaster encoding speed in comparison to its predecessors. However, the grid\nusage, which does not consider the video's dynamic nature, leads to redundant\nuse of trainable parameters. As a result, it has significantly lower parameter\nefficiency and higher bitrate compared to NeRV-style methods that do not use a\nparametric encoding. To address the problem, we propose Neural Video\nrepresentation with Temporally coherent Modulation (NVTM), a novel framework\nthat can capture dynamic characteristics of video. By decomposing the\nspatio-temporal 3D video data into a set of 2D grids with flow information,\nNVTM enables learning video representation rapidly and uses parameter\nefficiently. Our framework enables to process temporally corresponding pixels\nat once, resulting in the fastest encoding speed for a reasonable video\nquality, especially when compared to the NeRV-style method, with a speed\nincrease of over 3 times. Also, it remarks an average of 1.54dB/0.019\nimprovements in PSNR/LPIPS on UVG (Dynamic) (even with 10% fewer parameters)\nand an average of 1.84dB/0.013 improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on MCL-JCV (Dynamic),\ncompared to previous grid-type works.

This requires careful planning, often via magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI)-based anatomical 3D models. However, creating these\nmodels is often time-consuming and user dependent. We organized the Surgical\nPlanning in Pediatric Neuroblastoma (SPPIN) challenge, to stimulate\ndevelopments on this topic, and set a benchmark for fully automatic\nsegmentation of neuroblastoma on multi-model MRI. The challenge started with a\ntraining phase, where teams received 78 sets of MRI scans from 34 patients,\nconsisting of both diagnostic and post-chemotherapy MRI scans. The final test\nphase, consisting of 18 MRI sets from 9 patients, determined the ranking of the\nteams. Ranking was based on the Dice similarity coefficient (Dice score), the\n95th percentile of the Hausdorff distance (HD95) and the volumetric similarity\n(VS). The SPPIN challenge was hosted at MICCAI 2023. The final leaderboard\nconsisted of 9 teams. The highest-ranking team achieved a median Dice score\n0.82, a median HD95 of 7.69 mm and a VS of 0.91, utilizing a large, pretrained\nnetwork called STU-Net. A significant difference for the segmentation results\nbetween diagnostic and post-chemotherapy MRI scans was observed (Dice = 0.89 vs\nDice = 0.59, P = 0.01) for the highest-ranking team. SPPIN is the first medical\nsegmentation challenge in extracranial pediatric oncology. The highest-ranking\nteam used a large pre-trained network, suggesting that pretraining can be of\nuse in small, heterogenous datasets. Although the results of the\nhighest-ranking team were high for most patients, segmentation especially in\nsmall, pre-treated tumors were insufficient.

Top-performing methods currently integrate 2D segmentation\nwith geometry-aware 3D primitives. However, the advantage would be lost without\nhigh-fidelity 3D point clouds, such as methods based on Neural Radiance Field\n(NeRF). These methods are limited by the insufficient capacity to maintain\nconsistency across partial observations. To address this, recent works have\nutilized contrastive loss or cross-view association pre-processing for view\nconsensus. In contrast to them, we present Cues3D, a compact approach that\nrelies solely on NeRF instead of pre-associations. The core idea is that NeRF's\nimplicit 3D field inherently establishes a globally consistent geometry,\nenabling effective object distinction without explicit cross-view supervision.\nWe propose a three-phase training framework for NeRF,\ninitialization-disambiguation-refinement, whereby the instance IDs are\ncorrected using the initially-learned knowledge. Additionally, an instance\ndisambiguation method is proposed to match NeRF-rendered 3D masks and ensure\nglobally unique 3D instance identities. With the aid of Cues3D, we obtain\nhighly consistent and unique 3D instance ID for each object across views with a\nbalanced version of NeRF. Our experiments are conducted on ScanNet v2,\nScanNet200, ScanNet++, and Replica datasets for 3D instance, panoptic, and\nsemantic segmentation tasks.

However, existing methods still face substantial challenges\nin capturing fine geometric details and maintaining animation stability,\nparticularly under dynamic or complex poses. To address these issues, we\npropose a novel real-time framework for animatable human avatar reconstruction\nbased on 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS). By leveraging 2DGS and global SMPL pose\nparameters, our framework not only aligns positional and rotational\ndiscrepancies but also enables robust and natural pose-driven animation of the\nreconstructed avatars. Furthermore, we introduce a Rotation Compensation\nNetwork (RCN) that learns rotation residuals by integrating local geometric\nfeatures with global pose parameters. This network significantly improves the\nhandling of non-rigid deformations and ensures smooth, artifact-free pose\ntransitions during animation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\nsuccessfully reconstructs realistic and highly animatable human avatars from\nmonocular videos, effectively preserving fine-grained details while ensuring\nstable and natural pose variation.

For context, we also assess two\nlarge language models (TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct and ChatGPT-4o). Accuracy and\nF1-score serve as evaluation metrics.\n  Results DeBERTa-v3-large attains the best mean accuracy (0.860) and F1-score\n(0.662), outperforming all other models. It maintains robust F1 across both\nhigh-frequency emotions (e.g., Joy, Anticipation) and low-frequency emotions\n(e.g., Anger, Trust). The LLMs lag, with ChatGPT-4o and\nTinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct scoring 0.527 and 0.292 in mean F1, respectively.\n  Conclusion The fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3-large model currently offers the most\nreliable solution for binary emotion classification in Japanese. We release\nthis model as a pip-installable package (pip install\ndeberta-emotion-predictor).

However, manual object tracking\nand matching across multiple non-overlapping cameras pose significant\nchallenges in city-scale urban traffic scenarios. These challenges include\nhandling diverse vehicle attributes, occlusions, illumination variations,\nshadows, and varying video resolutions. To address these issues, we propose an\nefficient and cost-effective deep learning-based framework for Multi-Object\nMulti-Camera Tracking (MO-MCT).

Pre-training on large datasets have been shown to help models\nlearn transferable representations and adapt with minimal labeled data. This\nbehavior is especially valuable in medical imaging, where annotations are often\nscarce. However, applying this paradigm to multimodal medical data introduces a\nchallenge: most existing approaches assume that all imaging modalities are\navailable during both pre-training and fine-tuning. In practice, missing\nmodalities often occur due to acquisition issues, specialist unavailability, or\nspecific experimental designs on small in-house datasets. Consequently, a\ncommon approach involves training a separate model for each desired modality\ncombination, making the process both resource-intensive and impractical for\nclinical use. Therefore, we introduce BM-MAE, a masked image modeling\npre-training strategy tailored for multimodal MRI data. The same pre-trained\nmodel seamlessly adapts to any combination of available modalities, extracting\nrich representations that capture both intra- and inter-modal information. This\nallows fine-tuning on any subset of modalities without requiring architectural\nchanges, while still benefiting from a model pre-trained on the full set of\nmodalities. Extensive experiments show that the proposed pre-training strategy\noutperforms or remains competitive with baselines that require separate\npre-training for each modality subset, while substantially surpassing training\nfrom scratch on several downstream tasks.

At the model compression\nlevel, compression techniques including 4-bit weight quantization are\nimplemented while preserving the core representation ability for medical\nreasoning. At the computational optimization level, inference optimization\ntechniques such as Flash Attention acceleration and continuous batching are\nintegrated, and a professional prompt template system is constructed to adapt\nto different types of medical problems. Experimental results on medical\nquestion-answering datasets show that the method proposed in this paper\nmaintains professional accuracy while reducing memory consumption by 64.7\\% and\ninference latency by 12.4\\%, providing an effective solution for the\napplication of medical large models in resource-constrained environments such\nas edge computing devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u533b\u7597\u5782\u76f4\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u5316\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u7597\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982DeepSeek-R1\u548cChatGPT\uff09\u5728\u901a\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u58c1\u5792\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u73af\u5883\u9650\u5236\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "1. \u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u7ba1\u9053\u4ece\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528LoRA\u6280\u672f\u8c03\u6574\u5173\u952e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u30022. \u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\uff1a\u5b9e\u73b04\u4f4d\u6743\u91cd\u91cf\u5316\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u30023. \u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u5316\uff1a\u96c6\u6210Flash Attention\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u6279\u5904\u7406\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e13\u4e1a\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u677f\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u533b\u7597\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e13\u4e1a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u51cf\u5c1164.7%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e12.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\uff08\u5982\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bbe\u5907\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u533b\u7597\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Drawing\ninsights from cognitive science, where humans employ high-level abstraction to\nsimplify complex problems before delving into specifics, we introduce a novel\nself-training algorithm: LEarning to Plan before Answering (LEPA). LEPA trains\nthe LLM to formulate anticipatory plans, which serve as abstract meta-knowledge\nfor problem-solving, before engaging with the intricacies of problems. This\napproach not only outlines the solution generation path but also shields the\nLLM from the distraction of irrelevant details. During data generation, LEPA\nfirst crafts an anticipatory plan based on the problem, and then generates a\nsolution that aligns with both the plan and the problem. LEPA refines the plan\nthrough self-reflection, aiming to acquire plans that are instrumental in\nyielding correct solutions. During model optimization, the LLM is trained to\npredict both the refined plans and the corresponding solutions. By efficiently\nextracting and utilizing the anticipatory plans, LEPA demonstrates remarkable\nsuperiority over conventional algorithms on various challenging natural\nlanguage reasoning benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLEPA\u7684\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u524d\u751f\u6210\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u751f\u6210\u9010\u6b65\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u62bd\u8c61\u5143\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6355\u6349\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u62bd\u8c61\u3002", "method": "LEPA\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u751f\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u8ba1\u5212\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5143\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u53cd\u601d\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u8ba1\u5212\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "LEPA\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "LEPA\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Delhi, being one\nof the most polluted cities globally, experiences chronic air quality issues\ndue to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction dust, which\nexacerbate its already fragile atmospheric conditions. Traditional pollution\nmitigation strategies, such as static air purifying installations, often fail\nto maximize their impact due to suboptimal placement and limited adaptability\nto dynamic urban environments. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) framework to optimize the placement of air purification booths\nto improve the air quality index (AQI) in the city of Delhi. We employ Proximal\nPolicy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm,\nto iteratively learn and identify high-impact locations based on multiple\nspatial and environmental factors, including population density, traffic\npatterns, industrial influence, and green space constraints. Our approach is\nbenchmarked against conventional placement strategies, including random and\ngreedy AQI-based methods, using multi-dimensional performance evaluation\nmetrics such as AQI improvement, spatial coverage, population and traffic\nimpact, and spatial entropy.

URBAN-SIM contains three critical modules:\nHierarchical Urban Generation pipeline, Interactive Dynamics Generation\nstrategy, and Asynchronous Scene Sampling scheme, to improve the diversity,\nrealism, and efficiency of robot learning in simulation.

Employing a mixed-methods\napproach, we analyzed quantitative shifts in usage patterns and attitudes as\nwell as qualitative narratives of student experiences.\n  While the overall frequency of GenAI usage for homework or programming\nprojects remained largely stable, we observed large effect sizes in comfort and\nopenness across conceptual, debugging, and homework problems. Notably, usage\npatterns for debugging also shifted statistically significantly, reflecting\nstudents' more mindful and deliberate approach. Focus group discussions\ncorroborated these results, suggesting that the intervention \"bridged the gap\"\nbetween naive GenAI usage and more nuanced, reflective integration of AI tools\ninto coursework, ultimately heightening students' awareness of their own skill\ndevelopment.\n  These findings suggest that structured, scaffolded interventions can enable\nstudents to harness GenAI's benefits without undermining essential\ncompetencies.

However, hyperspectral\nsuper-resolution remains an ill-posed problem due to the high spectral\ndimensionality of the data and the scarcity of available training samples.\nMoreover, existing methods often rely on large models with a high number of\nparameters or require the fusion with panchromatic or RGB images, both of which\nare often impractical in real-world scenarios. Inspired by the MobileNet\narchitecture, we introduce a lightweight depthwise separable dilated\nconvolutional network (DSDCN) to address the aforementioned challenges.\nSpecifically, our model leverages multiple depthwise separable convolutions,\nsimilar to the MobileNet architecture, and further incorporates a dilated\nconvolution fusion block to make the model more flexible for the extraction of\nboth spatial and spectral features. In addition, we propose a custom loss\nfunction that combines mean squared error (MSE), an L2 norm\nregularization-based constraint, and a spectral angle-based loss, ensuring the\npreservation of both spectral and spatial details. The proposed model achieves\nvery competitive performance on two publicly available hyperspectral datasets,\nmaking it well-suited for hyperspectral image super-resolution tasks.

Building an automated\ndesign framework is challenging due to the complexities of representing glider\nshapes and the high computational costs associated with modeling complex\nsolid-fluid interactions. In this work, we introduce an AI-enhanced automated\ncomputational framework designed to overcome these limitations by enabling the\ncreation of underwater robots with non-trivial hull shapes. Our approach\ninvolves an algorithm that co-optimizes both shape and control signals,\nutilizing a reduced-order geometry representation and a differentiable\nneural-network-based fluid surrogate model.

By integrating these two components, the framework derives\nvehicle intra-spacing over a 3D road surface as the solution of a stochastic\nordinary differential equation, yielding high-fidelity surrogate safety\nmeasures such as time-to-collision (TTC). To demonstrate its effectiveness, the\nframework is analyzed using stochastic numerical methods comprising 4th-order\nRunge-Kutta integration and AI inference, generating probability-weighted\nhigh-fidelity TTC (HF-TTC) distributions that reflect complex multi-agent\nmaneuvers and behavioral uncertainties. Evaluated with HF-TTC against\ntraditional constant-velocity TTC and non-interaction-aware approaches on\nhighway datasets, the proposed framework offers a systematic methodology for\nactive safety analysis with enhanced potential for improving safety perception\nin complex traffic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8d85\u56feAI\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u4ea4\u901a\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982TTC\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u901a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u5230\u8f66\u8f86\u95f4\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u901a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u8003\u8651\u9053\u8def\u5761\u5ea6\uff09\u548c\u8d85\u56feAI\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f66\u8f86\u95f4\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u9636\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cAI\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771fTTC\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u7684HF-TTC\u5206\u5e03\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u590d\u6742\u591a\u8f66\u8f86\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u901a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The dynamic nature of this data, characterized by\ncontinuous changes or data drift, poses significant challenges for on-device\nmodels. To address this issue, continual learning (CL) is proposed, enabling\nmachine learning models to incrementally update their knowledge and mitigate\ncatastrophic forgetting. However, the traditional centralized approach to CL is\nunsuitable for end devices due to privacy and data volume concerns. In this\ncontext, federated continual learning (FCL) emerges as a promising solution,\npreserving user data locally while enhancing models through collaborative\nupdates. Aiming at the challenges of limited storage resources for CL, poor\nautonomy in task shift detection, and difficulty in coping with new adversarial\ntasks in FCL scenario, we propose a novel FCL framework named SacFL.

This becomes even more necessary in mixed logistics scenarios where\ncouriers handle a high volume of delivery and a smaller number of pickup\nsimultaneously. However, most of the related works treat the pickup and\ndelivery patterns on couriers' decision behavior equally, neglecting that the\npickup has a greater impact on couriers' decision-making compared to the\ndelivery due to its tighter time constraints. In such context, we have three\nmain challenges: 1) multiple spatiotemporal factors are intricately\ninterconnected, significantly affecting couriers' delivery behavior; 2) pickups\nhave stricter time requirements but are limited in number, making it\nchallenging to model their effects on couriers' delivery process; 3) couriers'\nspatial mobility patterns are critical determinants of their delivery behavior,\nbut have been insufficiently explored. To deal with these, we propose TransPDT,\na Transformer-based multi-task package delivery time prediction model. We first\nemploy the Transformer encoder architecture to capture the spatio-temporal\ndependencies of couriers' historical travel routes and pending package sets.\nThen we design the pattern memory to learn the patterns of pickup in the\nimbalanced dataset via attention mechanism.

This becomes even more critical\nduring anomaly conditions like the epidemic outbreak, during which couriers'\ndelivery timely rate will decline markedly and fluctuates significantly.\nExisting studies pay less attention to the logistics scenario. Moreover, many\nworks focusing on prediction tasks in anomaly scenarios fail to explicitly\nmodel abnormal events, e.g., treating external factors equally with other\nfeatures, resulting in great information loss. Further, since some anomalous\nevents occur infrequently, traditional data-driven methods perform poorly in\nthese scenarios. To deal with them, we propose a deep spatial-temporal\nattention model, named DeepSTA. To be specific, to avoid information loss, we\ndesign an anomaly spatio-temporal learning module that employs a recurrent\nneural network to model incident information. Additionally, we utilize Node2vec\nto model correlations between road districts, and adopt graph neural networks\nand long short-term memory to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of\ncouriers. To tackle the issue of insufficient training data in abnormal\ncircumstances, we propose an anomaly pattern attention module that adopts a\nmemory network for couriers' anomaly feature patterns storage via attention\nmechanisms.

This work investigates the application of MI\ntechniques to NNs within the context of causal inference for bio-statistics.\n  We demonstrate that MI tools can be leveraged to: (1) probe and validate the\ninternal representations learned by NNs, such as those estimating nuisance\nfunctions in frameworks like Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation (TMLE); (2)\ndiscover and visualize the distinct computational pathways employed by the\nnetwork to process different types of inputs, potentially revealing how\nconfounders and treatments are handled; and (3) provide methodologies for\ncomparing the learned mechanisms and extracted insights across statistical,\nmachine learning, and NN models, fostering a deeper understanding of their\nrespective strengths and weaknesses for causal bio-statistical analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff08MI\uff09\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u6790\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08NNs\uff09\u5728\u751f\u7269\u7edf\u8ba1\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u751f\u7269\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e2d\u867d\u5f3a\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u2018\u9ed1\u76d2\u2019\u7279\u6027\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5065\u5eb7\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5e94\u7528MI\u6280\u672f\u5206\u6790NNs\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3001\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8f93\u5165\u5904\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "MI\u5de5\u5177\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9a8c\u8bc1NNs\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u3001\u63ed\u793a\u8f93\u5165\u5904\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u56e0\u679c\u751f\u7269\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "MI\u6280\u672f\u4e3aNNs\u5728\u751f\u7269\u7edf\u8ba1\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Existing methods\nsuffer from performance degradation when extending to longer contexts. In this\nwork, we introduce a novel context extension method that optimizes both\nfine-tuning and inference efficiency.

Data and models are available at\n  https://github.com/RUCBM/DeepCritic", "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving, providing accurate\nfeedback and scalable oversight on their outputs becomes an urgent and critical\nproblem. Leveraging LLMs as critique models to achieve automated supervision is\na promising solution. In this work, we focus on studying and enhancing the math\ncritique ability of LLMs. Current LLM critics provide critiques that are too\nshallow and superficial on each step, leading to low judgment accuracy and\nstruggling to offer sufficient feedback for the LLM generator to correct\nmistakes. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel and effective two-stage\nframework to develop LLM critics that are capable of deliberately critiquing on\neach reasoning step of math solutions. In the first stage, we utilize\nQwen2.5-72B-Instruct to generate 4.5K long-form critiques as seed data for\nsupervised fine-tuning. Each seed critique consists of deliberate step-wise\ncritiques that includes multi-perspective verifications as well as in-depth\ncritiques of initial critiques for each reasoning step. Then, we perform\nreinforcement learning on the fine-tuned model with either existing\nhuman-labeled data from PRM800K or our automatically annotated data obtained\nvia Monte Carlo sampling-based correctness estimation, to further incentivize\nits critique ability. Our developed critique model built on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct\nnot only significantly outperforms existing LLM critics (including the\nsame-sized DeepSeek-R1-distill models and GPT-4o) on various error\nidentification benchmarks, but also more effectively helps the LLM generator\nrefine erroneous steps through more detailed feedback.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6279\u5224\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLMs\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u76d1\u7763\u6210\u4e3a\u7d27\u8feb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6279\u5224\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u76d1\u7763\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct\u751f\u62104.5K\u957f\u5f62\u5f0f\u6279\u5224\u6570\u636e\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7684Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct\u6279\u5224\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982DeepSeek-R1-distill\u548cGPT-4o\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u8be6\u7ec6\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLMs\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6279\u5224\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u3002"}}
