As aging is closely associated with increased fall risk,\nparticularly in wet and confined environments such as bathrooms where over 80\npercent of falls occur. Although recent research has increasingly focused on\nnon-intrusive, privacy-preserving approaches that do not rely on wearable\ndevices or video-based monitoring, these efforts have not fully overcome the\nlimitations of existing unimodal systems (e.g., WiFi-, infrared-, or\nmmWave-based), which are prone to reduced accuracy in complex environments.\nThese limitations stem from fundamental constraints in unimodal sensing,\nincluding system bias and environmental interference, such as multipath fading\nin WiFi-based systems and drastic temperature changes in infrared-based\nmethods. To address these challenges, we propose a Privacy-Preserving\nMultimodal Fall Detection System for Elderly People in Bathroom Environments.\nFirst, we develop a sensor evaluation framework to select and fuse\nmillimeter-wave radar with 3D vibration sensing, and use it to construct and\npreprocess a large-scale, privacy-preserving multimodal dataset in real\nbathroom settings, which will be released upon publication.

In real-world settings, the data quality (DQ) of different\nsources and modalities usually varies due to unexpected environmental factors\nor sensor issues. However, both researchers and practitioners in the AV field\noverwhelmingly concentrate on models/algorithms while undervaluing the DQ. To\nfulfill the needs of the next-generation AVs with guarantees of functionality,\nefficiency, and trustworthiness, this paper proposes a novel task-centric and\ndata quality vase framework which consists of five layers: data layer, DQ\nlayer, task layer, application layer, and goal layer. The proposed framework\naims to map DQ with task requirements and performance goals. To illustrate, a\ncase study investigating redundancy on the nuScenes dataset proves that\npartially removing redundancy on multisource image data could improve YOLOv8\nobject detection task performance. Analysis on multimodal data of image and\nLiDAR further presents existing redundancy DQ issues. This paper opens up a\nrange of critical but unexplored challenges at the intersection of DQ, task\norchestration, and performance-oriented system development in AVs.

Our network utilizes the high\ntemporal resolution of event cameras through an asynchronous Graph Neural\nNetwork and integrates it with spatial features extracted by a CNN from RGB\nimages. This combination effectively captures both the temporal dynamics and\nspatial details of the driving environment, enabling swift and precise anomaly\ndetection. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach\noutperforms existing methods in both accuracy and response time, achieving\nmillisecond-level real-time performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u65f6\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u548cRGB\u76f8\u673a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6b65\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548cCNN\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6ce8\u91cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u800c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u5bf9\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5f02\u6b65\u6df7\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u548cRGB\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f02\u6b65GNN\u548cCNN\u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

We introduce Scene-R1, a video-grounded framework that learns to\nreason about 3D scenes without any point-wise 3D instance supervision by\npairing reinforcement-learning-driven reasoning with a two-stage grounding\npipeline. In the temporal grounding stage, we explicitly reason about the video\nand select the video snippets most relevant to an open-ended query.

After that, we track the object using SAM2 to produce\npixel-accurate masks in RGB frames, and project them back into 3D, thereby\neliminating the need for 3D detector-based proposals while capturing fine\ngeometry and material cues. Scene-R1 can also adapt to the 3D visual question\nanswering task to answer free-form questions directly from video.

This raises a\ncritical question: how can we design physically realizable, scene-adaptive, and\ntransferable attacks against SDE under realistic constraints?\n  To answer this, we make two key contributions. First, we propose a unified\nattack framework that extends optimization-based techniques to four core stages\nof stereo matching: feature extraction, cost-volume construction, cost\naggregation, and disparity regression. A comprehensive stage-wise evaluation\nacross 9 mainstream SDE models, under constraints like photometric consistency,\nreveals that optimization-based patches suffer from poor transferability.\nInterestingly, partially transferable patches suggest that patterns, rather\nthan pixel-level perturbations, may be key to generalizable attacks.

PatchHunter formulates patch generation as a reinforcement\nlearning-driven search over a structured space of visual patterns crafted to\ndisrupt SDE assumptions.\n  We validate PatchHunter across three levels: the KITTI dataset, the CARLA\nsimulator, and real-world vehicle deployment.

Recent\nmethods commonly utilize a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to\nsynthesize new content of previously unseen regions along camera movement.\nHowever, the underlying 2D diffusion model lacks 3D awareness and results in\ndistorted artifacts. Moreover, they are limited to generating views of static\n3D scenes, neglecting to capture object movements within the dynamic 4D world.\nTo alleviate these issues, we present DreamJourney, a two-stage framework that\nleverages the world simulation capacity of video diffusion models to trigger a\nnew perpetual scene view generation task with both camera movements and object\ndynamics. Specifically, in stage I, DreamJourney first lifts the input image to\n3D point cloud and renders a sequence of partial images from a specific camera\ntrajectory. A video diffusion model is then utilized as generative prior to\ncomplete the missing regions and enhance visual coherence across the sequence,\nproducing a cross-view consistent video adheres to the 3D scene and camera\ntrajectory. Meanwhile, we introduce two simple yet effective strategies (early\nstopping and view padding) to further stabilize the generation process and\nimprove visual quality. Next, in stage II, DreamJourney leverages a multimodal\nlarge language model to produce a text prompt describing object movements in\ncurrent view, and uses video diffusion model to animate current view with\nobject movements. Stage I and II are repeated recurrently, enabling perpetual\ndynamic scene view generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our DreamJourney over state-of-the-art methods both\nquantitatively and qualitatively.

In\norder to analyze the dynamic and static components of videos acquired under\nundesirable conditions, such as hardware, environmental, and power limitations,\nit is essential to establish an FBS method that can handle videos with low\nframe rates and various types of noise. Existing FBS methods have two\nlimitations that prevent us from accurately separating foreground and\nbackground components from such degraded videos. First, they only capture\neither data-specific or general features of the components. Second, they do not\ninclude explicit models for various types of noise to remove them in the FBS\nprocess. To this end, we propose a robust FBS method with a CSR-based\nforeground model. This model can adaptively capture specific spatial structures\nscattered in imaging data. Then, we formulate FBS as a constrained multiconvex\noptimization problem that incorporates CSR, functions that capture general\nfeatures, and explicit noise characterization functions for multiple types of\nnoise. Thanks to these functions, our method captures both data-specific and\ngeneral features to accurately separate the components from various types of\nnoise even under low frame rates.

To\naddress this challenge and leverage the strengths of both modalities, we\npropose a LiDAR detection framework enhanced by 4D radar motion status and\ncross-modal uncertainty. The object movement information from 4D radar is first\ncaptured using a Dynamic Motion-Aware Encoding module during feature extraction\nto enhance 4D radar predictions. Subsequently, the instance-wise uncertainties\nof bounding boxes are estimated to mitigate the cross-modal misalignment and\nrefine the final LiDAR predictions. Extensive experiments on the View-of-Delft\n(VoD) dataset highlight the effectiveness of our method, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance with the mAP of 74.89% in the entire area and\n88.70% within the driving corridor while maintaining a real-time inference\nspeed of 30.02 FPS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u54084D\u96f7\u8fbe\u8fd0\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684LiDAR\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3LiDAR\u548c4D\u96f7\u8fbe\u878d\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728VoD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "LiDAR\u548c4D\u96f7\u8fbe\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u5404\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u878d\u5408\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u53d64D\u96f7\u8fbe\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f18\u5316LiDAR\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728VoD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6574\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\u7684mAP\u8fbe\u523074.89%\uff0c\u9a7e\u9a76\u8d70\u5eca\u5185\u8fbe\u523088.70%\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u4e3a30.02 FPS\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86LiDAR\u548c4D\u96f7\u8fbe\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

We start by proposing a novel automated approach to create the first\nrobustness evaluation benchmark for HOI detection. Subsequently, we evaluate\nmore than 40 existing HOI detection models on this benchmark, showing their\ninsufficiency, analyzing the features of different frameworks, and discussing\nhow the robustness in HOI is different from other tasks. With the insights from\nsuch analyses, we propose to improve the robustness of HOI detection methods\nthrough: (1) a cross-domain data augmentation integrated with mixup, and (2) a\nfeature fusion strategy with frozen vision foundation models.

To address these limitations, we propose a\nnovel Multiple instance learning framework with Context-Aware Clustering\n(MiCo), designed to enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations and\nstrengthen inter-tissue semantic associations in WSIs.

These semantic anchors act as contextual hubs, propagating\nsemantic relationships to refine instance-level representations. To eliminate\nsemantic fragmentation and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations, MiCo\nintegrates a Cluster Reducer module, which consolidates redundant anchors while\nenhancing information exchange between distinct semantic groups.

Their low cost and power consumption\ncharacteristics confer high commercial value. However, their reasoning\nabilities are limited by the number of parameters. To address this issue, this\npaper proposes a post-training optimization paradigm called the Incremental\nTraining Strategy to enhance the reasoning ability of SVLMs. Firstly, we\nconstructed a Self-Supervised Chain-of-Thought (COT) Data Construction System,\nwhich leverages multiple LVLMs with 7B parameters or more to transform original\ndata into COT data in a self-supervised manner. Our proposed Incremental\nTraining Strategy consists of four stages. Stage 1 injects domain knowledge by\nperforming Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to the pretrained model on the COT\ndata. Stage 2 aligns the COT data format by conducting a small amount of Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training constrained only by format rewards\non the COT data. Stage 3 enhances reasoning ability by applying GRPO training\non the COT data with constraints on both format and accuracy rewards. The\nresulting model shows significant improvement compared to the baseline.

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which first predict a set of\nexplainable concepts from images and then perform classification based on these\nconcepts, are increasingly being adopted for explainable medical image\nclassification. However, the inherent explainability of CBMs introduces new\nchallenges when deploying trained models to new environments. Variations in\nimaging protocols and staining methods may induce concept-level shifts, such as\nalterations in color distribution and scale. Furthermore, since CBM training\nrequires explicit concept annotations, fine-tuning models solely with\nimage-level labels could compromise concept prediction accuracy and\nfaithfulness - a critical limitation given the high cost of acquiring\nexpert-annotated concept labels in medical domains.

While\ngenerative models show promise for data augmentation, current methods mainly\nfocus on enhancing polyp diversity, often overlooking the critical issue of\nfalse positives.

We further enhance the interaction of multimodal\nfeatures by incorporating multi-scale knowledge distillation across modalities.\nWe also demonstrate the practical feasibility of FMF-SLAM in real-world\nscenarios with real time performance by integrating it with a security robot by\nfusing with a global positioning module GNSS-RTK and global Bundle Adjustment.\nOur approach is validated using video sequences from TUM, TartanAir, and our\nreal-world datasets, showcasing state-of-the-art performance under noisy,\nvarying lighting, and dark conditions.Our code and datasets are available at\nhttps://github.com/youjie-zhou/FMF-SLAM.git.", "AI": {"tldr": "FMF-SLAM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408SLAM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5feb\u901f\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\uff08FFT\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u7b97\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u9ed1\u6697\u73af\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u6d41\u7684\u89c6\u89c9SLAM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u9ed1\u6697\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4eceRGB\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "\u5728TUM\u3001TartanAir\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u9ed1\u6697\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "FMF-SLAM\u901a\u8fc7FFT\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684SLAM\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

Ignoring frequency domain\ninformation will prevent the model from fully exploiting feature information,\nwhich would effect the classification performance. Based on conventional data\naugmentation, this paper proposes an SFIFNet with innovative data\npreprocessing. The key of this method is enhancing the accuracy of image\nfeature representation by integrating frequency domain information with spatial\ndomain information. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthis method in enhancing classification performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u9891\u57df\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u7684SFIFNet\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u9891\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e38\u89c4\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSFIFNet\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9891\u57df\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u9891\u57df\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Since the exact GCI fusion of two PMB\ndensities is intractable, we derive a principled approximation. Specifically,\nwe approximate the power of a PMB density as an unnormalised PMB density, which\ncorresponds to an upper bound of the PMB density. Then, the GCI fusion rule\ncorresponds to the normalised product of two unnormalised PMB densities.

We frame this challenge as Query-Evidence Asynchrony, where user\nqueries and their supporting evidence typically arrive asynchronously in the\nstreaming setting. This setting requires not only strong reasoning capabilities\nbut also the ability to retain past observations and respond to queries with\ntemporal awareness.

While effective in balanced settings, conventional KD suffers\nsignificantly when applied to long-tailed data distributions, as the teacher\nmodel tends to be biased toward head classes and provides limited supervision\nfor tail classes. In this paper, we propose Long-Tailed Knowledge Distillation\n(LTKD), a novel framework tailored for class-imbalanced scenarios. We begin by\nreformulating the standard KD objective into two components: inter-group and\nintra-group Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, corresponding to the prediction\ndistributions across and within class groups (head, medium, tail),\nrespectively. This decomposition allows us to identify and quantify the sources\nof teacher bias. To address them, we introduce (1) a rebalanced inter-group\nloss that calibrates the teacher's group-level predictions and (2) a uniform\nintra-group loss that ensures equal contribution from all groups during\ndistillation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100-LT, TinyImageNet-LT, and\nImageNet-LT show that LTKD consistently outperforms existing KD methods,\nachieving significant gains in both overall accuracy and tail-class\nperformance.

The primary challenges involve maintaining consistency across\nmultiple views and effectively synthesizing shapes and textures under diverse\nconditions. In this paper, we propose the Multi-View Auto-Regressive (MV-AR)\nmethod, which leverages an auto-regressive model to progressively generate\nconsistent multi-view images from arbitrary prompts. Firstly, the\nnext-token-prediction capability of the AR model significantly enhances its\neffectiveness in facilitating progressive multi-view synthesis.

Subsequently, we propose a unified model that\naccommodates various prompts via architecture designing and training\nstrategies. To address multiple conditions, we introduce condition injection\nmodules for text, camera pose, image, and shape. To manage multi-modal\nconditions simultaneously, a progressive training strategy is employed.

Existing encoder decoder based methods\ntypically compress inputs into low-dimensional bottlenecks on the assumption\nthat the compression process can effectively suppress the transmission of\nlogical anomalies to the decoder. However, logical anomalies present a\nparticular difficulty because, while their local features often resemble normal\nsemantics, their global semantics deviate significantly from normal patterns.\nThanks to the generalisation capabilities inherent in neural networks, these\nabnormal semantic features can propagate through low-dimensional bottlenecks.\nThis ultimately allows the decoder to reconstruct anomalous images with\nmisleading fidelity. To tackle the above challenge, we propose a novel\nnormality prior guided multi-semantic fusion network for unsupervised anomaly\ndetection. Instead of feeding the compressed bottlenecks to the decoder\ndirectly, we introduce the multi-semantic features of normal samples into the\nreconstruction process. To this end, we first extract abstract global semantics\nof normal cases by a pre-trained vision-language network, then the learnable\nsemantic codebooks are constructed to store representative feature vectors of\nnormal samples by vector quantisation.

Existing defenses have focused,\nimplicitly or explicitly, on single-patch attacks, leaving their sensitivity to\nthe number of patches as an open question or rendering them computationally\ninfeasible or inefficient against attacks consisting of multiple patches in the\nworst cases. In this work, we propose SpaNN, an attack detector whose\ncomputational complexity is independent of the expected number of adversarial\npatches. The key novelty of the proposed detector is that it builds an ensemble\nof binarized feature maps by applying a set of saliency thresholds to the\nneural activations of the first convolutional layer of the victim model.

The concept of\nrevocable biometrics was developed to address this concern. A biometric scheme\nis revocable if an individual can have their current enrollment in the scheme\nrevoked, so that the compromised biometric template becomes worthless, and the\nindividual can re-enroll with a new template that has similar recognition\npower. We show that modern deep CNN face matchers inherently allow for a robust\nrevocable biometric scheme. For a given state-of-the-art deep CNN backbone and\ntraining set, it is possible to generate an unlimited number of distinct face\nmatcher models that have both (1) equivalent recognition power, and (2)\nstrongly incompatible biometric templates. The equivalent recognition power\nextends to the point of generating impostor and genuine distributions that have\nthe same shape and placement on the similarity dimension, meaning that the\nmodels can share a similarity threshold for a 1-in-10,000 false match rate. The\nbiometric templates from different model instances are so strongly incompatible\nthat the cross-instance similarity score for images of the same person is\ntypically lower than the same-instance similarity score for images of different\npersons. That is, a stolen biometric template that is revoked is of less value\nin attempting to match the re-enrolled identity than the average impostor\ntemplate.

To address this gap,\nwe present 3D Arena, an open platform for evaluating image-to-3D generation\nmodels through large-scale human preference collection using pairwise\ncomparisons.\n  Since launching in June 2024, the platform has collected 123,243 votes from\n8,096 users across 19 state-of-the-art models, establishing the largest human\npreference evaluation for Generative 3D. We contribute the iso3d dataset of 100\nevaluation prompts and demonstrate quality control achieving 99.75% user\nauthenticity through statistical fraud detection. Our ELO-based ranking system\nprovides reliable model assessment, with the platform becoming an established\nevaluation resource.\n  Through analysis of this preference data, we present insights into human\npreference patterns. Our findings reveal preferences for visual presentation\nfeatures, with Gaussian splat outputs achieving a 16.6 ELO advantage over\nmeshes and textured models receiving a 144.1 ELO advantage over untextured\nmodels. We provide recommendations for improving evaluation methods, including\nmulti-criteria assessment, task-oriented evaluation, and format-aware\ncomparison.

Effective alignment between motion and musical beats\nenhances viewer engagement and visual appeal, particularly in music videos,\npromotional content, and cinematic editing. Existing methods typically depend\non labor-intensive manual cutting, speed adjustments, or heuristic-based\nediting techniques to achieve synchronization. While some generative models\nhandle joint video and music generation, they often entangle the two\nmodalities, limiting flexibility in aligning video to music beats while\npreserving the full visual content. In this paper, we propose a novel and\nefficient framework, termed MVAA (Music-Video Auto-Alignment), that\nautomatically edits video to align with the rhythm of a given music track while\npreserving the original visual content. To enhance flexibility, we modularize\nthe task into a two-step process in our MVAA: aligning motion keyframes with\naudio beats, followed by rhythm-aware video inpainting. Specifically, we first\ninsert keyframes at timestamps aligned with musical beats, then use a\nframe-conditioned diffusion model to generate coherent intermediate frames,\npreserving the original video's semantic content. Since comprehensive test-time\ntraining can be time-consuming, we adopt a two-stage strategy: pretraining the\ninpainting module on a small video set to learn general motion priors, followed\nby rapid inference-time fine-tuning for video-specific adaptation. This hybrid\napproach enables adaptation within 10 minutes with one epoch on a single NVIDIA\n4090 GPU using CogVideoX-5b-I2V as the backbone.

To address this, we introduce FilMaster, an end-to-end\nAI system that integrates real-world cinematic principles for\nprofessional-grade film generation, yielding editable, industry-standard\noutputs.

Inspired by these principles,\nFilMaster incorporates two stages: a Reference-Guided Generation Stage which\ntransforms user input to video clips, and a Generative Post-Production Stage\nwhich transforms raw footage into audiovisual outputs by orchestrating visual\nand auditory elements for cinematic rhythm. Our generation stage highlights a\nMulti-shot Synergized RAG Camera Language Design module to guide the AI in\ngenerating professional camera language by retrieving reference clips from a\nvast corpus of 440,000 film clips. Our post-production stage emulates\nprofessional workflows by designing an Audience-Centric Cinematic Rhythm\nControl module, including Rough Cut and Fine Cut processes informed by\nsimulated audience feedback, for effective integration of audiovisual elements\nto achieve engaging content. The system is empowered by generative AI models\nlike (M)LLMs and video generation models. Furthermore, we introduce FilmEval, a\ncomprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI-generated films.

By comparing expert and\nstudent gaze behavior through structured graphs, the system identifies missed\nfindings and assigns Perceptual Error Teacher agents to analyze discrepancies.\nMAARTA then uses step-by-step prompting to help students understand their\nerrors and improve diagnostic reasoning, advancing AI-driven radiology\neducation.", "AI": {"tldr": "MAARTA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u7ebf\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5b66\u751f\u6539\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u5b66\u751f\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\u65f6\u95f4\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u57f9\u517b\u611f\u77e5\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u89c9\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u89e3\u91ca\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u73b0\u6709AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "MAARTA\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u7ebf\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u56fe\u8868\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e0e\u5b66\u751f\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u914d\u611f\u77e5\u9519\u8bef\u6559\u5e08\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u9010\u6b65\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u9057\u6f0f\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5b66\u751f\u7406\u89e3\u9519\u8bef\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u8bca\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "MAARTA\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, prior work has focused on\nsolely the text portion of the bias rather than both the text and image\nportions. This is a problem because the images are just as powerful of a medium\nto communicate information as text is. To that end, we present a model that\nleverages both text and image bias which consists of four different steps.\nImage Text Alignment focuses on semantically aligning images based on their\nbias through CLIP models. Image Bias Scoring determines the appropriate bias\nscore of images via a ViT classifier. Text De-Biasing focuses on detecting\nbiased words and phrases and neutralizing them through BERT models. These three\nsteps all culminate to the final step of debiasing, which replaces the text and\nthe image with neutralized or reduced counterparts, which for images is done by\ncomparing the bias scores.

Furthermore, to\nmitigate the information loss introduced during quantization, we propose the\nQuantization Compensation Module (QCM), which learns the distribution of\nquantization errors and refines the quantized features to compensate for\nquantization loss. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate\nthat our method achieves superior compression efficiency compared to\nstate-of-the-art lossless image compression approaches, while maintaining\ncompetitive inference speed.

The project page:\n  https://github.com/deep-optimization/Morse", "summary": "In this paper, we present Morse, a simple dual-sampling framework for\naccelerating diffusion models losslessly. The key insight of Morse is to\nreformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking\nadvantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies.\nSpecifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with\neach other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type,\nbut operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling\nefficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash\nmodel, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the\nobservations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash\nmodel, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the\nDash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot\nmodels run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly\nattaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime\nefficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot\nmodels, Morse is efficient for training and inference.

Additionally, pre-processing of the input retinal fundus\nimage is performed by Global Contrast Normalization (GCN), Contrast Limited\nAdaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and gamma corrections to increase\nintensity uniformity as well as to enhance the contrast between vessels and\nbackground pixels. The resulting balanced dataset is used for\nclassification-based segmentation of the retinal vascular tree. We evaluate the\nproposed scheme on standard retinal fundus images and achieve superior\nperformance measures, including an area under the ROC curve of 98.23%, Accuracy\nof 96.22%, Sensitivity of 81.57%, and Specificity of 97.65%.

Our first stage\nutilizes a VQ-VAE that hierarchically separates high-level semantic features at\na coarse temporal resolution from low-level details at a finer resolution,\nproducing two discrete token sequences at different abstraction levels.\nSubsequently, in the second stage, two generative masked transformers learn to\nmap music signals to these dance tokens: the first producing high-level\nsemantic tokens, and the second, conditioned on music and these semantic\ntokens, producing the low-level tokens. We train both transformers to learn to\npredict randomly masked tokens within the sequence, enabling them to\niteratively generate motion tokens by filling an empty token sequence during\ninference.

This is particularly\nbeneficial for breast imaging, where long acquisition times and high cost are\nsignificantly limiting the applicability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as\na widespread screening modality. Recent studies have demonstrated the\nfeasibility of synthetic contrast generation. However, current state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) methods lack sufficient measures for consistent temporal evolution.\nNeural cellular automata (NCA) offer a robust and lightweight architecture to\nmodel evolving patterns between neighboring cells or pixels. In this work we\nintroduce TeNCA (Temporal Neural Cellular Automata), which extends and further\nrefines NCAs to effectively model temporally sparse, non-uniformly sampled\nimaging data. To achieve this, we advance the training strategy by enabling\nadaptive loss computation and define the iterative nature of the method to\nresemble a physical progression in time. This conditions the model to learn a\nphysiologically plausible evolution of contrast enhancement.

Additionally, we share valuable lessons learned\nfrom deploying the backpack over more than 25 km across various environments.\nOur code and dataset are available online at this link:\nhttps://github.com/norlab-ulaval/TFR24 BorealHDR", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u66dd\u5149\u65f6\u95f4\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u66dd\u5149\uff08AE\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u57fa\u4e8eBorealHDR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u4e8e1.78%\u7684RMSE\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178AE\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfAE\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u96be\u4ee5\u590d\u73b0\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e5f\u56e0\u56fa\u5b9a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u53c2\u6570\u800c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528BorealHDR\u591a\u66dd\u5149\u7acb\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u66dd\u5149\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30AE\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684RMSE\u4f4e\u4e8e1.78%\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178AE\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u590d\u73b0\u6027\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178AE\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

Multi-agent Gaussian SLAM is a promising\napproach to rapid exploration and reconstruction of environments, offering\nscalable environment representations, but existing approaches are limited to\nsmall-scale, indoor environments. To that end, we propose Gaussian\nReconstruction via Multi-Agent Dense SLAM, or GRAND-SLAM, a collaborative\nGaussian splatting SLAM method that integrates i) an implicit tracking module\nbased on local optimization over submaps and ii) an approach to inter- and\nintra-robot loop closure integrated into a pose-graph optimization framework.\nExperiments show that GRAND-SLAM provides state-of-the-art tracking performance\nand 28% higher PSNR than existing methods on the Replica indoor dataset, as\nwell as 91% lower multi-agent tracking error and improved rendering over\nexisting multi-agent methods on the large-scale, outdoor Kimera-Multi dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "GRAND-SLAM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85SLAM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6237\u5916\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u4f4d\u59ff\u56fe\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85SLAM\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6237\u5916\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5ba4\u5185\u73af\u5883\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGRAND-SLAM\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u4f4d\u59ff\u56fe\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728Replica\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aPSNR\u63d0\u534728%\uff0c\u5728Kimera-Multi\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e91%\uff0c\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GRAND-SLAM\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u5feb\u901f\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
