Its task form is to guide the models to track the objects that\nconform to the language instruction. However, the RMOT task commonly requires\nclear language instructions, such methods often fail to work when complex\nlanguage instructions with reasoning characteristics appear. In this work, we\npropose a new task, called Reasoning-based Multi-Object Tracking (ReaMOT).\nReaMOT is a more challenging task that requires accurate reasoning about\nobjects that match the language instruction with reasoning characteristic and\ntracking the objects' trajectories. To advance the ReaMOT task and evaluate the\nreasoning capabilities of tracking models, we construct ReaMOT Challenge, a\nreasoning-based multi-object tracking benchmark built upon 12 datasets.\nSpecifically, it comprises 1,156 language instructions with reasoning\ncharacteristic, 423,359 image-language pairs, and 869 diverse scenes, which is\ndivided into three levels of reasoning difficulty. In addition, we propose a\nset of evaluation metrics tailored for the ReaMOT task. Furthermore, we propose\nReaTrack, a training-free framework for reasoning-based multi-object tracking\nbased on large vision-language models (LVLM) and SAM2, as a baseline for the\nReaMOT task.

These inconsistencies, when propagated via\nprojection supervision, deteriorate the quality of 3D Gaussian semantic fields\nand introduce artifacts in the rendered outputs. To mitigate this limitation,\nwe propose CCL-LGS, a novel framework that enforces view-consistent semantic\nsupervision by integrating multi-view semantic cues. Specifically, our approach\nfirst employs a zero-shot tracker to align a set of SAM-generated 2D masks and\nreliably identify their corresponding categories.

Finally, our Contrastive\nCodebook Learning (CCL) module distills discriminative semantic features by\nenforcing intra-class compactness and inter-class distinctiveness.

For weather background editing, we\nintroduce an all-in-one adapter that integrates multiple weather styles into a\nsingle pretrained diffusion model, enabling the generation of diverse weather\neffects in 2D image backgrounds. During inference, we design a Temporal-View\n(TV-) attention mechanism that follows a specific order to aggregate temporal\nand spatial information, ensuring consistent editing across multi-frame and\nmulti-view images. To construct the weather particles, we first reconstruct a\n3D scene using the edited images and then introduce a dynamic 4D Gaussian field\nto generate snowflakes, raindrops and fog in the scene. The attributes and\ndynamics of these particles are precisely controlled through physical-based\nmodelling and simulation, ensuring realistic weather representation and\nflexible severity adjustments. Finally, we integrate the 4D Gaussian field with\nthe 3D scene to render consistent and highly realistic weather effects.\nExperiments on multiple driving datasets demonstrate that WeatherEdit can\ngenerate diverse weather effects with controllable condition severity,\nhighlighting its potential for autonomous driving simulation in adverse\nweather.

This framework enables accurate\nappearance, geometry, and panoptic reconstruction of diverse indoor scenes\ncaptured by a consumer-level RGB-D camera. Since 3DGS is primarily optimized\nfor photorealistic rendering, it lacks the precise geometry critical for\nhigh-quality panoptic reconstruction. Therefore, OmniIndoor3D first combines\nmultiple RGB-D images to create a coarse 3D reconstruction, which is then used\nto initialize the 3D Gaussians and guide the 3DGS training. To decouple the\noptimization conflict between appearance and geometry, we introduce a\nlightweight MLP that adjusts the geometric properties of 3D Gaussians. The\nintroduced lightweight MLP serves as a low-pass filter for geometry\nreconstruction and significantly reduces noise in indoor scenes. To improve the\ndistribution of Gaussian primitives, we propose a densification strategy guided\nby panoptic priors to encourage smoothness on planar surfaces. Through the\njoint optimization of appearance, geometry, and panoptic reconstruction,\nOmniIndoor3D provides comprehensive 3D indoor scene understanding, which\nfacilitates accurate and robust robotic navigation. We perform thorough\nevaluations across multiple datasets, and OmniIndoor3D achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in appearance, geometry, and panoptic reconstruction.\nWe believe our work bridges a critical gap in indoor 3D reconstruction.

To\naddress these issues, we propose the Mamba-Driven Topology Fusion framework in\nthis paper. Specifically, the proposed Bone Aware Module infers the direction\nand length of bone vectors in the spherical coordinate system, providing\neffective topological guidance for the Mamba model in processing joint\nsequences. Furthermore, we enhance the convolutional structure within the Mamba\nmodel by integrating forward and backward graph convolutional network, enabling\nit to better capture local joint dependencies. Finally, we design a\nSpatiotemporal Refinement Module to model both temporal and spatial\nrelationships within the sequence. Through the incorporation of skeletal\ntopology, our approach effectively alleviates Mamba's limitations in capturing\nhuman structural relationships.

Predicting\nwhether individuals with OSA will develop hypertension within five years\nremains a complex challenge. This study introduces a novel deep learning\napproach that integrates Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)-based transfer\nlearning to enhance prediction accuracy. We are the first to incorporate all\npolysomnography signals together for hypertension prediction, leveraging their\ncollective information to improve model performance. Features were extracted\nfrom these signals and transformed into a 2D representation to utilize\npre-trained 2D neural networks such as MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ResNet\nvariants. To further improve feature learning, we introduced a DCT layer, which\ntransforms input features into a frequency-based representation, preserving\nessential spectral information, decorrelating features, and enhancing\nrobustness to noise. This frequency-domain approach, coupled with transfer\nlearning, is especially beneficial for limited medical datasets, as it\nleverages rich representations from pre-trained networks to improve\ngeneralization.

This study compares two objective\nskin tone classification methods: the widely used Individual Typology Angle\n(ITA) and a perceptually grounded alternative based on Lightness ($L^*$) and\nHue ($H^*$). Using AffectNet and a MobileNet-based model, we assess fairness\nacross skin tone groups defined by each method. Results reveal a severe\nunderrepresentation of dark skin tones ($\\sim 2 \\%$), alongside fairness\ndisparities in F1-score (up to 0.08) and TPR (up to 0.11) across groups. While\nITA shows limitations due to its sensitivity to lighting, the $H^*$-$L^*$\nmethod yields more consistent subgrouping and enables clearer diagnostics\nthrough metrics such as Equal Opportunity.

Existing vision-based\nmethods perform well on daytime benchmarks but struggle in nighttime scenarios\ndue to limited visibility and challenging lighting conditions. To address these\nchallenges, we propose \\textbf{LIAR}, a novel framework that learns\nillumination-affined representations. LIAR first introduces Selective Low-light\nImage Enhancement (SLLIE), which leverages the illumination priors from daytime\nscenes to adaptively determine whether a nighttime image is genuinely dark or\nsufficiently well-lit, enabling more targeted global enhancement. Building on\nthe illumination maps generated by SLLIE, LIAR further incorporates two\nillumination-aware components: 2D Illumination-guided Sampling (2D-IGS) and 3D\nIllumination-driven Projection (3D-IDP), to respectively tackle local\nunderexposure and overexposure. Specifically, 2D-IGS modulates feature sampling\npositions according to illumination maps, assigning larger offsets to darker\nregions and smaller ones to brighter regions, thereby alleviating feature\ndegradation in underexposed areas. Subsequently, 3D-IDP enhances semantic\nunderstanding in overexposed regions by constructing illumination intensity\nfields and supplying refined residual queries to the BEV context refinement\nprocess.

Users can specify a multi-track timeline of facial actions arranged in\ntemporal intervals, allowing precise control over the timing of each action. To\nmodel the timeline control capability, We first annotate the time intervals of\nfacial actions in natural facial motion sequences at a frame-level granularity.\nThis process is facilitated by Toeplitz Inverse Covariance-based Clustering to\nminimize human labor. Based on the annotations, we propose a diffusion-based\ngeneration model capable of generating facial motions that are natural and\naccurately aligned with input timelines. Our method supports text-guided motion\ngeneration by using ChatGPT to convert text into timelines.

To address this, various contrastive decoding (CD) methods have been\nproposed that contrasts original logits with hallucinated logits generated from\nperturbed inputs. While CD has shown promise in vision-language models (VLMs),\nit is not well-suited for AV-LLMs, where hallucinations often emerge from both\nunimodal and cross-modal combinations involving audio, video, and language.\nThese intricate interactions call for a more adaptive and modality-aware\ndecoding strategy. In this paper, we propose Audio-Visual Contrastive Decoding\n(AVCD)-a novel, training-free decoding framework designed to model trimodal\ninteractions and suppress modality-induced hallucinations in AV-LLMs. Unlike\nprevious CD methods in VLMs that corrupt a fixed modality, AVCD leverages\nattention distributions to dynamically identify less dominant modalities and\napplies attentive masking to generate perturbed output logits. To support CD in\na trimodal setting, we also reformulate the original CD framework to jointly\nhandle audio, visual, and textual inputs. Finally, to improve efficiency, we\nintroduce entropy-guided adaptive decoding, which selectively skips unnecessary\ndecoding steps based on the model's confidence in its predictions. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that AVCD consistently outperforms existing decoding\nmethods.

To\naddress the inherent decoupling between reconstruction and stylization, we\nintroduce a branched architecture that separates structure modeling and\nappearance shading, effectively preventing stylistic transfer from distorting\nthe underlying 3D scene structure. Furthermore, we adapt an identity loss to\nfacilitate pre-training our stylization model through the novel view synthesis\ntask. This strategy also allows our model to retain its original reconstruction\ncapabilities while being fine-tuned for stylization. Comprehensive evaluations,\nusing both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, demonstrate that our approach\nproduces high-quality stylized 3D content that achieve a superior blend of\nstyle and scene appearance, while also outperforming existing methods in terms\nof multi-view consistency and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5feb\u901f3D\u573a\u666f\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u652f\u67b6\u6784\u5206\u79bb\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5916\u89c2\u7740\u8272\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u67093D\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bc6\u96c6\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u652f\u67b6\u6784\u5206\u79bb\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8eab\u4efd\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u4efb\u610f\u98ce\u683c\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u63013D\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u98ce\u683c\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We show that t-related Lagrange interpolation is\nsuboptimal for diffusion model and reveal a compact search space comprised of\ntime steps and solver coefficients. Building on our analysis, we propose a\nnovel differentiable solver search algorithm to identify more optimal solver.\nEquipped with the searched solver, rectified-flow models, e.g., SiT-XL/2 and\nFlowDCN-XL/2, achieve FID scores of 2.40 and 2.35, respectively, on ImageNet256\nwith only 10 steps. Meanwhile, DDPM model, DiT-XL/2, reaches a FID score of\n2.33 with only 10 steps. Notably, our searched solver outperforms traditional\nsolvers by a significant margin. Moreover, our searched solver demonstrates\ngenerality across various model architectures, resolutions, and model sizes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4ec5\u970010\u6b65\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfODE\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4f9d\u8d56\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u4f18\u5316\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7cfb\u6570\u6784\u5efa\u7d27\u51d1\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u4f18\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet256\u4e0a\uff0cSiT-XL/2\u548cFlowDCN-XL/2\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u5230FID 2.40\u548c2.35\uff0cDiT-XL/2\u8fbe\u52302.33\uff0c\u5747\u4ec5\u970010\u6b65\u3002", "conclusion": "\u641c\u7d22\u5230\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u3002"}}

Additionally, pose sequences often contain\nsignificant redundancy between frames. However, recent methods typically fail\nto improve model capacity while effectively eliminating sequence redundancy. In\nthis work, we introduce the Spectral Compression Transformer (SCT) to reduce\nsequence length and accelerate computation. The SCT encoder treats hidden\nfeatures between blocks as Temporal Feature Signals (TFS) and applies the\nDiscrete Cosine Transform, a Fourier transform-based technique, to determine\nthe spectral components to be retained. By filtering out certain high-frequency\nnoise components, SCT compresses the sequence length and reduces redundancy.

To address these issues, we propose\nACTIVE-O3, a purely reinforcement learning based training framework built on\ntop of GRPO, designed to equip MLLMs with active perception capabilities. We\nfurther establish a comprehensive benchmark suite to evaluate ACTIVE-O3 across\nboth general open-world tasks, such as small-object and dense object grounding,\nand domain-specific scenarios, including small object detection in remote\nsensing and autonomous driving, as well as fine-grained interactive\nsegmentation. In addition, ACTIVE-O3 also demonstrates strong zero-shot\nreasoning abilities on the V* Benchmark, without relying on any explicit\nreasoning data. We hope that our work can provide a simple codebase and\nevaluation protocol to facilitate future research on active perception in\nMLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faACTIVE-O3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8d4b\u4e88\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1MLLMs\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eGRPO\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6ACTIVE-O3\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "ACTIVE-O3\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ACTIVE-O3\u4e3aMLLMs\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u548c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u534f\u8bae\u3002"}}

Our fully open-source variants (e.g. based on the\nQwen-2.5 series) outperform existing 4o-driven multi-agent systems across\nnearly all metrics, while using 87% fewer tokens.

Our model is trained\nusing the text prompt, which defines the shape class and characterizes the\nappearance and fine-grained style of the generated details. The coarse 3D\nproxy, which can be easily varied and adjusted (e.g., via user editing),\nprovides structure control over the final shape. Importantly, our detailizer is\nnot optimized for a single shape; it is the result of distilling a generative\nmodel, so that it can be reused, without retraining, to generate any number of\nshapes, with varied structures, whose local details all share a consistent\nstyle and appearance. Our detailizer training utilizes a pretrained multi-view\nimage diffusion model, with text conditioning, to distill the foundational\nknowledge therein into our detailizer via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). To\nimprove SDS and enable our detailizer architecture to learn generalizable\nfeatures over complex structures, we train our model in two training stages to\ngenerate shapes with increasing structural complexity.

On the\nCIFAR10 generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves record-breaking Frechet\nInception Distance (FID) values of \\textbf{\\emph{1.46}} for unconditional\ngeneration and \\textbf{\\emph{1.38}} for conditional generation. On the\nImageNet-$64\\times 64$ generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves a new SoTA\none-step generation FID of \\textbf{\\emph{1.02}}, which outperforms its 79-step\nteacher diffusion with a significant improvement margin of 1.33 (1.02 vs 2.35).\nWe also apply Uni-Instruct on broader tasks like text-to-3D generation. For\ntext-to-3D generation, Uni-Instruct gives decent results, which slightly\noutperforms previous methods, such as SDS and VSD, in terms of both generation\nquality and diversity.

We investigated whether artificial\nintelligence (AI) interpretation of micro-US can outperform clinical screening\nmethods using PSA and digital rectal examination (DRE). Methods: We\nretrospectively studied 145 men who underwent micro-US guided biopsy (79 with\ncsPCa, 66 without). A self-supervised convolutional autoencoder was used to\nextract deep image features from 2D micro-US slices. Random forest classifiers\nwere trained using five-fold cross-validation to predict csPCa at the slice\nlevel. Patients were classified as csPCa-positive if 88 or more consecutive\nslices were predicted positive. Model performance was compared with a\nclassifier using PSA, DRE, prostate volume, and age. Key findings and\nlimitations: The AI-based micro-US model and clinical screening model achieved\nAUROCs of 0.871 and 0.753, respectively.

The core challenges are\ntwofold. First, achieving realistic whole-body motion requires tight\ncoordination between the hands and the rest of the body, as their movements are\ninterdependent during manipulation. Second, articulated object manipulation\ntypically involves high degrees of freedom and demands higher precision, often\nrequiring the fingers to be placed at specific regions to actuate movable\nparts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel coordinated diffusion\nnoise optimization framework. Specifically, we perform noise-space optimization\nover three specialized diffusion models for the body, left hand, and right\nhand, each trained on its own motion dataset to improve generalization.\nCoordination naturally emerges through gradient flow along the human kinematic\nchain, allowing the global body posture to adapt in response to hand motion\nobjectives with high fidelity. To further enhance precision in hand-object\ninteraction, we adopt a unified representation based on basis point sets (BPS),\nwhere end-effector positions are encoded as distances to the same BPS used for\nobject geometry. This unified representation captures fine-grained spatial\nrelationships between the hand and articulated object parts, and the resulting\ntrajectories serve as targets to guide the optimization of diffusion noise,\nproducing highly accurate interaction motion. We conduct extensive experiments\ndemonstrating that our method outperforms existing approaches in motion quality\nand physical plausibility, and enables various capabilities such as object pose\ncontrol, simultaneous walking and manipulation, and whole-body generation from\nhand-only data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u534f\u8c03\u6269\u6563\u566a\u58f0\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u5168\u8eab\u64cd\u7eb5\u5173\u8282\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8eab\u4f53\u3001\u624b\u90e8\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u534f\u8c03\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u8eab\u64cd\u7eb5\u5173\u8282\u7269\u4f53\u5728\u865a\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u534f\u8c03\u8eab\u4f53\u4e0e\u624b\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7cbe\u786e\u64cd\u4f5c\u662f\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e13\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u8eab\u4f53\u3001\u5de6\u624b\u3001\u53f3\u624b\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u566a\u58f0\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u5b9e\u73b0\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528BPS\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u589e\u5f3a\u624b-\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u529f\u80fd\u5982\u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u884c\u8d70\u4e0e\u64cd\u7eb5\u540c\u6b65\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5168\u8eab\u64cd\u7eb5\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u4e0e\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}
