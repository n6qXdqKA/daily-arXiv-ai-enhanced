We find\nsuch emergent behaviors in biological vision models via large-scale contrastive\nvision-language training. To achieve this, we first curate TreeOfLife-200M,\ncomprising 214 million images of living organisms, the largest and most diverse\nbiological organism image dataset to date. We then train BioCLIP 2 on\nTreeOfLife-200M to distinguish different species. Despite the narrow training\nobjective, BioCLIP 2 yields extraordinary accuracy when applied to various\nbiological visual tasks such as habitat classification and trait prediction. We\nidentify emergent properties in the learned embedding space of BioCLIP 2. At\nthe inter-species level, the embedding distribution of different species aligns\nclosely with functional and ecological meanings (e.g., beak sizes and\nhabitats). At the intra-species level, instead of being diminished, the\nintra-species variations (e.g., life stages and sexes) are preserved and better\nseparated in subspaces orthogonal to inter-species distinctions. We provide\nformal proof and analyses to explain why hierarchical supervision and\ncontrastive objectives encourage these emergent properties.

This can be\nattributed to both the comparatively smaller scale of 3D datasets, as well as\nthe disparate sources of the data itself. Point clouds are captured by diverse\nsensors (e.g., depth cameras, LiDAR) across varied domains (e.g., indoor,\noutdoor), each introducing unique scanning patterns, sampling densities, and\nsemantic biases. Such domain heterogeneity poses a major barrier towards\ntraining unified models at scale, especially under the realistic constraint\nthat domain labels are typically inaccessible at inference time. In this work,\nwe propose Point-MoE, a Mixture-of-Experts architecture designed to enable\nlarge-scale, cross-domain generalization in 3D perception. We show that\nstandard point cloud backbones degrade significantly in performance when\ntrained on mixed-domain data, whereas Point-MoE with a simple top-k routing\nstrategy can automatically specialize experts, even without access to domain\nlabels. Our experiments demonstrate that Point-MoE not only outperforms strong\nmulti-domain baselines but also generalizes better to unseen domains.

However, the complex and sparse nature of observational data,\nparticularly information about the bed topography under the ice sheet,\nsignificantly increases the uncertainty in model projections. Bed topography is\ntraditionally measured by airborne ice-penetrating radar that measures the ice\nthickness directly underneath the aircraft, leaving data gap of tens of\nkilometers in between flight lines.

Among all efforts to reconstruct bed topography,\nBedMachine has emerged as one of the most widely used datasets, combining mass\nconservation principles and ice thickness measurements to generate\nhigh-resolution bed elevation estimates. The proposed loss function adaptively\nadjusts the weighting between radar and BedMachine data, ensuring robustness in\nareas with limited radar coverage while leveraging the high spatial resolution\nof BedMachine predictions i.e. bed estimates.

By computing depth gradients from depth maps, our\nmethod captures spatial transitions that help resolve texture ambiguities.\nThese gradients, through a cross-attention mechanism, refines RGB feature\nrepresentations, resulting in sharper boundary delineation. In addition, we\npropose a geometry-aware masking strategy that applies horizontal, vertical,\nand stochastic masks during training. This encourages the model to focus on the\nbroader spatial context for robust visual recognition. Evaluations on real\nagricultural datasets demonstrate that MaskAdapt consistently outperforms\nexisting State-of-the-Art (SOTA) UDA methods, achieving improved segmentation\nmean Intersection over Union (mIOU) across diverse field conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "MaskAdapt\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f5c\u7269\u4e0e\u6742\u8349\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u519c\u7530\u7684\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5206\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u53d6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5316RGB\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u519c\u7530\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMaskAdapt\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u5272mIOU\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "MaskAdapt\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f5c\u7269\u4e0e\u6742\u8349\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Existing approaches rely on Vision-Language-Action\n(VLA) models to acquire bimanual policies. However, transferring knowledge from\nsingle-arm datasets or pre-trained VLA models often fails to generalize\neffectively, primarily due to the scarcity of bimanual data and the fundamental\ndifferences between single-arm and bimanual manipulation. In this paper, we\npropose a novel bimanual foundation policy by fine-tuning the leading\ntext-to-video models to predict robot trajectories and training a lightweight\ndiffusion policy for action generation. Given the lack of embodied knowledge in\ntext-to-video models, we introduce a two-stage paradigm that fine-tunes\nindependent text-to-flow and flow-to-video models derived from a pre-trained\ntext-to-video model. Specifically, optical flow serves as an intermediate\nvariable, providing a concise representation of subtle movements between\nimages.

Traditional uniform sampling often leads to\nselection of irrelevant content, while post-training MLLMs on thousands of\nframes imposes a substantial computational burden. In this paper, we propose\nthreading keyframes with narratives (Nar-KFC), a plug-and-play module to\nfacilitate effective and efficient long video perception. Nar-KFC generally\ninvolves two collaborative steps. First, we formulate the keyframe selection\nprocess as an integer quadratic programming problem, jointly optimizing\nquery-relevance and frame-diversity. To avoid its computational complexity, a\ncustomized greedy search strategy is designed as an efficient alternative.\nSecond, to mitigate the temporal discontinuity caused by sparse keyframe\nsampling, we further introduce interleaved textual narratives generated from\nnon-keyframes using off-the-shelf captioners. These narratives are inserted\nbetween keyframes based on their true temporal order, forming a coherent and\ncompact representation. Nar-KFC thus serves as a temporal- and content-aware\ncompression strategy that complements visual and textual modalities.\nExperimental results on multiple long-video benchmarks demonstrate that Nar-KFC\nsignificantly improves the performance of popular MLLMs. Code will be made\npublicly available.", "AI": {"tldr": "Nar-KFC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u53d9\u4e8b\u63d2\u5165\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u8fc7\u591a\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u8fc7\u591a\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u6216\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "method": "Nar-KFC\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u6570\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u4f18\u5316\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5e76\u63d2\u5165\u975e\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u672c\u53d9\u4e8b\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cNar-KFC\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Nar-KFC\u4e3a\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

To rigorously evaluate this\ncapability, we introduce MVPBench, a curated benchmark designed to rigorously\nevaluate visual physical reasoning through the lens of visual chain-of-thought\n(CoT). Each example features interleaved multi-image inputs and demands not\nonly the correct final answer but also a coherent, step-by-step reasoning path\ngrounded in evolving visual cues. This setup mirrors how humans reason through\nreal-world physical processes over time. To ensure fine-grained evaluation, we\nintroduce a graph-based CoT consistency metric that verifies whether the\nreasoning path of model adheres to valid physical logic. Additionally, we\nminimize shortcut exploitation from text priors, encouraging models to rely on\nvisual understanding. Experimental results reveal a concerning trend: even\ncutting-edge MLLMs exhibit poor visual reasoning accuracy and weak image-text\nalignment in physical domains. Surprisingly, RL-based post-training alignment -\ncommonly believed to improve visual reasoning performance - often harms spatial\nreasoning, suggesting a need to rethink current fine-tuning practices.", "AI": {"tldr": "MVPBench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u89c6\u89c9\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793aMLLMs\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165MVPBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff08CoT\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56fe\u5f0f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6307\u6807\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63a8\u7406\u903b\u8f91\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5373\u4f7f\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684MLLMs\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dMLLMs\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This paper\nintroduces Self-Improved Privilege Learning (SIPL), a novel paradigm that\novercomes these limitations by innovatively extending the utility of privileged\ninformation (PI) beyond training into the inference stage. Unlike conventional\nPrivilege Learning, where ground-truth-derived guidance is typically discarded\nafter training, SIPL empowers the model to leverage its own preliminary outputs\nas pseudo-privileged signals for iterative self-refinement at test time.\nCentral to SIPL is Proxy Fusion, a lightweight module incorporating a learnable\nPrivileged Dictionary. During training, this dictionary distills essential\nhigh-frequency and structural priors from privileged feature representations.\nCritically, at inference, the same learned dictionary then interacts with\nfeatures derived from the model's initial restoration, facilitating a\nself-correction loop. SIPL can be seamlessly integrated into various backbone\narchitectures, offering substantial performance improvements with minimal\ncomputational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIPL\nsignificantly advances the state-of-the-art on diverse all-in-one image\nrestoration benchmarks. For instance, when integrated with the PromptIR model,\nSIPL achieves remarkable PSNR improvements of +4.58 dB on composite degradation\ntasks and +1.28 dB on diverse five-task benchmarks, underscoring its\neffectiveness and broad applicability.

Because high-quality generations with\nDMs typically require a large number of function evaluations (NFEs), resulting\nin slow sampling, there has been extensive research successfully reducing the\nNFE to a small range (<10) while maintaining acceptable image quality. However,\nmany practical applications, such as those involving Stable Diffusion 3.5,\nFLUX, and SANA, commonly operate in the mid-NFE regime (20-50 NFE) to achieve\nsuperior results, and, despite the practical relevance, research on the\neffective sampling within this mid-NFE regime remains underexplored.

This LML approximated Hessian geometry enables the\ndiffusion sampling to execute more accurate steps and improve the image\ngeneration quality.

However, existing methods\nstruggle with 1) limited generalization across patient cases due to scarce\nlabeled data, and 2) poor robustness under visual degradation, as bronchoscopy\nprocedures frequently involve artifacts such as occlusions and motion blur that\nimpair visual information. To address these challenges, we propose PANSv2, a\ngeneralizable and robust bronchoscopy localization framework. Motivated by PANS\nthat leverages multiple visual cues for pose likelihood measurement, PANSv2\nintegrates depth estimation, landmark detection, and centerline constraints\ninto a unified pose optimization framework that evaluates pose probability and\nsolves for the optimal bronchoscope pose. To further enhance generalization\ncapabilities, we leverage the endoscopic foundation model EndoOmni for depth\nestimation and the video foundation model EndoMamba for landmark detection,\nincorporating both spatial and temporal analyses.

To verify the effectiveness of\nthe model, we conducted EEG-to-image generation and classification tasks using\nthe THINGS-EEG dataset. To address the limitations of quantitative analysis at\nthe semantic level, we combined WordNet-based classification and semantic\nsimilarity metrics to propose a novel semantic-based score, emphasizing the\nability of our model to transfer neural activities into visual representations.\nExperimental results show that our model significantly improves semantic\nalignment and classification accuracy, which achieves a maximum single-subject\naccuracy of 43\\%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

The combination of these\nmulti-modal data enhances environmental perception by providing 3D spatial\ncontext, which is absent in standard RGB images. Although RGBD multi-modal data\ncan be available to train computer vision models, accessing all sensor\nmodalities during the inference stage may be infeasible due to sensor failures\nor resource constraints, leading to a mismatch between data modalities\navailable during training and inference. Traditional Cross-Modal Knowledge\nDistillation (CMKD) frameworks, developed to address this task, are typically\nbased on a teacher/student paradigm, where a multi-modal teacher distills\nknowledge into a single-modality student model. However, these approaches face\nchallenges in teacher architecture choices and distillation process selection,\nthus limiting their adoption in real-world scenarios. To overcome these issues,\nwe introduce CroDiNo-KD (Cross-Modal Disentanglement: a New Outlook on\nKnowledge Distillation), a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework\nfor RGBD semantic segmentation.

With the rise of Transformer\narchitectures, there is an increasing need for larger datasets to boost\nperformance.

Previous pseudo label generation methods heavily rely on\nhuman-labeled captions of the original dataset, limiting scalability and\ndiversity. To address this, we propose D2AF, a robust annotation framework for\nvisual grounding using only input images. This approach overcomes dataset size\nlimitations and enriches both the quantity and diversity of referring\nexpressions. Our approach leverages multimodal large models and object\ndetection models. By implementing dual-driven annotation strategies, we\neffectively generate detailed region-text pairs using both closed-set and\nopen-set approaches. We further conduct an in-depth analysis of data quantity\nand data distribution. Our findings demonstrate that increasing data volume\nenhances model performance. However, the degree of improvement depends on how\nwell the pseudo labels broaden the original data distribution.

Compared with general image classification tasks, FBIC poses\nmore formidable challenges: 1) the differences in species size and imaging\ndistance result in the varying sizes of birds presented in the images; 2)\ncomplex natural habitats often introduce strong background interference; 3) and\nhighly flexible poses such as flying, perching, or foraging result in\nsubstantial intra-class variability. These factors collectively make it\ndifficult for traditional methods to stably extract discriminative features,\nthereby limiting the generalizability and interpretability of models in\nreal-world applications. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a\nfine-grained bird classification framework based on strip-aware spatial\nperception, which aims to capture long-range spatial dependencies across entire\nrows or columns in bird images, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and\ninterpretability.

However, existing methods typically require training\na bridge model from scratch for each specific type of degradation, resulting in\nhigh computational costs and limited performance. This work aims to efficiently\nleverage pretrained generative priors within existing image restoration bridges\nto eliminate this requirement. The main challenge is that standard generative\nmodels are typically designed for a diffusion process that starts from pure\nnoise, while restoration tasks begin with a low-quality image, resulting in a\nmismatch in the state distributions between the two processes. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a transition equation that bridges two diffusion\nprocesses with the same endpoint distribution.

The outliers are treated as noise, considerably degrading\nthe performance of SSL models. To address this drawback, we propose a novel\nframework, Diversify and Conquer (DAC), to enhance SSL robustness in the\ncontext of open-set semi-supervised learning. In particular, we note that\nexisting open-set SSL methods rely on prediction discrepancies between inliers\nand outliers from a single model trained on labeled data. This approach can be\neasily failed when the labeled data is insufficient, leading to performance\ndegradation that is worse than naive SSL that do not account for outliers. In\ncontrast, our approach exploits prediction disagreements among multiple models\nthat are differently biased towards the unlabeled distribution. By leveraging\nthe discrepancies arising from training on unlabeled data, our method enables\nrobust outlier detection even when the labeled data is underspecified.

While many recent works aim to improve this framework by\ndesigning more powerful encoders and decoders, employing advanced convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) for local feature extraction, Transformers or state\nspace models (SSMs) such as Mamba for global context modeling, or hybrid\ncombinations of both, these methods often struggle to fully utilize pretrained\nvision backbones (e.g., ResNet, ViT, VMamba) due to structural mismatches. To\nbridge this gap, we introduce ACM-UNet, a general-purpose segmentation\nframework that retains a simple UNet-like design while effectively\nincorporating pretrained CNNs and Mamba models through a lightweight adapter\nmechanism. This adapter resolves architectural incompatibilities and enables\nthe model to harness the complementary strengths of CNNs and SSMs-namely,\nfine-grained local detail extraction and long-range dependency modeling.\nAdditionally, we propose a hierarchical multi-scale wavelet transform module in\nthe decoder to enhance feature fusion and reconstruction fidelity.

However, recent\nworks indicate that CLIP falls short in distinguishing detailed differences in\nimages and shows suboptimal performance on dense-prediction and vision-centric\nmultimodal tasks. Therefore, this work focuses on improving existing CLIP\nmodels, aiming to capture as many visual details in images as possible. We find\nthat a specific type of generative models, unCLIP, provides a suitable\nframework for achieving our goal. Specifically, unCLIP trains an image\ngenerator conditioned on the CLIP image embedding. In other words, it inverts\nthe CLIP image encoder. Compared to discriminative models like CLIP, generative\nmodels are better at capturing image details because they are trained to learn\nthe data distribution of images. Additionally, the conditional input space of\nunCLIP aligns with CLIP's original image-text embedding space. Therefore, we\npropose to invert unCLIP (dubbed un$^2$CLIP) to improve the CLIP model. In this\nway, the improved image encoder can gain unCLIP's visual detail capturing\nability while preserving its alignment with the original text encoder\nsimultaneously.

This extension enables the network to\ndifferentially weight neighbouring pixels based on their relative position to\nthe reference pixel, improving spatial characterisation and feature extraction.\nThe proposed operator maintains the same number of trainable parameters and is\nfully compatible with existing CNN architectures. Although developed for 2D\nimage data, the framework is generalisable to signals on regular grids of\narbitrary dimensions, such as 3D volumetric data or 1D time series. We propose\nan efficient implementation of the weighted convolution by pre-computing the\ndensity function and achieving execution times comparable to standard\nconvolution layers. We evaluate our method on two deep learning tasks: image\nclassification using the CIFAR-100 dataset [KH+09] and image denoising using\nthe DIV2K dataset [AT17]. Experimental results with state-of-the-art\nclassification (e.g., VGG [SZ15], ResNet [HZRS16]) and denoising (e.g., DnCNN\n[ZZC+17], NAFNet [CCZS22]) methods show that the weighted convolution improves\nperformance with respect to standard convolution across different quantitative\nmetrics.

Traditional semi-supervised segmentation and unsupervised\ndomain adaptation methods address one of these issues separately.

To tackle this issue, we propose the UST-RUN framework, which fully\nleverages intermediate domain information to facilitate knowledge transfer. We\nemploy Unified Copy-paste (UCP) to construct intermediate domains, and propose\na Symmetric GuiDance training strategy (SymGD) to supervise unlabeled data by\nmerging pseudo-labels from intermediate samples.

To generate\nmore diverse intermediate samples, we further select reliable samples with\nhigh-quality pseudo-labels, which are then mixed with other unlabeled data.\nAdditionally, we generate sophisticated intermediate samples with high-quality\npseudo-labels for unreliable samples, ensuring effective knowledge transfer for\nthem.

The laborious\nand costly process of FACS coding has motivated the development of machine\nlearning frameworks for Action Unit (AU) detection. Despite intense efforts\nspanning three decades, the detection accuracy for many AUs is considered to be\nbelow the threshold needed for behavioral research. Also, many AUs are excluded\naltogether, making it impossible to fulfill the ultimate goal of FACS-the\nrepresentation of any facial expression in its entirety. This paper considers\nan alternative approach. Instead of creating automated tools that mimic FACS\nexperts, we propose to use a new coding system that mimics the key properties\nof FACS. Specifically, we construct a data-driven coding system called the\nFacial Basis, which contains units that correspond to localized and\ninterpretable 3D facial movements, and overcomes three structural limitations\nof automated FACS coding. First, the proposed method is completely\nunsupervised, bypassing costly, laborious and variable manual annotation.\nSecond, Facial Basis reconstructs all observable movement, rather than relying\non a limited repertoire of recognizable movements (as in automated FACS).\nFinally, the Facial Basis units are additive, whereas AUs may fail detection\nwhen they appear in a non-additive combination.

Detection of\nCRC at early stages is crucial for increasing patient survival rates. However,\ncolonoscopy is dependent on obtaining adequate and high-quality endoscopic\nimages.

These images,\ntypically derived from video frames, often exhibit similar patterns, posing\nchallenges in discrimination. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel\nDeep Learning network built on a Few-Shot Learning architecture, which includes\na tailored feature extractor, task interpolation, relational embedding, and a\nbi-level routing attention mechanism.

Deep learning methods have shown promising results in segmenting\nhistorical maps, but publicly available datasets typically focus on a single\nmap type or period, require extensive and costly annotations, and are not\nsuited for nationwide, long-term analyses. In this paper, we introduce a new\ndataset of historical maps tailored for analyzing large-scale, long-term land\nuse and land cover evolution with limited annotations. Spanning metropolitan\nFrance (548,305 km^2), our dataset contains three map collections from the\n18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. We provide both comprehensive modern labels and\n22,878 km^2 of manually annotated historical labels for the 18th and 19th\ncentury maps. Our dataset illustrates the complexity of the segmentation task,\nfeaturing stylistic inconsistencies, interpretive ambiguities, and significant\nlandscape changes (e.g., marshlands disappearing in favor of forests). We\nassess the difficulty of these challenges by benchmarking three approaches: a\nfully-supervised model trained with historical labels, and two\nweakly-supervised models that rely only on modern annotations.

In\nthis paper, we propose a Hierarchical Multi-Granularity Image-Text Aligning\n(Hi-GITA) framework based on a contrastive paradigm. To leverage the abundant\nfine-grained semantic information of Chinese characters, we propose\nmulti-granularity encoders on both image and text sides. Specifically, the\nImage Multi-Granularity Encoder extracts hierarchical image representations\nfrom character images, capturing semantic cues from localized strokes to\nholistic structures. The Text Multi-Granularity Encoder extracts stroke and\nradical sequence representations at different levels of granularity. To better\ncapture the relationships between strokes and radicals, we introduce\nMulti-Granularity Fusion Modules on the image and text sides, respectively.\nFurthermore, to effectively bridge the two modalities, we further introduce a\nFine-Grained Decoupled Image-Text Contrastive loss, which aligns image and text\nrepresentations across multiple granularities.

However, the reasoning capabilities of\nmultimodal LLMs (MLLMs) still significantly lag, especially for complex\nvideo-language tasks. To address this issue, we present SiLVR, a Simple\nLanguage-based Video Reasoning framework that decomposes complex video\nunderstanding into two stages. In the first stage, SiLVR transforms raw video\ninto language-based representations using multisensory inputs, such as short\nclip captions and audio/speech subtitles. In the second stage, language\ndescriptions are fed into a powerful reasoning LLM to solve complex\nvideo-language understanding tasks. To handle long-context multisensory inputs,\nwe use an adaptive token reduction scheme, which dynamically determines the\ntemporal granularity with which to sample the tokens. Our simple, modular, and\ntraining-free video reasoning framework achieves the best-reported results on\nVideo-MME (long), Video-MMMU (comprehension), Video-MMLU, CGBench, and EgoLife.\nFurthermore, our empirical study focused on video reasoning capabilities shows\nthat, despite not being explicitly trained on video, strong reasoning LLMs can\neffectively aggregate multisensory input information from video, speech, and\naudio for complex temporal, causal, long-context, and knowledge acquisition\nreasoning tasks in video.

However, video object removal, a critical subtask of video\nediting, remains challenging due to issues such as hallucinated objects and\nvisual artifacts. Furthermore, existing methods often rely on computationally\nexpensive sampling procedures and classifier-free guidance (CFG), resulting in\nslow inference. To address these limitations, we propose MiniMax-Remover, a\nnovel two-stage video object removal approach. Motivated by the observation\nthat text condition is not best suited for this task, we simplify the\npretrained video generation model by removing textual input and cross-attention\nlayers, resulting in a more lightweight and efficient model architecture in the\nfirst stage. In the second stage, we distilled our remover on successful videos\nproduced by the stage-1 model and curated by human annotators, using a minimax\noptimization strategy to further improve editing quality and inference speed.\nSpecifically, the inner maximization identifies adversarial input noise (\"bad\nnoise\") that makes failure removals, while the outer minimization step trains\nthe model to generate high-quality removal results even under such challenging\nconditions.

This fast\nweight, akin to recurrent states in RNNs, stores temporary memories of past\ntokens in the current sequence. Existing TTT methods struggled to show\neffectiveness in handling long-context data, due to their inefficiency on\nmodern GPUs. The TTT layers in many of these approaches operate with extremely\nlow FLOPs utilization (often <5%) because they deliberately apply small online\nminibatch sizes (e.g., updating fast weights every 16 or 64 tokens). Moreover,\na small minibatch implies fine-grained block-wise causal dependencies in the\ndata, unsuitable for data beyond 1D ordered sequences, like sets or\nN-dimensional grids such as images or videos. In contrast, we pursue the\nopposite direction by using an extremely large chunk update, ranging from 2K to\n1M tokens across tasks of varying modalities, which we refer to as Large Chunk\nTest-Time Training (LaCT). It improves hardware utilization by orders of\nmagnitude, and more importantly, facilitates scaling of nonlinear state size\n(up to 40% of model parameters), hence substantially improving state capacity,\nall without requiring cumbersome and error-prone kernel implementations. It\nalso allows easy integration of sophisticated optimizers, e.g. Muon for online\nupdates. We validate our approach across diverse modalities and tasks,\nincluding novel view synthesis with image set, language models, and\nauto-regressive video diffusion. Our approach can scale up to 14B-parameter AR\nvideo diffusion model on sequences up to 56K tokens. In our longest sequence\nexperiment, we perform novel view synthesis with 1 million context length. We\nhope this work will inspire and accelerate new research in the field of\nlong-context modeling and test-time training.

While\nseveral recent works have extended 3DGS to mitigate these approximation errors,\nnone have successfully achieved both exactness and high efficiency\nsimultaneously. In this work, we introduce 3DGEER, an Exact and Efficient\nVolumetric Gaussian Rendering method.

However, fine-tuning foundation models on one task often\nleads to the issue of concept forgetting on other tasks. Recent methods of\nrobust fine-tuning aim to mitigate forgetting of prior knowledge without\naffecting the fine-tuning performance. Knowledge is often preserved by matching\nthe original and fine-tuned model weights or feature pairs. However, such\npoint-wise matching can be too strong, without explicit awareness of the\nfeature neighborhood structures that encode rich knowledge as well. We propose\na novel regularization method Proxy-FDA that explicitly preserves the\nstructural knowledge in feature space.

The\nmethodology is typically framed as the identification of a set of encoders, one\nfor each modality, that align representations within a common latent space. In\nthis work, we focus on the bimodal setting and interpret contrastive learning\nas the optimization of (parameterized) encoders that define conditional\nprobability distributions, for each modality conditioned on the other,\nconsistent with the available data. This provides a framework for multimodal\nalgorithms such as crossmodal retrieval, which identifies the mode of one of\nthese conditional distributions, and crossmodal classification, which is\nsimilar to retrieval but includes a fine-tuning step to make it task specific.\n  The framework we adopt also gives rise to crossmodal generative models. This\nprobabilistic perspective suggests two natural generalizations of contrastive\nlearning: the introduction of novel probabilistic loss functions, and the use\nof alternative metrics for measuring alignment in the common latent space. We\nstudy these generalizations of the classical approach in the multivariate\nGaussian setting. In this context we view the latent space identification as a\nlow-rank matrix approximation problem. This allows us to characterize the\ncapabilities of loss functions and alignment metrics to approximate natural\nstatistics, such as conditional means and covariances; doing so yields novel\nvariants on contrastive learning algorithms for specific mode-seeking and for\ngenerative tasks.

While deep learning has\ntransformed image analysis, 3D medical imaging still suffers from data scarcity\nand inconsistencies due to acquisition protocols, scanner differences, and\npatient motion. Traditional augmentation uses a single pipeline for all\ntransformations, disregarding the unique traits of each augmentation and\nstruggling with large data volumes.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-encoder Augmentation-Aware\nLearning (MEAL) framework that leverages four distinct augmentation variants\nprocessed through dedicated encoders.

For image\nfusion, we integrate low-frequency estimation and high-frequency injection\nmodules to combine the spatial and spectral information from spatial\nsuper-resolution and spectral super-resolution outputs. Additionally, we\nintroduce an efficient nonlocal post-processing step that leverages image\nself-similarity by combining a multi-head attention mechanism with residual\nconnections. Extensive evaluations on several datasets and sampling factors\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Unlike optimization-based approaches that require costly bi-level\noptimization, distribution matching (DM) methods improve efficiency by aligning\nthe distributions of synthetic and original data, thereby eliminating nested\noptimization. DM achieves high computational efficiency and has emerged as a\npromising solution. However, existing DM methods, constrained to Euclidean\nspace, treat data as independent and identically distributed points,\noverlooking complex geometric and hierarchical relationships. To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose a novel hyperbolic dataset distillation method, termed\nHDD. Hyperbolic space, characterized by negative curvature and exponential\nvolume growth with distance, naturally models hierarchical and tree-like\nstructures. HDD embeds features extracted by a shallow network into the Lorentz\nhyperbolic space, where the discrepancy between synthetic and original data is\nmeasured by the hyperbolic (geodesic) distance between their centroids. By\noptimizing this distance, the hierarchical structure is explicitly integrated\ninto the distillation process, guiding synthetic samples to gravitate towards\nthe root-centric regions of the original data distribution while preserving\ntheir underlying geometric characteristics. Furthermore, we find that pruning\nin hyperbolic space requires only 20% of the distilled core set to retain model\nperformance, while significantly improving training stability.

By leveraging 3D foundation models for dense,\nmarker-free multi-view correspondence, Bi-JCR jointly estimates: (i) the\nextrinsic transformation from each camera to its end-effector, (ii) the\ninter-arm relative poses between manipulators, and (iii) a unified,\nscale-consistent 3D representation of the shared workspace, all from the same\ncaptured RGB image sets. The representation, jointly constructed from images\ncaptured by cameras on both manipulators, lives in a common coordinate frame\nand supports collision checking and semantic segmentation to facilitate\ndownstream bimanual coordination tasks.
