However, this reasoning\nprocess has been confined exclusively to textual space, limiting its\neffectiveness in visually intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce the concept of reasoning in the pixel-space. Within this novel\nframework, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are equipped with a suite of visual\nreasoning operations, such as zoom-in and select-frame. These operations enable\nVLMs to directly inspect, interrogate, and infer from visual evidences, thereby\nenhancing reasoning fidelity for visual tasks. Cultivating such pixel-space\nreasoning capabilities in VLMs presents notable challenges, including the\nmodel's initially imbalanced competence and its reluctance to adopt the newly\nintroduced pixel-space operations. We address these challenges through a\ntwo-phase training approach. The first phase employs instruction tuning on\nsynthesized reasoning traces to familiarize the model with the novel visual\noperations. Following this, a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leverages a\ncuriosity-driven reward scheme to balance exploration between pixel-space\nreasoning and textual reasoning. With these visual operations, VLMs can\ninteract with complex visual inputs, such as information-rich images or videos\nto proactively gather necessary information.

Our results show that\nSAEs uncover hierarchical relationships in model activations, revealing an\nimplicit encoding of taxonomic structure. We analyze the consistency of these\nrepresentations across different layers of the popular vision foundation model\nDINOv2 and provide insights into how deep vision models internalize\nhierarchical category information by increasing information in the class token\nthrough each layer. Our study establishes a framework for systematic\nhierarchical analysis of vision model representations and highlights the\npotential of SAEs as a tool for probing semantic structure in deep networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAEs\uff09\u5206\u6790\u6df1\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u7f16\u7801ImageNet\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u542b\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u7f16\u7801ImageNet\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAEs\uff09\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982DINOv2\uff09\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e2d\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "SAEs\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e2d\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u542b\u5730\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "SAEs\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u63a2\u6d4b\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Our\nanalysis demonstrates that interventions along the faithful direction we\nidentified can mitigate hallucinations, while those along the hallucinatory\ndirection can exacerbate them. Building on these insights, we propose Steering\nLVLMs via SAE Latent Directions (SSL), a training-free method based on\nSAE-derived latent directions to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that SSL significantly outperforms existing decoding\napproaches in mitigating hallucinations, while maintaining transferability\nacross different model architectures with negligible additional time overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAE\uff09\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5SSL\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLM\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6587\u672c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u5e7b\u89c9\u6216\u5b9e\u9645\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSSL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e72\u9884\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u5411\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSSL\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u65f6\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "SSL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11LVLM\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Linear attention, a variant of softmax attention,\ndemonstrates promise in global context modeling while maintaining linear\ncomplexity, offering a potential solution to the above challenge.

Rethinking Concept Erasure Through Reversibility", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "comment": "Dr. Chi Zhang is the corresponding author", "summary": "To what extent does concept erasure eliminate generative capacity in\ndiffusion models? While prior evaluations have primarily focused on measuring\nconcept suppression under specific textual prompts, we explore a complementary\nand fundamental question: do current concept erasure techniques genuinely\nremove the ability to generate targeted concepts, or do they merely achieve\nsuperficial, prompt-specific suppression? We systematically evaluate the\nrobustness and reversibility of two representative concept erasure methods,\nUnified Concept Editing and Erased Stable Diffusion, by probing their ability\nto eliminate targeted generative behaviors in text-to-image models. These\nmethods attempt to suppress undesired semantic concepts by modifying internal\nmodel parameters, either through targeted attention edits or model-level\nfine-tuning strategies. To rigorously assess whether these techniques truly\nerase generative capacity, we propose an instance-level evaluation strategy\nthat employs lightweight fine-tuning to explicitly test the reactivation\npotential of erased concepts. Through quantitative metrics and qualitative\nanalyses, we show that erased concepts often reemerge with substantial visual\nfidelity after minimal adaptation, indicating that current methods suppress\nlatent generative representations without fully eliminating them.

To address this\nissue, we reconstructed new datasets by leveraging existing MedVQA datasets and\nChanged their P3rior dependencies (CP) between questions and their answers in\nthe training and test set.

This allows for optimizing the\nfocused coverage over the complex 3D geometry of the human body given the\ncalibrated camera poses.

The concatenation of original and augmented labeled\ndata is fed into student network to generate expressive prototypes. Then, a\njoint uncertainty quantification method is devised to optimize pseudo-labels\nand generate reliable prototypes for original and augmented unlabeled data\nseparately. High-quality global prototypes for each class are formed by fusing\nlabeled and unlabeled prototypes, which are utilized to generate\nprototype-to-features to conduct consistency learning. Notably, a prototype\nnetwork is proposed to reduce high memory requirements brought by the\nintroduction of augmented data. Extensive experiments on Left Atrium,\nPancreas-NIH, Type B Aortic Dissection datasets demonstrate EPCL-JUDA's\nsuperiority over previous state-of-the-art approaches, confirming the\neffectiveness of our framework.

While state-of-the-art defenses can achieve\ncertified robustness with minimal impact on utility against highly-concentrated\nlocalized patch attacks, they fall short in two important areas: (i)\nState-of-the-art methods are vulnerable to low-noise distributed patches where\nperturbations are subtly dispersed to evade detection or masking, as shown\nrecently by the DorPatch attack; (ii) Achieving high robustness with\nstate-of-the-art methods is extremely time and resource-consuming, rendering\nthem impractical for latency-sensitive applications in many cyber-physical\nsystems.\n  To address both robustness and latency issues, this paper proposes a new\ndefense strategy for adversarial patch attacks called SuperPure.

The masking involves leveraging a GAN-based\nsuper-resolution scheme to gradually purify the image from adversarial patches.\nOur extensive evaluations using ImageNet and two standard classifiers, ResNet\nand EfficientNet, show that SuperPure advances the state-of-the-art in three\nmajor directions: (i) it improves the robustness against conventional localized\npatches by more than 20%, on average, while also improving top-1 clean accuracy\nby almost 10%; (ii) It achieves 58% robustness against distributed patch\nattacks (as opposed to 0% in state-of-the-art method, PatchCleanser); (iii) It\ndecreases the defense end-to-end latency by over 98% compared to PatchCleanser.\nOur further analysis shows that SuperPure is robust against white-box attacks\nand different patch sizes.

We take the first step towards panoptic\ncaptioning by formulating it as a task of generating a comprehensive textual\ndescription for an image, which encapsulates all entities, their respective\nlocations and attributes, relationships among entities, as well as global image\nstate.Through an extensive evaluation, our work reveals that state-of-the-art\nMulti-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have limited performance in solving\npanoptic captioning.

Specifically, our PancapEngine first detects\ndiverse categories of entities in images by an elaborate detection suite, and\nthen generates required panoptic captions using entity-aware prompts.\nAdditionally, our PancapChain explicitly decouples the challenging panoptic\ncaptioning task into multiple stages and generates panoptic captions step by\nstep.

We introduce two novel techniques for semantically consistent\nstyle transfer using diffusion models: Class-wise Adaptive Instance\nNormalization and Cross-Attention (CACTI) and its extension with selective\nattention Filtering (CACTIF). CACTI applies statistical normalization\nselectively based on semantic classes, while CACTIF further filters\ncross-attention maps based on feature similarity, preventing artifacts in\nregions with weak cross-attention correspondences. Our methods transfer style\ncharacteristics while preserving semantic boundaries and structural coherence,\nunlike approaches that apply global transformations or generate content without\nconstraints.

We compare with 5\nadvanced adversarial patches and evaluate their attack performance on 8 object\ndetecotrs, including single-stage, two-stage, and transformer-based models.\nExtensive experiment results in digital and physical environments demonstrate\nthat the adversarial textures generated by our method can effectively mislead\nthe target detection model. Moreover, proposed method demonstrates excellent\nrobustness and transferability under multi-angle attacks, varying lighting\nconditions, and different distance in the physical world.

However, when\nextended to large vision-language models (LVLMs), its variants introduce\nunintended cross-modal positional biases. Specifically, they enforce relative\npositional dependencies between text token indices and image tokens, causing\nspurious alignments. This issue arises because image tokens representing the\nsame content but located at different spatial positions are assigned distinct\npositional biases, leading to inconsistent cross-modal associations. To address\nthis, we propose Per-Token Distance (PTD) - a simple yet effective metric for\nquantifying the independence of positional encodings across modalities.\nInformed by this analysis, we introduce Circle-RoPE, a novel encoding scheme\nthat maps image token indices onto a circular trajectory orthogonal to the\nlinear path of text token indices, forming a cone-like structure.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as a\nuseful tool for investigating this question, as they have internal\nrepresentations similar to those of humans as a byproduct of optimizing their\nobjective functions. While previous studies have shown that models trained with\nvarious learning paradigms - such as supervised, self-supervised, and CLIP -\nacquire human-like representations, it remains unclear whether their similarity\nto human representations is primarily at a coarse category level or extends to\nfiner details. Here, we employ an unsupervised alignment method based on\nGromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport to compare human and model object\nrepresentations at both fine-grained and coarse-grained levels. The unique\nfeature of this method compared to conventional representational similarity\nanalysis is that it estimates optimal fine-grained mappings between the\nrepresentation of each object in human and model representations. We used this\nunsupervised alignment method to assess the extent to which the representation\nof each object in humans is correctly mapped to the corresponding\nrepresentation of the same object in models.

One of the most\ncommonly used metrics for evaluating cardiac pumping performance is left\nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). However, LVEF can be affected by factors\nsuch as inter-observer variability and varying pre-load and after-load\nconditions, which can reduce its reproducibility. Additionally, cardiac\ndysfunction may not always manifest as alterations in LVEF, such as in heart\nfailure and cardiotoxicity diseases. An alternative measure that can provide a\nrelatively load-independent quantitative assessment of myocardial contractility\nis myocardial strain and strain rate. By using LVEF in combination with\nmyocardial strain, it is possible to obtain a thorough description of cardiac\nfunction. Automated estimation of LVEF and other volumetric measures from\ncine-MRI sequences can be achieved through segmentation models, while strain\ncalculation requires the estimation of tissue displacement between sequential\nframes, which can be accomplished using registration models. These tasks are\noften performed separately, potentially limiting the assessment of cardiac\nfunction. To address this issue, in this study we propose an end-to-end deep\nlearning (DL) model that jointly estimates groupwise (GW) registration and\nsegmentation for cardiac cine-MRI images.

While such methods excel under ideal\nconditions with a large volume of labeled training data, challenges arise in\nrealistic scenarios, emphasizing the need to further examine the efficacy of\noptic detection for automated sorting.\n  In this study, we compiled novel datasets totaling 20,000+ images from varied\nsources.

Extensive experiments across five in-domain and\ntwo cross-domain datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MEgoHand, achieving\nsubstantial reductions in wrist translation error (86.9%) and joint rotation\nerror (34.1%), highlighting its capacity to accurately model fine-grained hand\njoint structures and generalize robustly across diverse scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "MEgoHand\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u624b-\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u624b\u8155\u5e73\u79fb\u548c\u5173\u8282\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65b0\u578b\u7269\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u9ad8\u5c42\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u4f4e\u5c42\u57fa\u4e8eDiT\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u624b\u8155\u5e73\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e86.9%\uff0c\u5173\u8282\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e34.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "MEgoHand\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u624b\u90e8\u5173\u8282\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u6837\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Single-image\nquestions focus on abnormalities within a specific CXR (\"What abnormalities are\nseen in image X?\"), while image-difference questions compare two longitudinal\nCXRs acquired at different time points (\"What are the differences between image\nX and Y?\"). We further explore how the integration of radiology reports can\nenhance the performance of VQA models.

First, we\npropose a unified method that handles both types of questions and\nauto-regressively generates the answers. For single-image questions, the model\nis provided with a single CXR. For image-difference questions, the model is\nprovided with two CXRs from the same patient, captured at different time\npoints, enabling the model to detect and describe temporal changes. Taking\ninspiration from 'Chain-of-Thought reasoning', we demonstrate that performance\non the CXR VQA task can be improved by grounding the answer generator module\nwith a radiology report predicted for the same CXR. In our approach, the VQA\nmodel is divided into two steps: i) Report Generation (RG) and ii) Answer\nGeneration (AG).

We design an attention register structure within the upper\ntriangular matrix of the causal mask, dynamically allocating attention to\ncapture attention diverted to outlier tokens.

The most popular methods are still borrowed from the more mature\nfield of multispectral pansharpening and often overlook the unique challenges\nposed by hyperspectral data fusion, such as i) the very large number of bands,\nii) the overwhelming noise in selected spectral ranges, iii) the significant\nspectral mismatch between panchromatic and hyperspectral components, iv) a\ntypically high resolution ratio. Imprecise data modeling especially affects\nspectral fidelity. Even state-of-the-art methods perform well in certain\nspectral ranges and much worse in others, failing to ensure consistent quality\nacross all bands, with the risk of generating unreliable results. Here, we\npropose a hyperspectral pansharpening method that explicitly addresses this\nproblem and ensures uniform spectral quality. To this end, a single lightweight\nneural network is used, with weights that adapt on the fly to each band. During\nfine-tuning, the spatial loss is turned on and off to ensure a fast convergence\nof the spectral loss to the desired level, according to a hysteresis-like\ndynamic. Furthermore, the spatial loss itself is appropriately redefined to\naccount for nonlinear dependencies between panchromatic and spectral bands.\nOverall, the proposed method is fully unsupervised, with no prior training on\nexternal data, flexible, and low-complexity.

While image-text models excel at interpreting pixel-level\ncolor and lighting cues, 3D-text models capture volumetric structure and\nspatial relationships. However, unified fusion approaches that jointly fuse 2D\nimages, 3D point clouds, and textual instructions face challenges in limited\navailability of triple-modality data and difficulty resolving conflicting\nbeliefs among modalities. In this work, we introduce CoNav, a collaborative\ncross-modal reasoning framework where a pretrained 3D-text model explicitly\nguides an image-text navigation agent by providing structured spatial-semantic\nknowledge to resolve ambiguities during navigation. Specifically, we introduce\nCross-Modal Belief Alignment, which operationalizes this cross-modal guidance\nby simply sharing textual hypotheses from the 3D-text model to the navigation\nagent. Through lightweight fine-tuning on a small 2D-3D-text corpus, the\nnavigation agent learns to integrate visual cues with spatial-semantic\nknowledge derived from the 3D-text model, enabling effective reasoning in\nembodied navigation. CoNav achieves significant improvements on four standard\nembodied navigation benchmarks (R2R, CVDN, REVERIE, SOON) and two spatial\nreasoning benchmarks (ScanQA, SQA3D). Moreover, under close navigation Success\nRate, CoNav often generates shorter paths compared to other methods (as\nmeasured by SPL), showcasing the potential and challenges of fusing data from\ndifferent modalities in embodied navigation.

A recent remedy -- representation\nalignment (REPA) that matches DiT hidden features to those of a non-generative\nteacher (e.g. DINO) -- dramatically accelerates the early epochs but plateaus\nor even degrades performance later. We trace this failure to a capacity\nmismatch: once the generative student begins modelling the joint data\ndistribution, the teacher's lower-dimensional embeddings and attention patterns\nbecome a straitjacket rather than a guide. We then introduce HASTE (Holistic\nAlignment with Stage-wise Termination for Efficient training), a two-phase\nschedule that keeps the help and drops the hindrance. Phase I applies a\nholistic alignment loss that simultaneously distills attention maps (relational\npriors) and feature projections (semantic anchors) from the teacher into\nmid-level layers of the DiT, yielding rapid convergence. Phase II then performs\none-shot termination that deactivates the alignment loss, once a simple trigger\nsuch as a fixed iteration is hit, freeing the DiT to focus on denoising and\nexploit its generative capacity. HASTE speeds up training of diverse DiTs\nwithout architecture changes. On ImageNet 256X256, it reaches the vanilla\nSiT-XL/2 baseline FID in 50 epochs and matches REPA's best FID in 500 epochs,\namounting to a 28X reduction in optimization steps.

In this paper, we present a modular pipeline that\ntransforms action-level prompts into visually and auditorily grounded narrative\ndialogue, enriching visual storytelling with natural voice and character\nexpression. Our method takes as input a pair of prompts per scene, where the\nfirst defines the setting and the second specifies a character's behavior.\nWhile a story generation model such as Text2Story generates the corresponding\nvisual scene, we focus on generating expressive character utterances from these\nprompts and the scene image. We apply a pretrained vision-language encoder to\nextract a high-level semantic feature from the representative frame, capturing\nsalient visual context. This feature is then combined with the structured\nprompts and used to guide a large language model in synthesizing natural,\ncharacter-consistent dialogue. To ensure contextual consistency across scenes,\nwe introduce a Recursive Narrative Bank that conditions each dialogue\ngeneration on the accumulated dialogue history from prior scenes. This approach\nenables characters to speak in ways that reflect their evolving goals and\ninteractions throughout a story.

To better approximate this workflow, we introduce MedFrameQA -- the\nfirst benchmark that explicitly evaluates multi-image reasoning in medical VQA.\nTo build MedFrameQA both at scale and in high-quality, we develop 1) an\nautomated pipeline that extracts temporally coherent frames from medical videos\nand constructs VQA items whose content evolves logically across images, and 2)\na multiple-stage filtering strategy, including model-based and manual review,\nto preserve data clarity, difficulty, and medical relevance. The resulting\ndataset comprises 2,851 VQA pairs (gathered from 9,237 high-quality frames in\n3,420 videos), covering nine human body systems and 43 organs; every question\nis accompanied by two to five images. We comprehensively benchmark ten advanced\nMultimodal LLMs -- both proprietary and open source, with and without explicit\nreasoning modules -- on MedFrameQA.

The primary challenge involves preserving the visual\nauthenticity of the garment while dynamically adapting to the pose and physique\nof the subject. While existing methods have predominantly focused on\nimage-based virtual try-on, extending these techniques directly to videos often\nresults in temporal inconsistencies. Most current video virtual try-on\napproaches alleviate this challenge by incorporating temporal modules, yet\nstill overlook the critical spatiotemporal pose interactions between human and\ngarment. Effective pose interactions in videos should not only consider spatial\nalignment between human and garment poses in each frame but also account for\nthe temporal dynamics of human poses throughout the entire video. With such\nmotivation, we propose a new framework, namely Dynamic Pose Interaction\nDiffusion Models (DPIDM), to leverage diffusion models to delve into dynamic\npose interactions for video virtual try-on. Technically, DPIDM introduces a\nskeleton-based pose adapter to integrate synchronized human and garment poses\ninto the denoising network. A hierarchical attention module is then exquisitely\ndesigned to model intra-frame human-garment pose interactions and long-term\nhuman pose dynamics across frames through pose-aware spatial and temporal\nattention mechanisms. Moreover, DPIDM capitalizes on a temporal regularized\nattention loss between consecutive frames to enhance temporal consistency.\nExtensive experiments conducted on VITON-HD, VVT and ViViD datasets demonstrate\nthe superiority of our DPIDM against the baseline methods.

We observe that training with a purely discrete\ndiffusion approach leads to significant training instability, suboptimal\nperformance, and severe length bias issues. To address these challenges, we\ndesign a novel training paradigm that combines an initial autoregressive phase\nwith a subsequent diffusion phase.

To improve inference efficiency, we propose a decoding\nstrategy termed confident decoding, which dynamically adjusts the number of\ntokens generated at each step, significantly reducing the number of generation\niterations. In autoregressive models, the number of forward iterations during\ngeneration equals the response length.

This sets the foundation for a new paradigm of\nnative, backbone-level segmentation, which enables strong zero-shot results\nwithout mask supervision, as well as a minimal and efficient standalone model\ndesign for downstream segmentation tasks.

Two prominent RL algorithms, Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are central\nto these developments, showcasing different pros and cons. Autoregressive image\ngeneration, also interpretable as a sequential CoT reasoning process, presents\nunique challenges distinct from LLM-based CoT reasoning. These encompass\nensuring text-image consistency, improving image aesthetic quality, and\ndesigning sophisticated reward models, rather than relying on simpler\nrule-based rewards. While recent efforts have extended RL to this domain, these\nexplorations typically lack an in-depth analysis of the domain-specific\nchallenges and the characteristics of different RL strategies. To bridge this\ngap, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the GRPO and DPO\nalgorithms in autoregressive image generation, evaluating their in-domain\nperformance and out-of-domain generalization, while scrutinizing the impact of\ndifferent reward models on their respective capabilities. Our findings reveal\nthat GRPO and DPO exhibit distinct advantages, and crucially, that reward\nmodels possessing stronger intrinsic generalization capabilities potentially\nenhance the generalization potential of the applied RL algorithms. Furthermore,\nwe systematically explore three prevalent scaling strategies to enhance both\ntheir in-domain and out-of-domain proficiency, deriving unique insights into\nefficiently scaling performance for each paradigm.

However, this paradigm typically lacks\nsupervision over the thinking process leading to the final outcome.As a result,\nthe model may learn sub-optimal reasoning strategies, which can hinder its\ngeneralization ability. In light of this, we propose SophiaVL-R1, as an attempt\nto add reward signals for the thinking process in this paradigm. To achieve\nthis, we first train a thinking reward model that evaluates the quality of the\nentire thinking process. Given that the thinking reward may be unreliable for\ncertain samples due to reward hacking, we propose the Trust-GRPO method, which\nassigns a trustworthiness weight to the thinking reward during training. This\nweight is computed based on the thinking reward comparison of responses leading\nto correct answers versus incorrect answers, helping to mitigate the impact of\npotentially unreliable thinking rewards. Moreover, we design an annealing\ntraining strategy that gradually reduces the thinking reward over time,\nallowing the model to rely more on the accurate rule-based outcome reward in\nlater training stages. Experiments show that our SophiaVL-R1 surpasses a series\nof reasoning MLLMs on various benchmarks (e.g., MathVisita, MMMU),\ndemonstrating strong reasoning and generalization capabilities.

While multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs) excel in basic Visual Question Answer (VQA) tasks, they\nstruggle with a fundamental limitation on image implication tasks: contextual\ngaps that obscure the relationships between different visual elements and their\nabstract meanings. Inspired by the human cognitive process, we propose Let\nAndroids Dream (LAD), a novel framework for image implication understanding and\nreasoning. LAD addresses contextual missing through the three-stage framework:\n(1) Perception: converting visual information into rich and multi-level textual\nrepresentations, (2) Search: iteratively searching and integrating cross-domain\nknowledge to resolve ambiguity, and (3) Reasoning: generating context-alignment\nimage implication via explicit reasoning. Our framework with the lightweight\nGPT-4o-mini model achieves SOTA performance compared to 15+ MLLMs on English\nimage implication benchmark and a huge improvement on Chinese benchmark,\nperforming comparable with the GPT-4o model on Multiple-Choice Question (MCQ)\nand outperforms 36.7% on Open-Style Question (OSQ).

However,\ncurrent progress often prioritizes maximizing reconstruction fidelity while\noverlooking interpretability, an essential aspect for deriving neuroscientific\ninsight. To address this gap, we propose MoRE-Brain, a neuro-inspired framework\ndesigned for high-fidelity, adaptable, and interpretable visual reconstruction.\nMoRE-Brain uniquely employs a hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts architecture\nwhere distinct experts process fMRI signals from functionally related voxel\ngroups, mimicking specialized brain networks.

In this paper, we propose a Physics-Informed\nCross-Modal State Space Model Network (PCMamba) for DCCHI, which incorporates\nthe forward physical imaging process of HSI into the linear complexity of Mamba\nto facilitate lightweight and high-quality HSI reconstruction. Specifically, we\nanalyze the imaging process of hyperspectral thermal signals to enable the\nnetwork to disentangle the three key physical properties-temperature,\nemissivity, and texture. By fully exploiting the potential information embedded\nin 2D measurements and PAN images, the HSIs are reconstructed through a\nphysics-driven synthesis process. Furthermore, we design a Cross-Modal Scanning\nMamba Block (CSMB) that introduces inter-modal pixel-wise interaction with\npositional inductive bias by cross-scanning the backbone features and PAN\nfeatures. Extensive experiments conducted on both real and simulated datasets\ndemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms SOTA methods in both\nquantitative and qualitative metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PCMamba\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53cc\u76f8\u673a\u538b\u7f29\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u6210\u50cf\uff08DCCHI\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u6210\u50cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548cMamba\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u4ece2D\u538b\u7f29\u6d4b\u91cf\u548cPAN\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u663e\u5f0f\u63d0\u53d6\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u91cd\u5efa\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u7269\u7406\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u53d1\u5c04\u7387\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u95f4\u591a\u6b21\u53cd\u5c04\uff09\u5728\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u70ed\u4fe1\u53f7\u83b7\u53d6\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6df1\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPCMamba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u70ed\u4fe1\u53f7\u6210\u50cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u53d1\u5c04\u7387\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u5408\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u626b\u63cfMamba\u5757\uff08CSMB\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u626b\u63cf\u4e3b\u5e72\u7279\u5f81\u548cPAN\u7279\u5f81\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PCMamba\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u6210\u50cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548cMamba\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4e3aDCCHI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Selective Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Language Models", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CV"], "comment": null, "summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven to be an effective post-training\nstrategy for enhancing reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs). Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a recent prominent method that\nencourages models to generate complete reasoning traces before answering,\nleading to increased token usage and computational cost. Inspired by the\nhuman-like thinking process-where people skip reasoning for easy questions but\nthink carefully when needed-we explore how to enable VLMs to first decide when\nreasoning is necessary. To realize this, we propose TON, a two-stage training\nstrategy: (i) a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage with a simple yet effective\n'thought dropout' operation, where reasoning traces are randomly replaced with\nempty thoughts. This introduces a think-or-not format that serves as a cold\nstart for selective reasoning; (ii) a GRPO stage that enables the model to\nfreely explore when to think or not, while maximizing task-aware outcome\nrewards. Experimental results show that TON can reduce the completion length by\nup to 90% compared to vanilla GRPO, without sacrificing performance or even\nimproving it.

When trained on the same\ninstruction data, LLaDA-V is highly competitive to LLaMA3-V across multimodal\ntasks with better data scalability.

These results highlight RIPT-VLA as a practical and\neffective paradigm for post-training VLA models through minimal supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "RIPT-VLA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u4e8c\u5143\u6210\u529f\u5956\u52b1\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u79bb\u7ebf\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u636e\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u4eff\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u7684\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u3002RIPT-VLA\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u6eda\u52a8\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u7559\u4e00\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5982QueST\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u534721.2%\uff0cOpenVLA-OFT\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u523097.5%\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff08\u4ec5\u9700\u4e00\u6b21\u6f14\u793a\u5373\u53ef\u5c06\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ece4%\u63d0\u5347\u81f397%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "RIPT-VLA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}
