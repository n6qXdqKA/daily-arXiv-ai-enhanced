While recent efforts have explored adapting large language\nmodels (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture\none-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer\nspatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In\nthis paper, we present \\textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically\nreprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal\nforecasting.

To effectively\nprocess these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming\nstages.

To address this issue,\nthis paper proposes a prototypical augmentation and alignment method, termed\nProtoConNet, which incorporates background information from different samples\nto enhance the diversity of the feature space, breaking the spurious\nassociations between context and image subjects in few-shot scenarios.\nSpecifically, it consists of three main modules: the clustering-based data\nselection (CDS) module mines diverse data patterns while preserving core\nfeatures; the contextual-enhanced semantic refinement (CSR) module builds a\ncontext dictionary to integrate into image representations, which boosts the\nmodel's robustness in various scenarios; and the prototypical alignment (PA)\nmodule reduces the gap between image representations and class prototypes,\namplifying feature distances for known and unknown classes. Experimental\nresults from two datasets verified that ProtoConNet enhances the effectiveness\nof representation learning in few-shot scenarios and identifies open-set\nsamples, making it superior to existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "ProtoConNet\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u80cc\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6574\u5408\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faProtoConNet\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u805a\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\uff08CDS\uff09\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u7ec6\u5316\uff08CSR\uff09\u548c\u539f\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08PA\uff09\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cProtoConNet\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u6837\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ProtoConNet\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u6574\u5408\u548c\u539f\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However,\naccording to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components\nare vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling\nlayers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency\nModulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency\nbefore downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling.\nSpecifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and\ndesign a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to\nscale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the\nFrequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling\n(MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency\ninformation through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves\nsegmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely\nand sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly\nintegrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural\nnetworks to transformers.

However, naively using an event-assisted 3D GS approach still faced\nchallenges because, in low light, events are noisy, frames lack quality, and\nthe color tone may be inconsistent. To address these issues, we propose\nDark-EvGS, the first event-assisted 3D GS framework that enables the\nreconstruction of bright frames from arbitrary viewpoints along the camera\ntrajectory. Triplet-level supervision is proposed to gain holistic knowledge,\ngranular details, and sharp scene rendering. The color tone matching block is\nproposed to guarantee the color consistency of the rendered frames.\nFurthermore, we introduce the first real-captured dataset for the event-guided\nbright frame synthesis task via 3D GS-based radiance field reconstruction.\nExperiments demonstrate that our method achieves better results than existing\nmethods, conquering radiance field reconstruction under challenging low-light\nconditions.

However, the attention\nmechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the\nstacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency\nvanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose\na novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention\nModulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly\nmodulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two\ntechniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling\n(FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental\nelements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass\nfiltering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and\ndynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different\nfrequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response\nfunction. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we\ndemonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to\nconsistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer,\nDeiT, and MaskDINO.

A novel filter\nbank-based spectral processing paradigm and a self-distillation-driven\ndecoupling loss are proposed to improve the spectral domain decoupling.

First, they primarily focus on\nsingle-view data (e.g., images), overlooking the increasingly common multi-view\ndata, such as multi-omics datasets used in disease diagnosis. Second, their\nreliance on pseudo-labels to supervise novel class clustering often results in\nunstable performance, as pseudo-label quality is highly sensitive to factors\nsuch as data noise and feature dimensionality. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel framework named Intra-view and Inter-view Correlation Guided\nMulti-view Novel Class Discovery (IICMVNCD), which is the first attempt to\nexplore NCD in multi-view setting so far. Specifically, at the intra-view\nlevel, leveraging the distributional similarity between known and novel\nclasses, we employ matrix factorization to decompose features into\nview-specific shared base matrices and factor matrices. The base matrices\ncapture distributional consistency among the two datasets, while the factor\nmatrices model pairwise relationships between samples. At the inter-view level,\nwe utilize view relationships among known classes to guide the clustering of\nnovel classes.

While recent efforts have concentrated mainly on cross-domain\ngeneralization, two significant challenges persist: limited semantic\nunderstanding of attack types and training redundancy across domains.

For the second challenge, we employ a meta-domain\nstrategy to learn a unified model that generalizes well across multiple\ndomains.

While\nDETR-based joint frameworks have made significant strides, there remains\nuntapped potential in harnessing the intricate relationships between temporal\nmotion and spatial semantics within video content. In this paper, we propose\nthe Motion-Semantics DETR (MS-DETR), a framework that captures rich\nmotion-semantics features through unified learning for MR/HD tasks.

This\nleads to highly entangled features and strong black-box characteristics, making\nthe model prone to shortcut learning. To mitigate the above issues, this paper\nproposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature\nspace decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet\ntransform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and\nhigh-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by\nadjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through\nmulti-level wavelet decomposition. Thus, by using wavelet transform the feature\nspace is decomposed into a low-frequency branch for illumination adjustment and\nmultiple high-frequency branches for texture enhancement. Additionally, stereo\nlow-light image enhancement can extract useful cues from another view to\nimprove enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel high-frequency guided\ncross-view interaction module (HF-CIM) that operates within high-frequency\nbranches rather than across the entire feature space, effectively extracting\nvaluable image details from the other view. Furthermore, to enhance the\nhigh-frequency information, a detail and texture enhancement module (DTEM) is\nproposed based on cross-attention mechanism.

To appear in Proc.

While current state-of-the-art methods rely\non discriminative, self-supervised contrastive models, we demonstrate that\ngenerative text-to-image diffusion models, leveraging cross-attention maps, can\nachieve superior zero-shot phrase grounding performance. Contrary to prior\nassumptions, we show that fine-tuning diffusion models with a frozen,\ndomain-specific language model, such as CXR-BERT, substantially outperforms\ndomain-agnostic counterparts. This setup achieves remarkable improvements, with\nmIoU scores doubling those of current discriminative methods. These findings\nhighlight the underexplored potential of generative models for phrase grounding\ntasks. To further enhance performance, we introduce Bimodal Bias Merging (BBM),\na novel post-processing technique that aligns text and image biases to identify\nregions of high certainty.

By using interpolated boxes to\nbridge the gap between predictions and ground truth, InterpIoU provides\nmeaningful gradients in non-overlapping cases and inherently avoids the box\nenlargement issue caused by misaligned penalties. Simulation results further\nshow that IoU itself serves as an ideal regression target, while existing\ngeometric penalties are both unnecessary and suboptimal. Building on InterpIoU,\nwe introduce Dynamic InterpIoU, which dynamically adjusts interpolation\ncoefficients based on IoU values, enhancing adaptability to scenarios with\ndiverse object distributions.

General-purpose foundational segmentation models, such\nas SAM (Segment Anything Model), do not support landmark segmentation out of\nthe box and require prompts to function. However, in medical imaging, the\nprompts for landmarks are highly specific. Since SAM has not been trained to\nrecognize such landmarks, it cannot generate accurate landmark segmentations\nfor diagnostic purposes. Even MedSAM, a medically adapted variant of SAM, has\nbeen trained to identify larger anatomical structures, such as organs and their\nparts, and lacks the fine-grained precision required for orthopaedic pelvic\nlandmarks. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging another\ngeneral-purpose, non-foundational model: YOLO. YOLO excels in object detection\nand can provide bounding boxes that serve as input prompts for SAM. While YOLO\nis efficient at detection, it is significantly outperformed by SAM in\nsegmenting complex structures. In combination, these two models form a reliable\npipeline capable of segmenting not only a small pilot set of eight anatomical\nlandmarks but also an expanded set of 72 landmarks and 16 regions with complex\noutlines, such as the femoral cortical bone and the pelvic inlet. By using\nYOLO-generated bounding boxes to guide SAM, we trained the hybrid model to\naccurately segment orthopaedic pelvic radiographs.

However, their performance has mostly been tested\nin the context of rigid or less complex structures, such as the brain or\nabdominal organs, and it remains unclear whether these models can handle more\nchallenging, deformable anatomy. Breast MRI registration is particularly\ndifficult due to significant anatomical variation between patients, deformation\ncaused by patient positioning, and the presence of thin and complex internal\nstructure of fibroglandular tissue, where accurate alignment is crucial.\nWhether foundation model-based registration algorithms can address this level\nof complexity remains an open question. In this study, we provide a\ncomprehensive evaluation of foundation model-based registration algorithms for\nbreast MRI. We assess five pre-trained encoders, including DINO-v2, SAM,\nMedSAM, SSLSAM, and MedCLIP, across four key breast registration tasks that\ncapture variations in different years and dates, sequences, modalities, and\npatient disease status (lesion versus no lesion). Our results show that\nfoundation model-based algorithms such as SAM outperform traditional\nregistration baselines for overall breast alignment, especially under large\ndomain shifts, but struggle with capturing fine details of fibroglandular\ntissue.

However, non-destructive testing (NDT) of advanced\npackaging becomes increasingly challenging due to the depth and complexity of\nthe layers involved. In such a scenario, Magnetic field imaging (MFI) enables\nthe imaging of magnetic fields generated by currents. For MFI to be effective\nin NDT, the magnetic fields must be converted into current density. This\nconversion has typically relied solely on a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for\nmagnetic field inversion; however, the existing approach does not consider eddy\ncurrent effects or image misalignment in the test setup. In this paper, we\npresent a spatial-physics informed model (SPIM) designed for a 3D spiral sample\nscanned using Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) microscopy.\nThe SPIM encompasses three key components: i) magnetic image enhancement by\naligning all the \"sharp\" wire field signals to mitigate the eddy current effect\nusing both in-phase (I-channel) and quadrature-phase (Q-channel) images; (ii)\nmagnetic image alignment that addresses skew effects caused by any misalignment\nof the scanning SQUID microscope relative to the wire segments; and (iii) an\ninversion method for converting magnetic fields to magnetic currents by\nintegrating the Biot-Savart Law with FFT. The results show that the SPIM\nimproves I-channel sharpness by 0.3% and reduces Q-channel sharpness by 25%.\nAlso, we were able to remove rotational and skew misalignments of 0.30 in a\nreal image. Overall, SPIM highlights the potential of combining spatial\nanalysis with physics-driven models in practical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u6a21\u578b\uff08SPIM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5148\u8fdb\u5c01\u88c5\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7834\u574f\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08NDT\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u78c1\u6210\u50cf\uff08MFI\uff09\u548c\u7535\u6d41\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u6da1\u6d41\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u8fdb\u5c01\u88c5\u7684\u975e\u7834\u574f\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56e0\u5c42\u6df1\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u800c\u53d8\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5feb\u901f\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\uff08FFT\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u78c1\u573a\u53cd\u8f6c\uff0c\u672a\u8003\u8651\u6da1\u6d41\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u9519\u4f4d\u3002", "method": "SPIM\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u5206\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u201c\u9510\u5229\u201d\u5bfc\u7ebf\u4fe1\u53f7\u589e\u5f3a\u78c1\u56fe\u50cf\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u6da1\u6d41\u6548\u5e94\uff1b2\uff09\u7ea0\u6b63\u626b\u63cfSQUID\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u7684\u9519\u4f4d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u503e\u659c\u6548\u5e94\uff1b3\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u6bd5\u5965-\u8428\u4f10\u5c14\u5b9a\u5f8b\u548cFFT\u5c06\u78c1\u573a\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7535\u6d41\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "SPIM\u5c06I\u901a\u9053\u9510\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e860.3%\uff0cQ\u901a\u9053\u9510\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8625%\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d0.30\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u503e\u659c\u9519\u4f4d\u3002", "conclusion": "SPIM\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Recent advances in\nlarge-scale models have led to benchmark solutions such as GraspNet-1Billion.\nHowever, such learning-based approaches still face a critical limitation in\nperformance robustness for their sensitivity to sensing noise and environmental\nchanges. To address this bottleneck in achieving highly generalized grasping,\nwe abandon the traditional learning framework and introduce a new perspective:\nsimilarity matching, where similar known objects are utilized to guide the\ngrasping of unknown target objects. We newly propose a method that robustly\nachieves unknown-object grasping from a single viewpoint through three key\nsteps: 1) Leverage the visual features of the observed object to perform\nsimilarity matching with an existing database containing various object models,\nidentifying potential candidates with high similarity; 2) Use the candidate\nmodels with pre-existing grasping knowledge to plan imitative grasps for the\nunknown target object; 3) Optimize the grasp quality through a local\nfine-tuning process. To address the uncertainty caused by partial and noisy\nobservation, we propose a multi-level similarity matching framework that\nintegrates semantic, geometric, and dimensional features for comprehensive\nevaluation. Especially, we introduce a novel point cloud geometric descriptor,\nthe C-FPFH descriptor, which facilitates accurate similarity assessment between\npartial point clouds of observed objects and complete point clouds of database\nmodels. In addition, we incorporate the use of large language models, introduce\nthe semi-oriented bounding box, and develop a novel point cloud registration\napproach based on plane detection to enhance matching accuracy under\nsingle-view conditions.

To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel 3D Hierarchical\nProxy Node representation. Its core innovation lies in representing an object's\nshape and texture via a sparse set of hierarchically organized\n(tree-structured) proxy nodes distributed on its surface and interior. Each\nnode stores local shape and texture information (implicitly encoded by a small\nMLP) within its neighborhood. Querying any 3D coordinate's properties involves\nefficient neural interpolation and lightweight decoding from relevant nearby\nand parent nodes. This framework yields a highly compact representation where\nnodes align with local semantics, enabling direct drag-and-edit manipulation,\nand offers scalable quality-complexity control.

In\nprevious editions, the challenge used four-channel audio formats of first-order\nAmbisonics (FOA) and microphone array. In contrast, this year's challenge\ninvestigates SELD with stereo audio data (termed stereo SELD). This change\nshifts the focus from more specialized 360{\\deg} audio and audiovisual scene\nanalysis to more commonplace audio and media scenarios with limited\nfield-of-view (FOV). Due to inherent angular ambiguities in stereo audio data,\nthe task focuses on direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in the azimuth plane\n(left-right axis) along with distance estimation. The challenge remains divided\ninto two tracks: audio-only and audiovisual, with the audiovisual track\nintroducing a new sub-task of onscreen/offscreen event classification\nnecessitated by the limited FOV. This challenge introduces the DCASE2025 Task3\nStereo SELD Dataset, whose stereo audio and perspective video clips are sampled\nand converted from the STARSS23 recordings. The baseline system is designed to\nprocess stereo audio and corresponding video frames as inputs.

A key privacy issue in FRS is protecting the user's\nface template, as the characteristics of the user's face image can be recovered\nfrom the template. Although recent advances in cryptographic tools such as\nhomomorphic encryption (HE) have provided opportunities for securing the FRS,\nHE cannot be used directly with FRS in an efficient plug-and-play manner. In\nparticular, although HE is functionally complete for arbitrary programs, it is\nbasically designed for algebraic operations on encrypted data of predetermined\nshape, such as a polynomial ring. Thus, a non-tailored combination of HE and\nthe system can yield very inefficient performance, and many previous HE-based\nface template protection methods are hundreds of times slower than plain\nsystems without protection.

Our complexity\nanalysis shows that our method requires a relatively smaller number of\nparameters and achieves moderate training time, inference time, and throughput.\nFor further study, the source code of our method is available at\nhttps://github.com/anwarmaxsum/PROL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u589e\u957f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u9650\u5236\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u589e\u957f\u95ee\u9898\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5305\u62ec\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3001\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7f29\u653e-\u79fb\u4f4d\u5668\u3001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u786c\u8f6f\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u8f83\u5c11\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3/\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u9002\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), a promising\nbrain-inspired computational model, is integral to neuro-symbolic AI. Various\nHDC models have been proposed to represent class-instance and class-class\nrelations, but when representing the more complex class-subclass relation,\nwhere multiple objects associate different levels of classes and subclasses,\nthey face challenges for factorization, a crucial task for neuro-symbolic AI\nsystems. In this article, we propose FactorHD, a novel HDC model capable of\nrepresenting and factorizing the complex class-subclass relation efficiently.\nFactorHD features a symbolic encoding method that embeds an extra memorization\nclause, preserving more information for multiple objects. In addition, it\nemploys an efficient factorization algorithm that selectively eliminates\nredundant classes by identifying the memorization clause of the target class.\nSuch model significantly enhances computing efficiency and accuracy in\nrepresenting and factorizing multiple objects with class-subclass relation,\novercoming limitations of existing HDC models such as \"superposition\ncatastrophe\" and \"the problem of 2\".

Despite EEG's limited\nspatial resolution and high signal noise, we find that spatially coherent\nvisual input (i.e., continuous and structured motion) reliably evokes decodable\nspatial representations, aligning with participants' subjective sense of\nspatial engagement. Decoding performance further improves when visual input is\npresented at a frame rate of 100 ms per image, suggesting alignment with\nintrinsic neural temporal dynamics. Using gradient-based backpropagation\nthrough a neural decoding model, we identify distinct EEG channels contributing\nto position -- and orientation specific -- components, revealing a distributed\nyet complementary neural encoding scheme.
