Earth observation (EO) satellites provide critical, frequent coverage for mapping inundation, yet operational accuracy depends heavily on labeled datasets and model generalization. Recent Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs), such as ESA-IBM's TerraMind, offer improved generalizability through large-scale self-supervised pretraining, but their performance on diverse global flood events remains poorly understood.\n  We fine-tune TerraMind for flood extent mapping using FloodsNet, a harmonized multimodal dataset containing co-located Sentinel-1 (Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR data) and Sentinel-2 (optical) imagery for 85 flood events worldwide. We tested four configurations (base vs. large models; frozen vs. unfrozen backbones) and compared against the TerraMind Sen1Floods11 example and a U-Net trained on both FloodsNet and Sen1Floods11. The base-unfrozen configuration provided the best balance of accuracy, precision, and recall at substantially lower computational cost than the large model. The large unfrozen model achieved the highest recall. Models trained on FloodsNet outperformed the Sen1Floods11-trained example in recall with similar overall accuracy. U-Net achieved higher recall than all GFM configurations, though with slightly lower accuracy and precision.\n  Our results demonstrate that integrating multimodal optical and SAR data and fine-tuning a GFM can enhance near-real-time flood mapping. This study provides one of the first global-scale evaluations of a GFM for flood segmentation, highlighting both its potential and current limitations for climate adaptation and disaster resilience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03TerraMind\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u740385\u4e2a\u6d2a\u6c34\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684FloodsNet\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\u5728\u6d2a\u6c34\u8303\u56f4\u5236\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51bb\u914d\u7f6e\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d2a\u6c34\u662f\u6700\u5177\u7834\u574f\u6027\u7684\u5929\u6c14\u76f8\u5173\u707e\u5bb3\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c2024\u5e74\u6781\u7aef\u6d2a\u6c34\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5f71\u54cd\u4e94\u5927\u6d32\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5730\u7403\u89c2\u6d4b\u536b\u661f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u6d2a\u6c34\u76d1\u6d4b\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u4f46\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1ESA-IBM\u7684TerraMind\u7b49\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u5168\u7403\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6d2a\u6c34\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b\u5168\u740385\u4e2a\u6d2a\u6c34\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684FloodsNet\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u542bSentinel-1 SAR\u548cSentinel-2\u5149\u5b66\u534f\u540c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5f71\u50cf\uff09\u5bf9TerraMind\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\uff08\u57fa\u7840vs\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u51bb\u7ed3vs\u89e3\u51bb\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eTerraMind Sen1Floods11\u793a\u4f8b\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728FloodsNet\u548cSen1Floods11\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684U-Net\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51bb\u914d\u7f6e\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5927\u578b\u89e3\u51bb\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3002\u5728FloodsNet\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eSen1Floods11\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002U-Net\u6bd4\u6240\u6709GFM\u914d\u7f6e\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u7565\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5149\u5b66\u548cSAR\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u6d2a\u6c34\u5236\u56fe\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u5168\u7403\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8bc4\u4f30GFM\u7528\u4e8e\u6d2a\u6c34\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u65e2\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6c14\u5019\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u707e\u5bb3\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e5f\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Published in IEEE Transactions on Multimedia. Code available at: https://github.com/hdeng26/Contex", "summary": "Contrastive learning has gained popularity and pushes state-of-the-art performance across numerous large-scale benchmarks. In contrastive learning, the contrastive loss function plays a pivotal role in discerning similarities between samples through techniques such as rotation or cropping. However, this learning mechanism can also introduce information distortion from the augmented samples. This is because the trained model may develop a significant overreliance on information from samples with identical labels, while concurrently neglecting positive pairs that originate from the same initial image, especially in expansive datasets. This paper proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function that concurrently improves learning effectiveness and addresses the information distortion by encompassing two convergence targets. The first component, which is notably sensitive to label contrast, differentiates between features of identical and distinct classes which boosts the contrastive training efficiency. Meanwhile, the second component draws closer the augmented samples from the same source image and distances all other samples. We evaluate the proposed approach on image classification tasks, which are among the most widely accepted 8 recognition large-scale benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, and CelebA datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improvements over 16 state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods in terms of both generalization performance and learning convergence speed. Interestingly, our technique stands out in addressing systematic distortion tasks. It demonstrates a 22.9% improvement compared to original contrastive loss functions in the downstream BiasedMNIST dataset, highlighting its promise for more efficient and equitable downstream training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u6536\u655b\u76ee\u6807\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u4fe1\u606f\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u76f8\u540c\u6807\u7b7e\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u6765\u81ea\u540c\u4e00\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6b63\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) \u5bf9\u6807\u7b7e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u654f\u611f\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u76f8\u540c\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2) \u62c9\u8fd1\u6765\u81ea\u540c\u4e00\u6e90\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a8\u8fdc\u6240\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u6837\u672c", "result": "\u57288\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd416\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5728BiasedMNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u534722.9%", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5931\u771f\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa"}}

The diversity of such errors underscores the need for a hierarchical evaluation framework that can compare prompt adherence abilities of different image generation models. Simultaneously, benchmarks of vision language models (VLMs) have not kept pace with the complexity of scenes that VLMs are used to annotate. In this work, we propose a structured methodology for jointly evaluating T2I models and VLMs by testing whether VLMs can identify 27 specific failure modes in the images generated by T2I models conditioned on challenging prompts. Our second contribution is a dataset of prompts and images generated by 5 T2I models (Flux, SD3-Medium, SD3-Large, SD3.5-Medium, SD3.5-Large) and the corresponding annotations from VLMs (Molmo, InternVL3, Pixtral) annotated by an LLM (Llama3) to test whether VLMs correctly identify the failure mode in a generated image. By analyzing failure modes on a curated set of prompts, we reveal systematic errors in attribute fidelity and object representation.

At subsequent stages of patient diagnosis, genetic information is extracted to help select specific patient treatment options. As the efficacy of cancer treatment often relies on early diagnosis and treatment, we build a deep latent variable model to determine patients' somatic mutation profiles based on their corresponding medical images. We first introduce a point cloud representation of lesions images to allow for invariance to the imaging modality. We then propose, LLOST, a model with dual variational autoencoders coupled together by a separate shared latent space that unifies features from the lesion point clouds and counts of distinct somatic mutations. Therefore our model consists of three latent space, each of which is learned with a conditional normalizing flow prior to account for the diverse distributions of each domain. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on de-identified medical images from The Cancer Imaging Archive and the corresponding somatic mutations from the Pan Cancer dataset of The Cancer Genomic Archive. We show the model's predictive performance on the counts of specific mutations as well as it's ability to accurately predict the occurrence of mutations. In particular, shared patterns between the imaging and somatic mutation domain that reflect cancer type.

A natural strategy is to apply super-resolution (SR) to low-resolution (LR) input views, but independently enhancing each image introduces multi-view inconsistencies, leading to blurry renders. Prior methods attempt to mitigate these inconsistencies through learned neural components, temporally consistent video priors, or joint optimization on LR and SR views, but all uniformly apply SR across every image. In contrast, our key insight is that close-up LR views may contain high-frequency information for regions also captured in more distant views, and that we can use the camera pose relative to scene geometry to inform where to add SR content. Building from this insight, we propose SplatSuRe, a method that selectively applies SR content only in undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision, yielding sharper and more consistent results.

Current literature for tackling generalisation on out-of-distribution data and domain gaps due to modality changes has been widely researched but mostly for natural scene data. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to the surgical scenes due to limited visual cues and often extremely diverse scenarios compared to the natural scene data. Inspired by these works in natural scenes to push generalisability on OOD data, we hypothesise that exploiting the style and content information in the surgical scenes could minimise the appearances, making it less variable to sudden changes such as blood or imaging artefacts. This can be achieved by performing instance normalisation and feature covariance mapping techniques for robust and generalisable feature representations. Further, to eliminate the risk of removing salient feature representation associated with the objects of interest, we introduce a restitution module within the feature learning ResNet backbone that can enable the retention of useful task-relevant features. To tackle the lack of multiclass and multicentre data for surgical scene segmentation, we also provide a newly curated dataset that can be vital for addressing generalisability in this domain. Our proposed RobustSurg obtained nearly 23% improvement on the baseline DeepLabv3+ and from 10-32% improvement on the SOTA in terms of mean IoU score on an unseen centre HeiCholSeg dataset when trained on CholecSeg8K. Similarly, RobustSurg also obtained nearly 22% improvement over the baseline and nearly 11% improvement on a recent SOTA method for the target set of the EndoUDA polyp dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRobustSurg\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u5206\u5e03\uff08\u5176\u4ed6\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff09\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u6a21\u6001\u3002\u81ea\u7136\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u573a\u666f\u6781\u5176\u591a\u6837\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u6620\u5c04\u6280\u672f\u6765\u5229\u7528\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5916\u89c2\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5728ResNet\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u6062\u590d\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6709\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u7c7b\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u4e2d\u5fc3HeiCholSeg\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebfDeepLabv3+\u63d0\u5347\u8fd123%\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534710-32%\uff08mIoU\uff09\u3002\u5728EndoUDA\u606f\u8089\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347\u8fd122%\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u65b0SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u8fd111%\u3002", "conclusion": "RobustSurg\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u53ca\u7279\u5f81\u6062\u590d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u5206\u5272\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing end-to-end multifractal methods rely on heavy pooling or strong feature-space decimation, which constrain tasks such as semantic segmentation. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce two inductive priors: Monofractal and Multifractal Recalibration. These methods leverage relationships between the probability mass of the exponents and the multifractal spectrum to form statistical descriptions of encoder embeddings, implemented as channel-attention functions in convolutional networks.\n  Using a U-Net-based framework, we show that multifractal recalibration yields substantial gains over a baseline equipped with other channel-attention mechanisms that also use higher-order statistics. Given the proven ability of multifractal analysis to capture pathological regularities, we validate our approach on three public medical-imaging datasets: ISIC18 (dermoscopy), Kvasir-SEG (endoscopy), and BUSI (ultrasound).\n  Our empirical analysis also provides insights into the behavior of these attention layers. We find that excitation responses do not become increasingly specialized with encoder depth in U-Net architectures due to skip connections, and that their effectiveness may relate to global statistics of instance variability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5f52\u7eb3\u5148\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5355\u5206\u5f62\u548c\u591a\u5206\u5f62\u91cd\u65b0\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6307\u6570\u6982\u7387\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u591a\u5206\u5f62\u8c31\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5f62\u6210\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5728\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3a\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u591a\u5206\u5f62\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6c60\u5316\u6216\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u964d\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u591a\u5206\u5f62\u5206\u6790\u5728\u6355\u6349\u75c5\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u65b9\u9762\u5df2\u8bc1\u660e\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u5f52\u7eb3\u5148\u9a8c\uff1a\u5355\u5206\u5f62\u548c\u591a\u5206\u5f62\u91cd\u65b0\u6821\u51c6\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u6307\u6570\u6982\u7387\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u591a\u5206\u5f62\u8c31\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5f62\u6210\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5728\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3a\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u4f7f\u7528U-Net\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u5206\u5f62\u91cd\u65b0\u6821\u51c6\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u9636\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u5206\u5f62\u91cd\u65b0\u6821\u51c6\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u5176\u4ed6\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08ISIC18\u76ae\u80a4\u955c\u3001Kvasir-SEG\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u3001BUSI\u8d85\u58f0\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728U-Net\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u6fc0\u52b1\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0d\u4f1a\u968f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6df1\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u53d8\u5f97\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\uff0c\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u7edf\u8ba1\u6709\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u5206\u5f62\u91cd\u65b0\u6821\u51c6\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u75c5\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u5e76\u53d6\u5f97\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u5728U-Net\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u5206\u5f62\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

These approaches cannot provide diagnostic, interpretable feedback, offering little insight into why the video quality is degraded. Most of them are also specialized, format-specific metrics rather than truly ``generic\" solutions, as they are designed to learn a compromised representation from disparate perceptual domains. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Unified-VQA, a framework that provides a single, unified quality model applicable to various distortion types within multiple video formats by recasting generic VQA as a Diagnostic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) problem. Unified-VQA employs multiple ``perceptual experts'' dedicated to distinct perceptual domains. A novel multi-proxy expert training strategy is designed to optimize each expert using a ranking-inspired loss, guided by the most suitable proxy metric for its domain. We also integrated a diagnostic multi-task head into this framework to generate a global quality score and an interpretable multi-dimensional artifact vector, which is optimized using a weakly-supervised learning strategy, leveraging the known properties of the large-scale training database generated for this work. With static model parameters (without retraining or fine-tuning), Unified-VQA demonstrates consistent and superior performance compared to over 18 benchmark methods for both generic VQA and diagnostic artifact detection tasks across 17 databases containing diverse streaming artifacts in HD, UHD, HDR and HFR formats.

We introduce AV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused on speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception.

Taking image deraining as an example, this study addresses the representation of the inherent high-pass characteristics of spiking neurons, specifically in image deraining and innovatively proposes the Visual LIF (VLIF) neuron, overcoming the obstacle of lacking spatial contextual understanding present in traditional spiking neurons. To tackle the limitation of frequency-domain saturation inherent in conventional spiking neurons, we leverage the proposed VLIF to introduce the Spiking Decomposition and Enhancement Module and the lightweight Spiking Multi-scale Unit for hierarchical multi-scale representation learning. Extensive experiments across five benchmark deraining datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SNN-based deraining methods, achieving this superior performance with only 13\\% of their energy consumption.

Previous generative approaches rely on weather-scale autoregression for climate emulation, but this is inherently slow for long climate horizons and has yet to demonstrate stable rollouts under nonstationary forcings. Here, we introduce Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF), a new class of flow matching approaches that model data hierarchically across spatial and temporal scales. Inspired by cascaded video models, SPF partitions the generative trajectory into a spatiotemporal pyramid, progressively increasing spatial resolution to reduce computation and coupling each stage with an associated timescale to enable direct sampling at any temporal level in the pyramid. This design, together with conditioning each stage on prescribed physical forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases or aerosols), enables efficient, parallel climate emulation at multiple timescales. On ClimateBench, SPF outperforms strong flow matching baselines and pre-trained models at yearly and monthly timescales while offering fast sampling, especially at coarser temporal levels. To scale SPF, we curate ClimateSuite, the largest collection of Earth system simulations to date, comprising over 33,000 simulation-years across ten climate models and the first dataset to include simulations of climate interventions.

In this work, we repurpose CogVideo for progressive visual restoration tasks by fine-tuning it to generate restoration trajectories rather than natural video motion. Specifically, we construct synthetic datasets for super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement, where each sample depicts a gradual transition from degraded to clean frames. Two prompting strategies are compared: a uniform text prompt shared across all samples, and a scene-specific prompting scheme generated via LLaVA multi-modal LLM and refined with ChatGPT. Our fine-tuned model learns to associate temporal progression with restoration quality, producing sequences that improve perceptual metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS across frames. Extensive experiments show that CogVideo effectively restores spatial detail and illumination consistency while maintaining temporal coherence.

Although supervised trackers show promise, contemporary self-supervised trackers struggle when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting their scalability and generalization without extensive labeled data. We find that pre-trained video diffusion models inherently learn motion representations suitable for tracking without task-specific training. This ability arises because their denoising process isolates motion in early, high-noise stages, distinct from later appearance refinement. Capitalizing on this discovery, our self-supervised tracker significantly improves performance in distinguishing visually similar objects, an underexplored failure point for existing methods. Our method achieves up to a 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and our newly introduced tests focused on tracking visually similar items.

However, when deployed in online settings such as driving scenarios, predictions are made over temporal windows, making it non-trivial to maintain consistency across time. Recent strategies align consecutive predictions by solving global transformation, yet our analysis reveals their fundamental limitations in assumption validity, local alignment scope, and robustness under noisy geometry. In this work, we propose a higher-DOF and long-term alignment framework based on Thin Plate Spline, leveraging globally propagated control points to correct spatially varying inconsistencies. In addition, we adopt a point-agnostic submap registration design that is inherently robust to noisy geometry predictions. The proposed framework is fully plug-and-play, compatible with diverse 3D foundation models and camera configurations (e.g., monocular or surround-view). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields more coherent geometry and lower trajectory errors across multiple datasets, backbone models, and camera setups, highlighting its robustness and generality.

Improving the interpretability of CNNs is thus of great importance for their development and deployment in SAR. In this paper, a visual explanation method termed multi-weight self-matching class activation mapping (MS-CAM) is proposed. MS-CAM matches SAR images with the feature maps and corresponding gradients extracted by the CNN, and combines both channel-wise and element-wise weights to visualize the decision basis learned by the model in SAR images. Extensive experiments conducted on a self-constructed SAR target classification dataset demonstrate that MS-CAM more accurately highlights the network's regions of interest and captures detailed target feature information, thereby enhancing network interpretability.

Recent efforts pursue unified multimodal models that integrate heterogeneous components to support both capabilities within a single framework. However, such unification introduces inference inefficiencies, e.g., specific tasks or samples may not require the full knowledge or capacity of the unified model. Yet, a systematic understanding of how these inefficiencies manifest across different components remains limited. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of unified multimodal model components using training-free pruning as a probing methodology, considering both depth pruning and width reduction. Our study reveals that the understanding component exhibits notable compressibility in both understanding and generation tasks, which is more pronounced in the latter. In contrast, the generation components are highly sensitive to compression, with performance deteriorating sharply even under moderate compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adaptation, inspired by the dynamic activation patterns observed across different samples. This approach partitions the generation module into multiple experts and enables sparse activation to restore generation quality.

Existing deep-learning multi-view crowd counting methods project different camera view images onto a common space to obtain ground-plane density maps, requiring abundant and costly crowd annotations and camera calibrations. Hence, calibration-free methods are proposed that do not require camera calibrations and scene-level crowd annotations. However, existing calibration-free methods still require expensive image-level crowd annotations for training the single-view counting module. Thus, in this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised calibration-free multi-view crowd counting method (WSCF-MVCC), directly using crowd count as supervision for the single-view counting module rather than density maps constructed from crowd annotations. Instead, a self-supervised ranking loss that leverages multi-scale priors is utilized to enhance the model's perceptual ability without additional annotation costs. What's more, the proposed model leverages semantic information to achieve a more accurate view matching and, consequently, a more precise scene-level crowd count estimation. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three widely used multi-view counting datasets under weakly supervised settings, indicating that it is more suitable for practical deployment compared with calibrated methods.

Consequently, they may struggle with basic perception tasks that conventional models handle reliably. Given the substantial cost of pre-training and fine-tuning VLMs, continue training on augmented data yields limited and diminishing returns. In this paper, we present Visual Augmentation Chain-of-Thought (VACoT), a framework that dynamically invokes image augmentations during model inference. By incorporating post-hoc transformations such as denoising, VACoT substantially improves robustness on challenging and out-of-distribution inputs, especially in OCR-related adversarial scenarios. Distinct from prior approaches limited to local cropping, VACoT integrates a structured collection of general visual augmentations, broadening the query image views while reducing training complexity and computational overhead with efficient agentic reinforcement learning. We propose a conditional reward scheme that encourages necessary augmentation while penalizing verbose responses, ensuring concise and effective reasoning in perception tasks. We demonstrate the superiority of VACoT with extensive experiments on 13 perception benchmarks and further introduce AdvOCR to highlight the generalization benefits of post-hoc visual augmentations in adversarial scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "VACoT\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u5904\u7406\u53d8\u6362\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6297\u6027OCR\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6216\u5408\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u6536\u76ca\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c31\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVACoT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\uff08\u5982\u53bb\u566a\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u589e\u5f3a\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u572813\u4e2a\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728OCR\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165AdvOCR\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u5c55\u793a\u540e\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "VACoT\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

TB, a persistent infectious disease affecting humanity for millennia, poses challenges in diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings. Traditional methods, such as sputum smear microscopy and culture, are inefficient, prompting the exploration of advanced technologies like deep learning and computer vision. The study utilized a dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 4,200 chest X-rays, to develop and compare the performance of the two machine learning models. Preprocessing involved data splitting, augmentation, and resizing to enhance training efficiency. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, were employed to assess model performance. Results showcase that the SqueezeNet achieved a loss of 32%, accuracy of 89%, precision of 98%, recall of 80%, and an F1 score of 87%. In contrast, the ResNet-50 model exhibited a loss of 54%, accuracy of 73%, precision of 88%, recall of 52%, and an F1 score of 65%. This study emphasizes the potential of machine learning in TB detection and possible implications for early identification and treatment initiation. The possibility of integrating such models into mobile devices expands their utility in areas lacking TB detection resources.

However, in many real-world scenarios, we are unable to access the model parameters and architectural details due to privacy concerns and security constraints. Traditional fine-tuning or adaptation is hindered, leading to the demand for input-level strategies that can enhance generalization without modifying model weights. To this end, we propose a \\textbf{S}tyle-\\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{GE}neralization framework (\\textbf{SAGE}), which improves the generalization of frozen models under privacy constraints. SAGE learns to synthesize visual prompts that implicitly align feature distributions across styles instead of directly fine-tuning the backbone. Specifically, we first utilize style transfer to construct a diverse style representation of the source domain, thereby learning a set of style characteristics that can cover a wide range of visual features. Then, the model adaptively fuses these style cues according to the visual context of each input, forming a dynamic prompt that harmonizes the image appearance without touching the interior of the model. Through this closed-loop design, SAGE effectively bridges the gap between frozen model invariance and the diversity of unseen domains.

However, most existing methods focus on processing captured images or sequential frames in real time, without explicitly evaluating the quality of the on-the-go 3D reconstruction or providing guided feedback to enhance image acquisition in the target area. This work presents On-the-fly Feedback SfM, an explore-and-exploit framework for real-time UAV photogrammetry, enabling iterative exploration of unseen regions and exploitation of already observed and reconstructed areas in near real time. Built upon SfM on-the-fly , the proposed method integrates three modules: (1) online incremental coarse-mesh generation for dynamically expanding sparse 3D point cloud; (2) online mesh quality assessment with actionable indicators; and (3) predictive path planning for on-the-fly trajectory refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves in-situ reconstruction and evaluation in near real time while providing actionable feedback that markedly reduces coverage gaps and re-flight costs. Via the integration of data collection, processing, 3D reconstruction and assessment, and online feedback, our on the-fly feedback SfM could be an alternative for the transition from traditional passive working mode to a more intelligent and adaptive exploration workflow.

Despite their strong detection performance, these methods suffer from relatively low association accuracy. Through detailed analysis, we observe that object embeddings produced by the shared DETR architecture display excessively high inter-object similarity, as it emphasizes only category-level discrimination within single frames. In contrast, tracking requires instance-level distinction across frames with spatial and temporal continuity, for which current end-to-end approaches insufficiently optimize object embeddings. To address this, we introduce FDTA (From Detection to Association), an explicit feature refinement framework that enhances object discriminativeness across three complementary perspectives. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial Adapter (SA) to integrate depth-aware cues for spatial continuity, a Temporal Adapter (TA) to aggregate historical information for temporal dependencies, and an Identity Adapter (IA) to leverage quality-aware contrastive learning for instance-level separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FDTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging MOT benchmarks, including DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BFT, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed discriminative embedding enhancement strategy.

The RaDelft data set, although seminal, provides only LiDAR annotations and no public code to generate radar labels, limiting reproducibility and downstream research. In this work, we reproduce the numerical results of the RaDelft group and demonstrate that a camera-guided radar labeling pipeline can generate accurate labels for radar point clouds without relying on human annotations. By projecting radar point clouds into camera-based semantic segmentation and applying spatial clustering, we create labels that significantly enhance the accuracy of radar labels. These results establish a reproducible framework that allows the research community to train and evaluate the labeled 4D radar data.

To address these challenges, we propose Nav-$R^2$, a framework that explicitly models two critical types of relationships, target-environment modeling and environment-action planning, through structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning coupled with a Similarity-Aware Memory. We construct a Nav$R^2$-CoT dataset that teaches the model to perceive the environment, focus on target-related objects in the surrounding context and finally make future action plans. Our SA-Mem preserves the most target-relevant and current observation-relevant features from both temporal and semantic perspectives by compressing video frames and fusing historical observations, while introducing no additional parameters. Compared to previous methods, Nav-R^2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in localizing unseen objects through a streamlined and efficient pipeline, avoiding overfitting to seen object categories while maintaining real-time inference at 2Hz.

Multi-agent debate (MAD) has emerged as a popular way to leverage these strengths for robust reasoning, though it has mostly been applied to language-only tasks, leaving its efficacy on multimodal problems underexplored. In this paper, we study MAD for solving vision-and-language reasoning problems. Our setup enables generalizing the debate protocol with heterogeneous experts that possess single- and multi-modal capabilities. To this end, we present Weighted Iterative Society-of-Experts (WISE), a generalized and modular MAD framework that partitions the agents into Solvers, that generate solutions, and Reflectors, that verify correctness, assign weights, and provide natural language feedback. To aggregate the agents' solutions across debate rounds, while accounting for variance in their responses and the feedback weights, we present a modified Dawid-Skene algorithm for post-processing that integrates our two-stage debate model. We evaluate WISE on SMART-840, VisualPuzzles, EvoChart-QA, and a new SMART-840++ dataset with programmatically generated problem instances of controlled difficulty.

However, existing methods optimized for standard metrics often struggle to detect thin structural components and yield masks with irregular boundaries, lacking the geometric precision required for subsequent vectorization. To address this issue, we introduce MitUNet, a hybrid neural network architecture specifically designed for wall segmentation tasks in the context of 3D modeling. In MitUNet, we utilize a hierarchical Mix-Transformer encoder to capture global context and a U-Net decoder enhanced with scSE attention blocks for precise boundary recovery. Furthermore, we propose an optimization strategy based on the Tversky loss function to effectively balance precision and recall. By fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the loss function, we prioritize the suppression of false positive noise along wall boundaries while maintaining high sensitivity to thin structures. Our experiments on the public CubiCasa5k dataset and a proprietary regional dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures the generation of structurally correct masks with high boundary accuracy, outperforming standard single-task models.

Current methods typically fine-tune a universal model on the entire dataset, which potentially compromises the ability to generalize to unseen domains. To fill this gap, we provide a theoretical understanding of the generalization ability for VLM fine-tuning, which reveals that training multiple parameter-efficient expert models on partitioned source domains leads to better generalization than fine-tuning a universal model. Inspired by this finding, we propose a two-step domain-expert-Guided DG (GuiDG) framework. GuiDG first employs prompt tuning to obtain source domain experts, then introduces a Cross-Modal Attention module to guide the fine-tuning of the vision encoder via adaptive expert integration.

To address this limitation, we introduce GUI Exploration Lab, a simulation environment engine for GUI agent navigation research that enables flexible definition and composition of screens, icons, and navigation graphs, while providing full access to environment information for comprehensive agent training and evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we find that supervised fine-tuning enables effective memorization of fundamental knowledge, serving as a crucial foundation for subsequent training. Building on this, single-turn reinforcement learning further enhances generalization to unseen scenarios. Finally, multi-turn reinforcement learning encourages the development of exploration strategies through interactive trial and error, leading to further improvements in screen navigation performance. We validate our methods on both static and interactive benchmarks, demonstrating that our findings generalize effectively to real-world scenarios.

However, scaling them to hours- or days-long videos remains highly challenging due to limited context capacity and the loss of critical visual details during abstraction. Existing memory-augmented methods mitigate this by leveraging textual summaries of video segments, yet they heavily rely on text and fail to utilize visual evidence when reasoning over complex scenes. Moreover, retrieving from fixed temporal scales further limits their flexibility in capturing events that span variable durations. To address this, we introduce WorldMM, a novel multimodal memory agent that constructs and retrieves from multiple complementary memories, encompassing both textual and visual representations. WorldMM comprises three types of memory: episodic memory indexes factual events across multiple temporal scales, semantic memory continuously updates high-level conceptual knowledge, and visual memory preserves detailed information about scenes. During inference, an adaptive retrieval agent iteratively selects the most relevant memory source and leverages multiple temporal granularities based on the query, continuing until it determines that sufficient information has been gathered.

Mainly characterized by dimmed and blurred visions, or peripheral vision loss, glaucoma is well known to occur due to damages in the optic nerve from increased intraocular pressure (IOP) or neovascularization within the retina. Traditionally, most glaucoma related works and clinical diagnosis focused on detecting these damages in the optic nerve by using patient data from perimetry tests, optic papilla inspections and tonometer-based IOP measurements. Recently, with advancements in computer vision AI models, such as VGG16 or Vision Transformers (ViT), AI-automatized glaucoma detection and optic cup segmentation based on retinal fundus images or OCT recently exhibited significant performance in aiding conventional diagnosis with high performance. However, current AI-driven glaucoma detection approaches still have significant room for improvement in terms of reliability, excessive parameter usage, possibility of spurious correlation within detection, and limitations in applications to intervention analysis or clinical simulations. Thus, this research introduced a novel causal representation driven glaucoma detection model: LightHCG, an extremely lightweight Convolutional VAE-based latent glaucoma representation model that can consider the true causality among glaucoma-related physical factors within the optic nerve region. Using HSIC-based latent space disentanglement and Graph Autoencoder based unsupervised causal representation learning, LightHCG not only exhibits higher performance in classifying glaucoma with 93~99% less weights, but also enhances the possibility of AI-driven intervention analysis, compared to existing advanced vision models such as InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 or VGG16.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLightHCG\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9752\u5149\u773c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5377\u79efVAE\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c1193-99%\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9752\u5149\u773c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u7684\u81f4\u76f2\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8bca\u65ad\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u91ce\u68c0\u67e5\u3001\u89c6\u76d8\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u773c\u538b\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002\u73b0\u6709AI\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u3001\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLightHCG\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5377\u79efVAE\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528HSIC\uff08\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279-\u65bd\u5bc6\u7279\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u51c6\u5219\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u9752\u5149\u773c\u76f8\u5173\u7269\u7406\u56e0\u7d20\u95f4\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9752\u5149\u773c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4InceptionV3\u3001MobileNetV2\u3001VGG16\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c1193-99%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AI\u9a71\u52a8\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LightHCG\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7684\u9752\u5149\u773c\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Pretrained VLMs enable fine-tuning on small datasets or zero-shot inference, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models. Contrastive learning (CL) is a key paradigm for training VLMs but inherently requires large batch sizes for effective learning, making it computationally demanding and often limited to well-resourced institutions. Moreover, with limited data in healthcare, it is important to prioritize knowledge extraction from both data and models during training to improve performance. Therefore, we focus on leveraging the momentum method combined with distillation to simultaneously address computational efficiency and knowledge exploitation. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) leveraging momentum self-distillation to enhance multimodal learning, and (2) integrating momentum mechanisms with gradient accumulation to enlarge the effective batch size without increasing resource consumption. Our method attains competitive performance with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in zero-shot classification, while providing a substantial boost in the few-shot adaption, achieving over 90% AUC-ROC and improving retrieval tasks by 2-3%. Importantly, our method achieves high training efficiency with a single GPU while maintaining reasonable training time.

Meta-learning approaches explicitly learn good initializations, but they require an additional meta-training phase over many tasks, incur high training cost, and can be unstable. At the same time, the number of task-specific pre-trained models continues to grow, yet the question of how to transfer them to new tasks with minimal additional training remains relatively underexplored. We propose BOLT (Basis-Oriented Low-rank Transfer), a framework that reuses existing fine-tuned models not by merging weights, but instead by extracting an orthogonal, task-informed spectral basis and adapting within that subspace. In the offline phase, BOLT collects dominant singular directions from multiple task vectors and orthogonalizes them per layer to form reusable bases. In the online phase, we freeze these bases and train only a small set of diagonal coefficients per layer for the new task, yielding a rank-controlled update with very few trainable parameters. This design provides (i) a strong, training-free initialization for unseen tasks, obtained by pooling source-task coefficients, along with a lightweight rescaling step while leveraging the shared orthogonal bases, and (ii) a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) path that, in our experiments, achieves robust performance compared to common PEFT baselines as well as a representative meta-learned initialization.

However, existing SNNs typically replicate inputs directly or aggregate them into frames at fixed intervals. Such strategies lead to neurons receiving nearly identical stimuli across time steps, severely limiting the model's expressive power, particularly in complex tasks like object detection. In this work, we propose the Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE) to strengthen SNNs' capacity for temporal information modeling. TDE consists of two modules: a Spiking Encoder (SE) that generates diverse input stimuli across time steps, and an Attention Gating Module (AGM) that guides the SE generation based on inter-temporal dependencies. Moreover, to eliminate the high-energy multiplication operations introduced by the AGM, we propose a Spike-Driven Attention (SDA) to reduce attention-related energy consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TDE can be seamlessly integrated into existing SNN-based detectors and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving mAP50-95 scores of 57.7% on the static PASCAL VOC dataset and 47.6% on the neuromorphic EvDET200K dataset. In terms of energy consumption, the SDA consumes only 0.240 times the energy of conventional attention modules.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTDE\u589e\u5f3aSNN\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u523a\u6fc0\u7684SE\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\u6307\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u7684AGM\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7SDA\u964d\u4f4e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709SNN\u901a\u5e38\u76f4\u63a5\u590d\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u6216\u6309\u56fa\u5b9a\u95f4\u9694\u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u5e27\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u63a5\u6536\u51e0\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u523a\u6fc0\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u5982\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTDE\uff08\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u6001\u589e\u5f3a\u5668\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1\uff09SE\uff08\u8109\u51b2\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff09\u751f\u6210\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8f93\u5165\u523a\u6fc0\uff1b2\uff09AGM\uff08\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u95e8\u63a7\u6a21\u5757\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u5e8f\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u6307\u5bfcSE\u751f\u6210\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSDA\uff08\u8109\u51b2\u9a71\u52a8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\u6d88\u9664AGM\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u9ad8\u80fd\u8017\u4e58\u6cd5\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "TDE\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709SNN\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u9759\u6001PASCAL VOC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523057.7% mAP50-95\uff0c\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001EvDET200K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523047.6%\u3002SDA\u80fd\u8017\u4ec5\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u76840.240\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "TDE\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3aSNN\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3aSNN\u5728\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

As a data-driven approach, Deep Learning relies on vast amounts of driving data, typically labeled in great detail. As a result, datasets, alongside hardware and algorithms, are foundational building blocks for the development of AVs. In this work we revisit one of the most widely used autonomous driving datasets: the nuScenes dataset. nuScenes exemplifies key trends in AV development, being the first dataset to include radar data, to feature diverse urban driving scenes from two continents, and to be collected using a fully autonomous vehicle operating on public roads, while also promoting multi-modal sensor fusion, standardized benchmarks, and a broad range of tasks including perception, localization \\& mapping, prediction and planning. We provide an unprecedented look into the creation of nuScenes, as well as its extensions nuImages and Panoptic nuScenes, summarizing many technical details that have hitherto not been revealed in academic publications. Furthermore, we trace how the influence of nuScenes impacted a large number of other datasets that were released later and how it defined numerous standards that are used by the community to this day. Finally, we present an overview of both official and unofficial tasks using the nuScenes dataset and review major methodological developments, thereby offering a comprehensive survey of the autonomous driving literature, with a particular focus on nuScenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u56de\u987e\u4e86nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u9886\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u5176\u521b\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3001\u6280\u672f\u7ec6\u8282\u3001\u5bf9\u540e\u7eed\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u800c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u786c\u4ef6\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e00\u6837\u662f\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002nuScenes\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6700\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86AV\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u8bb8\u591a\u6280\u672f\u7ec6\u8282\u5728\u5b66\u672f\u51fa\u7248\u7269\u4e2d\u5c1a\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u516c\u5f00\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u8ba8nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u521b\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u7248\u672cnuImages\u548cPanoptic nuScenes\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u672a\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u6280\u672f\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8ffd\u8e2anuScenes\u5bf9\u540e\u7eed\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u884c\u4e1a\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u7efc\u8ff0\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "nuScenes\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u3001\u6db5\u76d6\u4e24\u5927\u6d32\u57ce\u5e02\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u516c\u5171\u9053\u8def\u4e0a\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u5b83\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5efa\u56fe\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9\u540e\u7eed\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u6df1\u8fdc\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u793e\u533a\u81f3\u4eca\u4ecd\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u4f17\u591a\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cc\u7a0b\u7891\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd8\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u884c\u4e1a\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5168\u9762\u56de\u987e\u4e86nuScenes\u7684\u521b\u5efa\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6587\u732e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4ee5nuScenes\u4e3a\u91cd\u70b9\u7684\u5168\u9762\u7efc\u8ff0\u3002"}}

However, capturing intra-style diversity, where a single style should correspond to diverse motion variations, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based framework, ClusterStyle, to address this limitation. Instead of learning an unstructured embedding from each style motion, we leverage a set of prototypes to effectively model diverse style patterns across motions belonging to the same style category. We consider two types of style diversity: global-level diversity among style motions of the same category, and local-level diversity within the temporal dynamics of motion sequences.

However, effective multimodal reasoning requires both accurate perception and robust reasoning, and weakness in either limits the performance of VLMs. Prior efforts to enhance reasoning often depend on high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data, obtained via labor-intensive human annotations, costly proprietary models, or self-training methods that overlook perception. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective self-training framework called See-Think-Learn (STL). At its core, STL introduces a structured reasoning template that encourages the model to see before thinking, first extracting visual attributes in textual form, then using them to guide reasoning. The framework jointly improves perception and reasoning by having the model generate and learn from its own structured rationales in a self-training loop. Furthermore, we augment the training data with negative rationales, i.e. explanations that justify why certain answer choices are incorrect, to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between correct and misleading responses. This fosters more discriminative and robust learning. Experiments across diverse domains show that STL consistently outperforms baselines trained directly only on answers or self-generated reasoning, while qualitative analysis confirms the high quality of its rationales.

We pose a fundamental question: Does audio-video joint denoising training improve video generation, even when we only care about video quality? To study this, we introduce a parameter-efficient Audio-Video Full DiT (AVFullDiT) architecture that leverages pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) and text-to-audio (T2A) modules for joint denoising. We train (i) a T2AV model with AVFullDiT and (ii) a T2V-only counterpart under identical settings. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that audio-video joint denoising can deliver more than synchrony. We observe consistent improvements on challenging subsets featuring large and object contact motions. We hypothesize that predicting audio acts as a privileged signal, encouraging the model to internalize causal relationships between visual events and their acoustic consequences (e.g., collision $\\times$ impact sound), which in turn regularizes video dynamics.

Meanwhile, it introduces a distribution constraint regularization to reduce class overlap. This design helps synthetic data preserve both semantic diversity and representativeness, improving performance in downstream tasks. Without additional optimization overhead, TGDD achieves a favorable balance between performance and efficiency. Experiments on ten datasets demonstrate that TGDD achieves state-of-the-art performance, notably a 5.0% accuracy gain on high-resolution benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "TGDD\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "TGDD\u5c06\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u9f50\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5e03\u7ea6\u675f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u7c7b\u522b\u91cd\u53e0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5341\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTGDD\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u4e865.0%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "TGDD\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Temporally- and spatially-consistent, long-term world modeling has been a long-standing problem, unresolved with even recent state-of-the-art models, due to the prohibitively expensive computational costs for long-context inputs. In this paper, we propose WorldPack, a video world model with efficient compressed memory, which significantly improves spatial consistency, fidelity, and quality in long-term generation despite much shorter context length. Our compressed memory consists of trajectory packing and memory retrieval; trajectory packing realizes high context efficiency, and memory retrieval maintains the consistency in rollouts and helps long-term generations that require spatial reasoning.

Recent multi-agent frameworks simulate Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) debates to mitigate single-model bias, but open-ended discussions amplify textual noise and computational cost while failing to anchor reasoning to visual evidence, the cornerstone of medical decision-making. We propose UCAgents, a hierarchical multi-agent framework enforcing unidirectional convergence through structured evidence auditing. Inspired by clinical workflows, UCAgents forbids position changes and limits agent interactions to targeted evidence verification, suppressing rhetorical drift while amplifying visual signal extraction. In UCAgents, a one-round inquiry discussion is introduced to uncover potential risks of visual-textual misalignment. This design jointly constrains visual ambiguity and textual noise, a dual-noise bottleneck that we formalize via information theory. Extensive experiments on four medical VQA benchmarks show UCAgents achieves superior accuracy (71.3% on PathVQA, +6.0% over state-of-the-art) with 87.7% lower token cost, the evaluation results further confirm that UCAgents strikes a balance between uncovering more visual evidence and avoiding confusing textual interference. These results demonstrate that UCAgents exhibits both diagnostic reliability and computational efficiency critical for real-world clinical deployment.

However, existing methods typically adopt standard decoders from language modeling, which rely on a causal attention mask. This design introduces two fundamental conflicts in 3D scene understanding: sequential bias among order-agnostic 3D objects and restricted object-instruction attention, hindering task-specific reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask (3D-SLIM), an effective masking strategy that replaces the causal mask with an adaptive attention mask tailored to the spatial structure of 3D scenes. Our 3D-SLIM introduces two key components: a Geometry-adaptive Mask that constrains attention based on spatial density rather than token order, and an Instruction-aware Mask that enables object tokens to directly access instruction context. This design allows the model to process objects based on their spatial relationships while being guided by the user's task. 3D-SLIM is simple, requires no architectural modifications, and adds no extra parameters, yet it yields substantial performance improvements across diverse 3D scene-language tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLM baselines validate its effectiveness and underscore the critical role of decoder design in 3D multi-modal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa3D-SLIM\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf93D\u573a\u666f\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u611f\u77e5\u63a9\u7801\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u56e0\u679c\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u987a\u5e8f\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u53d7\u9650\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\u5373\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u573a\u666f\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u5bf9\u65e0\u5e8f3D\u5bf9\u8c61\u5f15\u5165\u987a\u5e8f\u504f\u89c1\uff1b2\uff09\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa3D-SLIM\uff083D\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u63a9\u7801\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09\u51e0\u4f55\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bc6\u5ea6\u800c\u975e\u4ee4\u724c\u987a\u5e8f\u7ea6\u675f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff1b2\uff09\u6307\u4ee4\u611f\u77e5\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u4f7f\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ee4\u724c\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u8bbf\u95ee\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a3D\u573a\u666f\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c3D-SLIM\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57283D\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "3D-SLIM\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\u6216\u989d\u5916\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We present YingVideo-MV, the first cascaded framework for music-driven long-video generation. Our approach integrates audio semantic analysis, an interpretable shot planning module (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, and long-sequence consistency modeling to enable automatic synthesis of high-quality music performance videos from audio signals. We construct a large-scale Music-in-the-Wild Dataset by collecting web data to support the achievement of diverse, high-quality results. Observing that existing long-video generation methods lack explicit camera motion control, we introduce a camera adapter module that embeds camera poses into latent noise. To enhance continulity between clips during long-sequence inference, we further propose a time-aware dynamic window range strategy that adaptively adjust denoising ranges based on audio embedding. Comprehensive benchmark tests demonstrate that YingVideo-MV achieves outstanding performance in generating coherent and expressive music videos, and enables precise music-motion-camera synchronization.

We reveal both theoretical and practical problems associated with such deep-learning-based registration methods using GMMs, with a particular focus on the limitations of DeepGMR, a pioneering study in this line, to the partial-to-partial point set registration. Our primary goal is to uncover the causes behind such methods and propose a comprehensible solution for that. To address this, we introduce an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer, which robustly identifies a common reference point of two partial point sets, thereby acquiring transformation-invariant features. The ARPS layer employs a well-studied attention module to find a common reference point rather than the overlap region.

We present MedSeg-TTA, a comprehensive benchmark that examines twenty representative adaptation methods across seven imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, ultrasound, pathology, dermoscopy, OCT, and chest X-ray, under fully unified data preprocessing, backbone configuration, and test time protocols. The benchmark encompasses four significant adaptation paradigms: Input-level Transformation, Feature-level Alignment, Output-level Regularization, and Prior Estimation, enabling the first systematic cross-modality comparison of their reliability and applicability. The results show that no single paradigm performs best in all conditions. Input-level methods are more stable under mild appearance shifts. Feature-level and Output-level methods offer greater advantages in boundary-related metrics, whereas prior-based methods exhibit strong modality dependence. Several methods degrade significantly under large inter-center and inter-device shifts, which highlights the importance of principled method selection for clinical deployment.

To operationalize this, we introduce GeoDiT, the first diffusion-based vision-language model tailored for the geospatial domain.

However, general-purpose VLMs remain suboptimal for remote sensing (RS) tasks. Existing geospatial VLMs typically adopt a unified modeling strategy and struggle to differentiate between task types and interpretation granularities, limiting their ability to balance local detail perception and global contextual understanding. In this paper, we present SkyMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model tailored for multimodal, multi-task RS interpretation. SkyMoE employs an adaptive router that generates task- and granularity-aware routing instructions, enabling specialized large language model experts to handle diverse sub-tasks. To further promote expert decoupling and granularity sensitivity, we introduce a context-disentangled augmentation strategy that creates contrastive pairs between local and global features, guiding experts toward level-specific representation learning. We also construct MGRS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple RS interpretation tasks and granularity levels, to evaluate generalization in complex scenarios.

This dissertation aims to investigate the core challenges of zero-shot AC/AS and presents principled solutions rooted in theory and algorithmic design.\n  We first formalize the problem of consistent anomalies, a failure mode in which recurring similar anomalies systematically bias distance-based methods. By analyzing the statistical and geometric behavior of patch representations from pre-trained Vision Transformers, we identify two key phenomena - similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout - that describe how relationships among normal patches change with and without consistent anomalies in settings characterized by highly similar objects.\n  We then introduce CoDeGraph, a graph-based framework for filtering consistent anomalies built on the similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout phenomena. Through multi-stage graph construction, community detection, and structured refinement, CoDeGraph effectively suppresses the influence of consistent anomalies.\n  Next, we extend this framework to 3D medical imaging by proposing a training-free, computationally efficient volumetric tokenization strategy for MRI data. This enables a genuinely zero-shot 3D anomaly detection pipeline and shows that volumetric anomaly segmentation is achievable without any 3D training samples.\n  Finally, we bridge batch-based and text-based zero-shot methods by demonstrating that CoDeGraph-derived pseudo-masks can supervise prompt-driven vision-language models. Together, this dissertation provides theoretical understanding and practical solutions for the zero-shot AC/AS problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u8bba\u7684CoDeGraph\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u52303D\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8ddd\u79bb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f02\u5e38\uff08\u91cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5f02\u5e38\uff09\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f1a\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1. \u5206\u6790\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Vision Transformers\u4e2d\u8865\u4e01\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u90bb\u5c45\u70e7\u6bc1\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51faCoDeGraph\u56fe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u793e\u533a\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7cbe\u70bc\u6765\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f02\u5e38\uff1b3. \u6269\u5c55\u52303D\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4f53\u7d20\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff1b4. \u5c06CoDeGraph\u4f2a\u63a9\u7801\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u63d0\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "1. \u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u8ddd\u79bb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f02\u5e38\u4e0b\u7684\u5931\u6548\u673a\u5236\uff1b2.

Existing sparse-attention variants offer partial speedups, yet lack a systematic analysis of how global attention contributes to multi-view reasoning. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth investigation of the global attention modules in VGGT and $\u03c0^3$ to better understand their roles. Our analysis reveals a clear division of roles in the alternating global-frame architecture: early global layers do not form meaningful correspondences, middle layers perform cross-view alignment, and last layers provide only minor refinements. Guided by these findings, we propose a training-free two-step acceleration scheme: (1) converting early global layers into frame attention, and (2) subsampling global attention by subsampling K/V over patch tokens with diagonal preservation and a mean-fill component. We instantiate this strategy on VGGT and $\u03c0^3$ and evaluate across standard pose and point-map benchmarks.

While previous approaches have explored pedestrian generation for data augmentation, they often fail to ensure identity consistency and suffer from insufficient controllability, thereby limiting their effectiveness in dataset augmentation. To address this, We introduce OmniPerson, the first unified identity-preserving pedestrian generation pipeline for visible/infrared image/video ReID tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1) We proposed OmniPerson, a unified generation model, offering holistic and fine-grained control over all key pedestrian attributes. Supporting RGB/IR modality image/video generation with any number of reference images, two kinds of person poses, and text. Also including RGB-to-IR transfer and image super-resolution abilities.2) We designed Multi-Refer Fuser for robust identity preservation with any number of reference images as input, making OmniPerson could distill a unified identity from a set of multi-view reference images, ensuring our generated pedestrians achieve high-fidelity pedestrian generation.3) We introduce PersonSyn, the first large-scale dataset for multi-reference, controllable pedestrian generation, and present its automated curation pipeline which transforms public, ID-only ReID benchmarks into a richly annotated resource with the dense, multi-modal supervision required for this task.

A popular approach to achieve robust representations is to use web-scale scientific data. However, current biomedical vision-language pretraining typically compresses rich scientific figures and text into coarse figure-level pairs, discarding the fine-grained correspondences that clinicians actually rely on when zooming into local structures. To tackle this issue, we introduce Panel2Patch, a novel data pipeline that mines hierarchical structure from existing biomedical scientific literature, i.e., multi-panel, marker-heavy figures and their surrounding text, and converts them into multi-granular supervision. Given scientific figures and captions, Panel2Patch parses layouts, panels, and visual markers, then constructs hierarchical aligned vision-language pairs at the figure, panel, and patch levels, preserving local semantics instead of treating each figure as a single data sample. Built on this hierarchical corpus, we develop a granularity-aware pretraining strategy that unifies heterogeneous objectives from coarse didactic descriptions to fine region-focused phrases. By applying Panel2Patch to only a small set of the literature figures, we extract far more effective supervision than prior pipelines, enabling substantially better performance with less pretraining data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Panel2Patch\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u6316\u6398\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u591a\u9762\u677f\u3001\u6807\u8bb0\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u53ca\u5176\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4ece\u56fe\u8868\u5230\u9762\u677f\u518d\u5230\u5c40\u90e8\u5757\u7684\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u8868\u548c\u6587\u672c\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u7c97\u7565\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u7ea7\u914d\u5bf9\uff0c\u4e22\u5f03\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u5b9e\u9645\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u7559\u5c40\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "Panel2Patch\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\uff1a\u89e3\u6790\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u8868\u548c\u6807\u9898\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u3001\u9762\u677f\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u56fe\u8868\u7ea7\u3001\u9762\u677f\u7ea7\u548c\u5757\u7ea7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bf9\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7c92\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4ece\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u6559\u5b66\u63cf\u8ff0\u5230\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\u805a\u7126\u77ed\u8bed\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6587\u732e\u56fe\u8868\uff0cPanel2Pipeline\u5c31\u80fd\u63d0\u53d6\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Panel2Patch\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\u3002"}}

Recent approaches have leveraged motion graphs to harness the potential of existing video data. To retrieve an appropriate trajectory from the graph, previous methods either utilize the distance between features extracted from the input audio and those associated with the motions in the graph or embed both the input audio and motion into a shared feature space. However, these techniques may not be optimal due to the many-to-many mapping nature between audio and gestures, which cannot be adequately addressed by one-to-one mapping. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel framework that initially employs a diffusion model to generate gesture motions. The diffusion model implicitly learns the joint distribution of audio and motion, enabling the generation of contextually appropriate gestures from input audio sequences. Furthermore, our method extracts both low-level and high-level features from the input audio to enrich the training process of the diffusion model. Subsequently, a meticulously designed motion-based retrieval algorithm is applied to identify the most suitable path within the graph by assessing both global and local similarities in motion. Given that not all nodes in the retrieved path are sequentially continuous, the final step involves seamlessly stitching together these segments to produce a coherent video output. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating a significant improvement over prior approaches in terms of synchronization accuracy and naturalness of generated gestures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u624b\u52bf\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u8bed\u97f3\u540c\u6b65\u624b\u52bf\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u624b\u52bf\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u4e8e\u97f3\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u8ddd\u79bb\u6216\u5171\u4eab\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u97f3\u9891\u4e0e\u624b\u52bf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u591a\u5bf9\u591a\u6620\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\u3002", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u624b\u52bf\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\uff1b2) \u4ece\u8f93\u5165\u97f3\u9891\u63d0\u53d6\u4f4e\u5c42\u548c\u9ad8\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b3) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5728\u56fe\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u4f73\u8def\u5f84\uff1b4) \u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u5230\u7684\u975e\u8fde\u7eed\u8282\u70b9\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u7f1d\u62fc\u63a5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u540c\u6b65\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u624b\u52bf\u81ea\u7136\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u97f3\u9891-\u624b\u52bf\u591a\u5bf9\u591a\u6620\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u540c\u6b65\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u624b\u52bf\u89c6\u9891\u3002"}}

However, fine appearance details need to be represented as a large number of small Gaussian primitives, which can be wasteful when geometry and appearance exhibit different frequency characteristics.\n  Inspired by the long tradition of texture mapping, we propose to use texture to represent detailed appearance where possible. Our main focus is to incorporate per-primitive texture maps that adapt to the scene in a principled manner during Gaussian Splatting optimization. We do this by proposing a new appearance representation for 2D Gaussian primitives with textures where the size of a texel is bounded by the image sampling frequency and adapted to the content of the input images. We achieve this by adaptively upscaling or downscaling the texture resolution during optimization. In addition, our approach enables control of the number of primitives during optimization based on texture resolution.

To evaluate these video generation models, existing benchmarks primarily focus on factors related to visual perception and understanding, like visual aesthetics, instruction adherence, and temporal coherence. However, the rule-based reasoning capabilities of video generation models remain largely unexplored. Although recent studies have carried out preliminary explorations into whether video models can serve as zero-shot learners, they still lack a fine-grained decomposition of reasoning capabilities and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. To address this gap, we introduce RULER-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of video generation models from the perspective of cognitive rules. Built upon two fundamental paradigms: text-to-video and image-to-video, RULER-Bench covers 40 representative tasks spanning six rule categories with 622 high-quality annotated instances. For the evaluation of each generated video, we construct a checklist covering four metrics and leverage GPT-o3 to assign scores to each question, achieving 85% alignment with human judgements. Extensive experiments show that the state-of-the-art model achieves only 48.87% on the rule coherence metric, highlighting significant room for improvement in the reasoning capability of next-level video models.

To bridge this gap, we introduce PPTBench, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs on PowerPoint-related tasks. Leveraging a diverse source of 958 PPTX files, PPTBench evaluates models across four categories with 4,439 samples, including Detection, Understanding, Modification, and Generation. Our experiments reveal a substantial gap between semantic understanding and visual-layout reasoning in current MLLMs: models can interpret slide content but fail to produce coherent spatial arrangements. Ablation and further analysis show that current MLLMs struggle to combine visual cues with JSON-based layout structures and fail to integrate visual information into their API planning ability. And case studies visually expose systematic layout errors such as misalignment and element overlap. These findings provides a new perspective on evaluating VLLMs in PPT scenarios, highlighting challenges and directions for future research on visual-structural reasoning and coherent slide generation.

To address this challenge, we explore the potential of foundation models by proposing a novel pretraining strategy that leverages large-scale simulated datasets to learn robust spatial-spectral priors. Specifically, our approach first constructs diverse simulated datasets by applying various degradation operations (blur, noise, downsampling) and augmentations (bands generation, channel shuffling, high-pass filtering, color jittering, etc.) to natural images from ImageNet and remote sensing images from SkyScript. We then pretrain fusion models on these simulated data to learn generalizable spatial-spectral representations. The pretrained models are subsequently evaluated on six datasets (WorldView-2/3/4, IKONOS, QuickBird, GaoFen-2) using zero-shot and one-shot paradigms, with both full- and freeze-tuning approaches for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on different network architectures including convolutional neural networks, Transformer, and Mamba demonstrate that our pretraining strategy significantly improves generalization performance across different satellite sensors and imaging conditions for various fusion models. The pretrained models achieve superior results in zero-shot scenarios and show remarkable adaptation capability with minimal real data in one-shot settings.

This capability is especially crucial in multimedia production, where audio tracks are handled individually for each sound source for precise editing, mixing, and creative control. However, current approaches generate single source-mixed sounds at once, largely because visual features are entangled, and region cues or prompts often fail to specify the source. We propose SelVA, a novel text-conditioned V2A model that treats the text prompt as an explicit selector of target source and modulates video encoder to distinctly extract prompt-relevant video features. The proposed supplementary tokens promote cross-attention by suppressing text-irrelevant activations with efficient parameter tuning, yielding robust semantic and temporal grounding. SelVA further employs a self-augmentation scheme to overcome the lack of mono audio track supervision. We evaluate SelVA on VGG-MONOAUDIO, a curated benchmark of clean single-source videos for such a task. Extensive experiments and ablations consistently verify its effectiveness across audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization.

However, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering yet struggles with accurate reflection reconstruction from reflection-geometry entanglement, adding a deferred reflection module introduces environment map dependence. We address these limitations by proposing PolarGuide-GSDR, a polarization-forward-guided paradigm establishing a bidirectional coupling mechanism between polarization and 3DGS: first 3DGS's geometric priors are leveraged to resolve polarization ambiguity, and then the refined polarization information cues are used to guide 3DGS's normal and spherical harmonic representation.

We first identify the intra-block redundancy within the diffusion backbone and propose a progressive pruning approach that removes redundant blocks while reserving restoration capability. We note that the phase information of the restored images produced by the pruned diffusion model is not well estimated.

However, existing approaches typically process foreground and background regions indiscriminately, often resulting in background interference and suboptimal instance discovery performance on real-world data. To address this limitation, we propose Foreground-Aware Slot Attention (FASA), a two-stage framework that explicitly separates foreground from background to enable precise object discovery. In the first stage, FASA performs a coarse scene decomposition to distinguish foreground from background regions through a dual-slot competition mechanism. These slots are initialized via a clustering-based strategy, yielding well-structured representations of salient regions. In the second stage, we introduce a masked slot attention mechanism where the first slot captures the background while the remaining slots compete to represent individual foreground objects.

However, the scarcity and limited diversity of anomaly data severely constrain model generalization in open-world environments. Existing approaches mitigate this issue through synthetic data generation, either by copy-pasting external objects into driving scenes or by leveraging text-to-image diffusion models to inpaint anomalous regions. While these methods improve anomaly diversity, they often lack contextual coherence and physical realism, resulting in domain gaps between synthetic and real data. In this paper, we present ClimaDrive, a semantics-guided image-to-image framework for synthesizing semantically coherent, weather-diverse, and physically plausible OoD driving data. ClimaDrive unifies structure-guided multi-weather generation with prompt-driven anomaly inpainting, enabling the creation of visually realistic training data. Based on this framework, we construct ClimaOoD, a large-scale benchmark spanning six representative driving scenarios under both clear and adverse weather conditions. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art methods show that training with ClimaOoD leads to robust improvements in anomaly segmentation. Across all methods, AUROC, AP, and FPR95 show notable gains, with FPR95 dropping from 3.97 to 3.52 for RbA on Fishyscapes LAF.

However, the traditional satellite-centric paradigm limits robustness when high-resolution or up-to-date satellite imagery is unavailable. It further underexploits complementary cues across views (e.g., drone, satellite, and street) and modalities (e.g., language and image). To address these challenges, we propose GeoBridge, a foundation model that performs bidirectional matching across views and supports language-to-image retrieval. Going beyond traditional satellite-centric formulations, GeoBridge builds on a novel semantic-anchor mechanism that bridges multi-view features through textual descriptions for robust, flexible localization. In support of this task, we construct GeoLoc, the first large-scale, cross-modal, and multi-view aligned dataset comprising over 50,000 pairs of drone, street-view panorama, and satellite images as well as their textual descriptions, collected from 36 countries, ensuring both geographic and semantic alignment.

Many pruning methods rely solely on token importance and thus overlook inter-token redundancy, retaining numerous duplicated tokens and wasting capacity. Although some redundancy-aware approaches have been proposed, they often ignore the spatial relationships among visual tokens. This can lead to overly sparse selections of retained tokens that fail to adequately cover the regions of target objects. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-Pruner, a training-free token pruning algorithm that explicitly balances redundancy and spatial sparsity. We introduce a centrifugal token pruning paradigm that enables near-to-far selection while prioritizing the preservation of fine-grained object details. Moreover, we design a Buffering for Spatial Sparsity (BSS) criterion that defers the selection of spatially distant tokens. We further adopt a parallel greedy strategy to conduct token selection efficiently. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we selectively fuse salient information from the discarded tokens into the retained ones.

Robust and accurate inter-subject image registration of these whole-body MR images would enable their body-wide spatial standardization, and region-/voxel-wise correlation analysis of non-imaging data with image-derived parameters (e.g., tissue volume or fat content). We propose a sex-stratified inter-subject whole-body MR image registration approach that uses subcutaneous adipose tissue- and muscle-masks from the state-of-the-art VIBESegmentator method to augment intensity-based graph-cut registration. The proposed method was evaluated on a subset of 4000 subjects by comparing it to an intensity-only method as well as two previously published registration methods, uniGradICON and MIRTK. The evaluation comprised overlap measures applied to the 71 VIBESegmentator masks: 1) Dice scores, and 2) voxel-wise label error frequency. Additionally, voxel-wise correlation between age and each of fat content and tissue volume was studied to exemplify the usefulness for medical research. The proposed method exhibited a mean dice score of 0.77 / 0.75 across the cohort and the 71 masks for males/females, respectively. When compared to the intensity-only registration, the mean values were 6 percentage points (pp) higher for both sexes, and the label error frequency was decreased in most tissue regions. These differences were 9pp / 8pp against uniGradICON and 12pp / 13pp against MIRTK. Using the proposed method, the age-correlation maps were less noisy and showed higher anatomical alignment.

However, transferring such capabilities to remote sensing imagery remains challenging, as targets are often extremely small within kilometer-scale scenes, and queries typically involve intricate geospatial relations such as relative positions, spatial hierarchies, or contextual dependencies across distant objects. To address these challenges, we propose GeoViS, a Geospatially Rewarded Visual Search framework that reformulates remote sensing visual grounding as a progressive search-and-reasoning process. Rather than directly predicting the target location in a single step, GeoViS actively explores the global image through a tree-structured sequence of visual cues, integrating multimodal perception, spatial reasoning, and reward-guided exploration to refine geospatial hypotheses iteratively. This design enables the model to detect subtle small-scale targets while maintaining holistic scene awareness. Extensive experiments on five remote sensing grounding benchmarks demonstrate that GeoViS achieves precise geospatial understanding and consistently surpasses existing methods across key visual grounding metrics, highlighting its strong cross-domain generalization and interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "GeoViS\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9065\u611f\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6811\u72b6\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u5e8f\u5217\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u5168\u5c40\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u76ee\u6807\u5728\u5343\u7c73\u7ea7\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6781\u5176\u5fae\u5c0f\uff0c\u67e5\u8be2\u901a\u5e38\u6d89\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c42\u6b21\u3001\u8de8\u8ddd\u79bb\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGeoViS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9065\u611f\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6811\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u5e8f\u5217\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u5168\u5c40\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u6b65\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u9065\u611f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGeoViS\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5728\u5173\u952e\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GeoViS\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u9065\u611f\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Project page: https://tkhkaeio.github.io/projects/25-dfmamba/index.html", "summary": "Modeling daily hand interactions often struggles with severe occlusions, such as when two hands overlap, which highlights the need for robust feature learning in 3D hand pose estimation (HPE). To handle such occluded hand images, it is vital to effectively learn the relationship between local image features (e.g., for occluded joints) and global context (e.g., cues from inter-joints, inter-hands, or the scene). However, most current 3D HPE methods still rely on ResNet for feature extraction, and such CNN's inductive bias may not be optimal for 3D HPE due to its limited capability to model the global context. To address this limitation, we propose an effective and efficient framework for visual feature extraction in 3D HPE using recent state space modeling (i.e., Mamba), dubbed Deformable Mamba (DF-Mamba). DF-Mamba is designed to capture global context cues beyond standard convolution through Mamba's selective state modeling and the proposed deformable state scanning. Specifically, for local features after convolution, our deformable scanning aggregates these features within an image while selectively preserving useful cues that represent the global context. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of structured 3D HPE, with comparable inference speed to ResNet-50. Our experiments involve extensive evaluations on five divergent datasets including single-hand and two-hand scenarios, hand-only and hand-object interactions, as well as RGB and depth-based estimation. DF-Mamba outperforms the latest image backbones, including VMamba and Spatial-Mamba, on all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDF-Mamba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u72b6\u6001\u626b\u63cf\u6765\u6539\u8fdb3D\u624b\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u624b\u90e8\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e5\u5e38\u624b\u90e8\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\u5e38\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u91cd\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u53cc\u624b\u91cd\u53e0\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u73b0\u67093D\u624b\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56ResNet\uff0c\u4f46\u5176CNN\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u9002\u54083D HPE\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDeformable Mamba (DF-Mamba)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\uff08Mamba\uff09\u548c\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u72b6\u6001\u626b\u63cf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Mamba\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u5728\u5377\u79ef\u540e\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u805a\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u4ee3\u8868\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5355\u624b/\u53cc\u624b\u3001\u624b\u90e8/\u624b\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001RGB/\u6df1\u5ea6\uff09\u4e0a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cDF-Mamba\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u6700\u65b0\u56fe\u50cf\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u5305\u62ecVMamba\u548cSpatial-Mamba\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0eResNet-50\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "DF-Mamba\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u626b\u63cf\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7ed3\u6784\u53163D\u624b\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing methods often struggle to effectively fuse the complex semantic relationships between modalities and lack the ability to understand nuanced hateful content. To address these issues, we propose an innovative Reasoning-Aware Multimodal Fusion (RAMF) framework. To tackle the first challenge, we design Local-Global Context Fusion (LGCF) to capture both local salient cues and global temporal structures, and propose Semantic Cross Attention (SCA) to enable fine-grained multimodal semantic interaction. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce adversarial reasoning-a structured three-stage process where a vision-language model generates (i) objective descriptions, (ii) hate-assumed inferences, and (iii) non-hate-assumed inferences-providing complementary semantic perspectives that enrich the model's contextual understanding of nuanced hateful intent. Evaluations on two real-world hateful video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalisation performance, improving upon state-of-the-art methods by 3% and 7% in Macro-F1 and hate class recall, respectively.

Accurate detection of methane emissions is the key to taking timely action and minimizing their impact on climate change. We present AttMetNet, a novel attention-enhanced deep learning framework for methane plume detection with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The major challenge in developing a methane detection model is to accurately identify methane plumes from Sentinel-2's B11 and B12 bands while suppressing false positives caused by background variability and diverse land cover types. Traditional detection methods typically depend on the differences or ratios between these bands when comparing the scenes with and without plumes. However, these methods often require verification by a domain expert because they generate numerous false positives. Recent deep learning methods make some improvements using CNN-based architectures, but lack mechanisms to prioritize methane-specific features. AttMetNet introduces a methane-aware architecture that fuses the Normalized Difference Methane Index (NDMI) with an attention-enhanced U-Net. By jointly exploiting NDMI's plume-sensitive cues and attention-driven feature selection, AttMetNet selectively amplifies methane absorption features while suppressing background noise. This integration establishes a first-of-its-kind architecture tailored for robust methane plume detection in real satellite imagery. Additionally, we employ focal loss to address the severe class imbalance arising from both limited positive plume samples and sparse plume pixels within imagery. Furthermore, AttMetNet is trained on the real methane plume dataset, making it more robust to practical scenarios. Extensive experiments show that AttMetNet surpasses recent methods in methane plume detection with a lower false positive rate, better precision recall balance, and higher IoU.", "AI": {"tldr": "AttMetNet\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u589e\u5f3aU-Net\u548cNDMI\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eSentinel-2\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u7532\u70f7\u7fbd\u6d41\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7126\u70b9\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u89e3\u51b3\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7532\u70f7\u662f\u5f3a\u6548\u6e29\u5ba4\u6c14\u4f53\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7532\u70f7\u6392\u653e\u5bf9\u5e94\u5bf9\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6ce2\u6bb5\u5dee\u5f02\u6216\u6bd4\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u8bef\u62a5\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u7532\u70f7\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAttMetNet\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u878d\u5408\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7532\u70f7\u5dee\u5f02\u6307\u6570\uff08NDMI\uff09\u4e0e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u589e\u5f3aU-Net\u67b6\u6784\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u653e\u5927\u7532\u70f7\u5438\u6536\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u58f0\uff1b3\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u7126\u70b9\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u89e3\u51b3\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff1b4\uff09\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7532\u70f7\u7fbd\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eAttMetNet\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u66f4\u4f4e\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7387-\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u5e73\u8861\u66f4\u597d\u3001IoU\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u7532\u70f7\u7fbd\u6d41\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "AttMetNet\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408NDMI\u7684\u7fbd\u6d41\u654f\u611f\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u7532\u70f7\u7fbd\u6d41\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8bef\u62a5\u3002"}}

The surgical smoke can be classified into different types based on its motion patterns, leading to distinctive spatio-temporal characteristics across smoky laparoscopic videos. However, existing desmoking methods fail to account for such smoke-type-specific distinctions. Therefore, we propose the first Smoke-Type-Aware Laparoscopic Video Desmoking Network (STANet) by introducing two smoke types: Diffusion Smoke and Ambient Smoke. Specifically, a smoke mask segmentation sub-network is designed to jointly conduct smoke mask and smoke type predictions based on the attention-weighted mask aggregation, while a smokeless video reconstruction sub-network is proposed to perform specially desmoking on smoky features guided by two types of smoke mask. To address the entanglement challenges of two smoke types, we further embed a coarse-to-fine disentanglement module into the mask segmentation sub-network, which yields more accurate disentangled masks through the smoke-type-aware cross attention between non-entangled and entangled regions. In addition, we also construct the first large-scale synthetic video desmoking dataset with smoke type annotations.

Conditioned on text prompts, LumiX jointly generates a comprehensive set of intrinsic maps (e.g., albedo, irradiance, normal, depth, and final color), providing a structured and physically consistent description of an underlying scene. This is enabled by two key contributions: 1) Query-Broadcast Attention, a mechanism that ensures structural consistency by sharing queries across all maps in each self-attention block. 2) Tensor LoRA, a tensor-based adaptation that parameter-efficiently models cross-map relations for efficient joint training. Together, these designs enable stable joint diffusion training and unified generation of multiple intrinsic properties.

However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions.

The core of this task lies in understanding the multi-modal composed query and achieving accurate composed feature learning. Within multi-modal queries, the video modality typically carries richer semantic content compared to the textual modality. However, previous works have largely overlooked the disparity in information density between these two modalities. This limitation can lead to two critical issues: 1) modification subject referring ambiguity and 2) limited detailed semantic focus, both of which degrade the performance of CVR models. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel CVR framework, namely the Hierarchical Uncertainty-aware Disambiguation network (HUD). HUD is the first framework that leverages the disparity in information density between video and text to enhance multi-modal query understanding. It comprises three key components: (a) Holistic Pronoun Disambiguation, (b) Atomistic Uncertainty Modeling, and (c) Holistic-to-Atomistic Alignment. By exploiting overlapping semantics through holistic cross-modal interaction and fine-grained semantic alignment via atomistic-level cross-modal interaction, HUD enables effective object disambiguation and enhances the focus on detailed semantics, thereby achieving precise composed feature learning. Moreover, our proposed HUD is also applicable to the Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) task and achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets for both CVR and CIR tasks.

Adversarial training is the leading defense designed to improve model robustness. However, its effect on the transferability of attacks is underexplored. In this work, we ask whether adversarial training unintentionally increases the transferability of adversarial examples. To answer this, we trained a diverse zoo of 36 models, including CNNs and ViTs, and conducted comprehensive transferability experiments. Our results reveal a clear paradox: adversarially trained (AT) models produce perturbations that transfer more effectively than those from standard models, which introduce a new ecosystem risk. To enable reproducibility and further study, we release all models, code, and experimental scripts.

Yet existing solutions generally collapse these factors into simplified reasoning with latent embeddings, rendering the reasoning chain opaque and essentially intractable. We therefore adopt an explicit decomposition perspective and introduce ReVSeg, which executes reasoning as sequential decisions in the native interface of pretrained vision language models (VLMs). Rather than folding all reasoning into a single-step prediction, ReVSeg executes three explicit operations -- semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding -- aligning pretrained capabilities. We further employ reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain, enabling the model to self-refine its decision quality from outcome-driven signals. Experimental results demonstrate that ReVSeg attains state-of-the-art performances on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and yields interpretable reasoning trajectories.

While conventional methods rely on extracting and aggregating temporal information from videos, as humans we can often predict upcoming actions by observing a single moment from a scene, when given sufficient context. Can a model achieve this competence? The short answer is yes, although its effectiveness depends on the complexity of the task. In this work, we investigate to what extent video aggregation can be replaced with alternative modalities. To this end, based on recent advances in visual feature extraction and language-based reasoning, we introduce AAG, a method for Action Anticipation at a Glimpse. AAG combines RGB features with depth cues from a single frame for enhanced spatial reasoning, and incorporates prior action information to provide long-term context. This context is obtained either through textual summaries from Vision-Language Models, or from predictions generated by a single-frame action recognizer.

A Cross-Generator Study", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Modern image editors can produce identity-preserving AIGC (IP-AIGC), where the same person appears with new attire, background, or lighting. The robustness and fairness of current detectors in this regime remain unclear, especially for under-represented populations. We present what we believe is the first systematic study of IP-AIGC detection for Indian and South-Asian faces, quantifying cross-generator generalization and intra-population performance. We assemble Indian-focused training splits from FairFD and HAV-DF, and construct two held-out IP-AIGC test sets (HIDF-img-ip-genai and HIDF-vid-ip-genai) using commercial web-UI generators (Gemini and ChatGPT) with identity-preserving prompts. We evaluate two state-of-the-art detectors (AIDE and Effort) under pretrained (PT) and fine-tuned (FT) regimes and report AUC, AP, EER, and accuracy. Fine-tuning yields strong in-domain gains (for example, Effort AUC 0.739 to 0.944 on HAV-DF-test; AIDE EER 0.484 to 0.259), but consistently degrades performance on held-out IP-AIGC for Indian cohorts (for example, AIDE AUC 0.923 to 0.563 on HIDF-img-ip-genai; Effort 0.740 to 0.533), which indicates overfitting to training-generator cues. On non-IP HIDF images, PT performance remains high, which suggests a specific brittleness to identity-preserving edits rather than a generic distribution shift. Our study establishes IP-AIGC-Indian as a challenging and practically relevant scenario and motivates representation-preserving adaptation and India-aware benchmark curation to close generalization gaps in AIGC detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5370\u5ea6\u548c\u5357\u4e9a\u9762\u5b54\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301AIGC\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u8be5\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u7684AIGC\uff08IP-AIGC\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u4eba\u7fa4\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4eceFairFD\u548cHAV-DF\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u5370\u5ea6\u7126\u70b9\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Gemini\u548cChatGPT\u7b49\u5546\u4e1a\u751f\u6210\u5668\u521b\u5efa\u4e24\u4e2aIP-AIGC\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\uff08HIDF-img-ip-genai\u548cHIDF-vid-ip-genai\uff09\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30AIDE\u548cEffort\u4e24\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u57df\u5185\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684IP-AIGC\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002\u5728\u975eIP\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u95ee\u9898\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u7f16\u8f91\u800c\u975e\u4e00\u822c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "IP-AIGC-Indian\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4e14\u5b9e\u9645\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4fdd\u6301\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5370\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u7f29\u5c0fAIGC\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce an online RL post-training framework that optimizes a pretrained video generator for precise camera control. To make RL effective in this setting, we design a verifiable geometry reward that delivers dense segment-level feedback to guide model optimization. Specifically, we estimate the 3D camera trajectories for both generated and reference videos, divide each trajectory into short segments, and compute segment-wise relative poses.

It achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks at low cost, effectively enhancing the foundational capabilities of MLLMs and the generalization ability. Focusing on data construction, supervised fine-tuning strategies, and multimodal reinforcement learning methods, this work proposes three key innovations: (1) An information density-based data generation scheme, integrated with a dual-dimensional tree-structured label system, enabling automated generation of high-quality cross-domain data. (2) A collaborative curriculum supervised fine-tuning approach that balances the injection of domain-specific knowledge with the preservation of general capabilities. (3) A hybrid reinforcement learning paradigm that enhances reasoning ability while simultaneously addressing multi-objective optimization such as diversity exploration, maintenance of multimodal perception, and response conciseness. Moreover, we implement a series of infrastructure optimizations, such as 5D parallel training, operator optimization, and inference quantization to enhance training and inference efficiency while reducing the cost of domain adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate that the MindGPT-4ov model outperforms state-of-the-art models on benchmarks such as MMBench, MMStar, MathVision, and MathVista. In addition, MindGPT-4ov also demonstrates superior user experience in vertical domain tasks, enabling a seamless transition from academic research to industrial deployment.

Previous efforts on fewer-step distillation attempt to skip redundant steps by training compact student models, yet they often suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization. In this work, we take a different perspective: we accelerate smartly, not evenly, applying smaller speedups to early semantic stages and larger ones to later redundant phases. We instantiate this phase-aware strategy with two experts that specialize in slow and fast denoising phases. Surprisingly, instead of investing massive effort in retraining student models, we find that simply equipping the base model with lightweight LoRA adapters achieves both efficient acceleration and strong generalization. We refer to these two adapters as Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA. Through extensive experiments, our method achieves up to 5 acceleration over the base model while maintaining comparable visual quality across diverse benchmarks.

In our experiments, we find that image crops of objects with different sizes are better handled at different resolutions. Based on this observation, we propose Multi-resolution Retrieval-Detection (MRD), a training-free framework for high-resolution image understanding. To address the issue of semantic similarity bias caused by objects being split across different image crops, we propose a multi-resolution semantic fusion method, which integrates semantic similarity maps obtained at different resolutions to produce more accurate semantic information and preserve the integrity of target objects. Furthermore, to achieve direct localization of target objects at a global scale, we introduce an open-vocalbulary object detection (OVD) model that identifies object regions using a sliding-window approach.Experiments on high-resolution image understanding benchmarks using different MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMRD\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bed\u4e49\u878d\u5408\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6765\u907f\u514d\u88c1\u526a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u788e\u7247\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u88c1\u526a\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6765\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u4f46\u88c1\u526a\u4f1a\u5c06\u5b8c\u6574\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\u5230\u591a\u4e2a\u7247\u6bb5\u4e2d\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMRD\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bed\u4e49\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u56fe\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u76f4\u63a5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MRD\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u788e\u7247\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5904\u7406\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

We first analyze the factors that limit diversity in bitwise AR models and identify two key issues: (1) the binary classification nature of bitwise modeling, which restricts the prediction space, and (2) the overly sharp logits distribution, which causes sampling collapse and reduces diversity. Building on these insights, we propose DiverseAR, a principled and effective method that enhances image diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive logits distribution scaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts the sharpness of the binary output distribution during sampling, resulting in smoother predictions and greater diversity. To mitigate potential fidelity loss caused by distribution smoothing, we further develop an energy-based generation path search algorithm that avoids sampling low-confidence tokens, thereby preserving high visual quality.

Existing methods often rely on auxiliary masks or reference images for editing guidance, which limits their scalability and generalization. To address these issues, we propose LoVoRA, a novel framework for mask-free video object removal and addition using object-aware localization mechanism. Our approach utilizes a unique dataset construction pipeline that integrates image-to-video translation, optical flow-based mask propagation, and video inpainting, enabling temporally consistent edits.

However, existing video benchmarks are physical commonsense-based, offering limited insight into video models' scientific reasoning capability. We introduce VideoScience-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate undergraduate-level scientific understanding in video models. Each prompt encodes a composite scientific scenario that requires understanding and reasoning across multiple scientific concepts to generate the correct phenomenon. The benchmark comprises 200 carefully curated prompts spanning 14 topics and 103 concepts in physics and chemistry. We conduct expert-annotated evaluations across seven state-of-the-art video models in T2V and I2V settings along five dimensions: Prompt Consistency, Phenomenon Congruency, Correct Dynamism, Immutability, and Spatio-Temporal Continuity. Using a VLM-as-a-Judge to assess video generations, we observe strong correlation with human assessments. To the best of our knowledge, VideoScience-Bench is the first benchmark to evaluate video models not only as generators but also as reasoners, requiring their generations to demonstrate scientific understanding consistent with expected physical and chemical phenomena.

Since existing enhancement algorithms are often too computationally intensive for vehicular applications, we propose UltraFast-LieNET, a lightweight multi-scale shifted convolutional network for real-time low-light image enhancement. We introduce a Dynamic Shifted Convolution (DSConv) kernel with only 12 learnable parameters for efficient feature extraction. By integrating DSConv with varying shift distances, a Multi-scale Shifted Residual Block (MSRB) is constructed to significantly expand the receptive field. To mitigate lightweight network instability, a residual structure and a novel multi-level gradient-aware loss function are incorporated. UltraFast-LieNET allows flexible parameter configuration, with a minimum size of only 36 parameters. Results on the LOLI-Street dataset show a PSNR of 26.51 dB, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 4.6 dB while utilizing only 180 parameters. Experiments across four benchmark datasets validate its superior balance of real-time performance and enhancement quality under limited resources.

However, because of the fundamental disparity in geometric accuracy between these sensors, indiscriminate fusion in previous methods often leads to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose BEVDilation, a novel LiDAR-centric framework that prioritizes LiDAR information in the fusion. By formulating image BEV features as implicit guidance rather than naive concatenation, our strategy effectively alleviates the spatial misalignment caused by image depth estimation errors. Furthermore, the image guidance can effectively help the LiDAR-centric paradigm to address the sparsity and semantic limitations of point clouds. Specifically, we propose a Sparse Voxel Dilation Block that mitigates the inherent point sparsity by densifying foreground voxels through image priors. Moreover, we introduce a Semantic-Guided BEV Dilation Block to enhance the LiDAR feature diffusion processing with image semantic guidance and long-range context capture. On the challenging nuScenes benchmark, BEVDilation achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. Importantly, our LiDAR-centric strategy demonstrates greater robustness to depth noise compared to naive fusion.

To address this gap, we propose a new image-centric attack method, Contextual Image Attack (CIA), which employs a multi-agent system to subtly embeds harmful queries into seemingly benign visual contexts using four distinct visualization strategies. To further enhance the attack's efficacy, the system incorporate contextual element enhancement and automatic toxicity obfuscation techniques. Experimental results on the MMSafetyBench-tiny dataset show that CIA achieves high toxicity scores of 4.73 and 4.83 against the GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL-72B models, respectively, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) reaching 86.31\\% and 91.07\\%.

Existing solutions often rely on human intervention or underutilize the agent's ability to autonomously mitigate hallucination. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from how humans make reliable decisions in the real world. They begin with introspective reasoning to reduce uncertainty and form an initial judgment, then rely on external verification from diverse perspectives to reach a final decision. Motivated by this cognitive paradigm, we propose InEx, a training-free, multi-agent framework designed to autonomously mitigate hallucination. InEx introduces internal introspective reasoning, guided by entropy-based uncertainty estimation, to improve the reliability of the decision agent's reasoning process. The agent first generates a response, which is then iteratively verified and refined through external cross-modal multi-agent collaboration with the editing agent and self-reflection agents, further enhancing reliability and mitigating hallucination.

Existing generative frameworks, however, often treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the varying uncertainty across real-world scenes. This uniform generation leads to artifacts in complex or ambiguous regions, limiting realism and temporal stability. In this work, we present U4D, an uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling. Our approach first estimates spatial uncertainty maps from a pretrained segmentation model to localize semantically challenging regions. It then performs generation in a \"hard-to-easy\" manner through two sequential stages: (1) uncertainty-region modeling, which reconstructs high-entropy regions with fine geometric fidelity, and (2) uncertainty-conditioned completion, which synthesizes the remaining areas under learned structural priors. To further ensure temporal coherence, U4D incorporates a mixture of spatio-temporal (MoST) block that adaptively fuses spatial and temporal representations during diffusion.

However, existing datasets are often derived from limited simulators or utilize traditional Structurefrom-Motion for up-to-scale annotation and offer limited descriptive captioning, which restricts the capacity of foundation models to accurately interpret real-world dynamics from monocular videos, commonly sourced from the internet. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DynamicVerse, a physical-scale, multimodal 4D world modeling framework for dynamic real-world video. We employ large vision, geometric, and multimodal models to interpret metric-scale static geometry, real-world dynamic motion, instance-level masks, and holistic descriptive captions. By integrating window-based Bundle Adjustment with global optimization, our method converts long real-world video sequences into a comprehensive 4D multimodal format. DynamicVerse delivers a large-scale dataset consists of 100K+ videos with 800K+ annotated masks and 10M+ frames from internet videos. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark tasks, namely video depth estimation, camera pose estimation, and camera intrinsics estimation, demonstrate that our 4D modeling achieves superior performance in capturing physical-scale measurements with greater global accuracy than existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "DynamicVerse\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7269\u7406\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u76844D\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u5ea6\u91cf\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9759\u6001\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u7efc\u54084D\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u5e38\u6765\u81ea\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u6216\u4f7f\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u7684Structure-from-Motion\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6807\u6ce8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u89e3\u91ca\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u50cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u6837\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u5ea6\u91cf\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9759\u6001\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a97\u53e3\u7684Bundle Adjustment\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5c06\u957f\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5168\u9762\u76844D\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u683c\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b10\u4e07+\u89c6\u9891\u300180\u4e07+\u6807\u6ce8\u63a9\u7801\u548c1000\u4e07+\u5e27\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u5185\u53c2\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6355\u6349\u7269\u7406\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DynamicVerse\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7269\u7406\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u76844D\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u52a8\u6001\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u52a8\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We revisit this problem from a feedforward perspective and introduce \\textbf{Driving Gaussian Grounded Transformer (DGGT)}, a unified framework for pose-free dynamic scene reconstruction. We note that the existing formulations, treating camera pose as a required input, limit flexibility and scalability. Instead, we reformulate pose as an output of the model, enabling reconstruction directly from sparse, unposed images and supporting an arbitrary number of views for long sequences. Our approach jointly predicts per-frame 3D Gaussian maps and camera parameters, disentangles dynamics with a lightweight dynamic head, and preserves temporal consistency with a lifespan head that modulates visibility over time. A diffusion-based rendering refinement further reduces motion/interpolation artifacts and improves novel-view quality under sparse inputs.

While their accuracy is exceptional in flat regions, the capturing is susceptible to miss small geometric structures and may fail with dark, absorbent materials. Alternatively, capturing multiple photos of the scene and applying 3D photogrammetry can infer these details as they often represent feature-rich regions. However, the accuracy of LiDAR for featureless regions is rarely reached. Therefore, we suggest combining the strengths of LiDAR and camera-based capture by introducing SurfFill: a Gaussian surfel-based LiDAR completion scheme. We analyze LiDAR capturings and attribute LiDAR beam divergence as a main factor for artifacts, manifesting mostly at thin structures and edges. We use this insight to introduce an ambiguity heuristic for completed scans by evaluating the change in density in the point cloud. This allows us to identify points close to missed areas, which we can then use to grow additional points from to complete the scan. For this point growing, we constrain Gaussian surfel reconstruction [Huang et al. 2024] to focus optimization and densification on these ambiguous areas. Finally, Gaussian primitives of the reconstruction in ambiguous areas are extracted and sampled for points to complete the point cloud. To address the challenges of large-scale reconstruction, we extend this pipeline with a divide-and-conquer scheme for building-sized point cloud completion. We evaluate on the task of LiDAR point cloud completion of synthetic and real-world scenes and find that our method outperforms previous reconstruction methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "SurfFill\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u9762\u5143\u7684LiDAR\u70b9\u4e91\u8865\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408LiDAR\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u7cca\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u8865\u5168", "motivation": "LiDAR\u5728\u5e73\u5766\u533a\u57df\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4f46\u5bb9\u6613\u9057\u6f0f\u7ec6\u5c0f\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u6444\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u8282\u4f46\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5229\u7528LiDAR\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u5bf9\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u8865\u5168\u70b9\u4e91", "method": "1) \u5206\u6790LiDAR\u5149\u675f\u53d1\u6563\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u7cca\u533a\u57df\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b2) \u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u533a\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\u9ad8\u65af\u9762\u5143\u91cd\u5efa\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u5316\uff1b3) \u63d0\u53d6\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u5e76\u91c7\u6837\u8865\u5168\u70b9\u4e91\uff1b4) \u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cd\u5efa\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u6cbb\u7b56\u7565", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684LiDAR\u70b9\u4e91\u8865\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "SurfFill\u6210\u529f\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86LiDAR\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u9762\u5143\u91cd\u5efa\u6709\u6548\u8865\u5168\u4e86\u70b9\u4e91\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa"}}

The key difficulty lies in preserving the subject's original temporal behavior, demanding that every edited frame remains precisely synchronized with the corresponding source frame. We present Sync-LoRA, a method for editing portrait videos that achieves high-quality visual modifications while maintaining frame-accurate synchronization and identity consistency. Our approach uses an image-to-video diffusion model, where the edit is defined by modifying the first frame and then propagated to the entire sequence. To enable accurate synchronization, we train an in-context LoRA using paired videos that depict identical motion trajectories but differ in appearance. These pairs are automatically generated and curated through a synchronization-based filtering process that selects only the most temporally aligned examples for training. This training setup teaches the model to combine motion cues from the source video with the visual changes introduced in the edited first frame. Trained on a compact, highly curated set of synchronized human portraits, Sync-LoRA generalizes to unseen identities and diverse edits (e.g., modifying appearance, adding objects, or changing backgrounds), robustly handling variations in pose and expression. Our results demonstrate high visual fidelity and strong temporal coherence, achieving a robust balance between edit fidelity and precise motion preservation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Sync-LoRA\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8096\u50cf\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587LoRA\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u89c9\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5e27\u7ea7\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8096\u50cf\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u9700\u8981\u7075\u6d3b\u800c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5404\u79cd\u4fee\u6539\uff08\u5982\u5916\u89c2\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u8868\u60c5\u7f16\u8f91\u3001\u6dfb\u52a0\u5bf9\u8c61\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u65f6\u95f4\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6bcf\u4e00\u5e27\u7f16\u8f91\u90fd\u4e0e\u6e90\u5e27\u7cbe\u786e\u540c\u6b65\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u7b2c\u4e00\u5e27\u5b9a\u4e49\u7f16\u8f91\u5e76\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587LoRA\u4f7f\u7528\u6210\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\uff08\u76f8\u540c\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f46\u5916\u89c2\u4e0d\u540c\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u6b65\u8fc7\u6ee4\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7b5b\u9009\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u4eba\u7c7b\u8096\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0cSync-LoRA\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5728\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u8868\u60c5\u53d8\u5316\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u5f3a\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Sync-LoRA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7f16\u8f91\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fdd\u6301\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5f3a\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002"}}

This problem is amplified when the network inputs contain time-varying corruptions. In this work, we introduce a general approach for adapting frame-based models for stable and robust inference on video. We describe a class of stability adapters that can be inserted into virtually any architecture and a resource-efficient training process that can be performed with a frozen base network. We introduce a unified conceptual framework for describing temporal stability and corruption robustness, centered on a proposed accuracy-stability-robustness loss.

Despite recent progress, directly generating B-Reps end-to-end with precise geometry and watertight topology remains a challenge. This paper presents AutoBrep, a novel Transformer model that autoregressively generates B-Reps with high quality and validity. AutoBrep employs a unified tokenization scheme that encodes both geometric and topological characteristics of a B-Rep model as a sequence of discrete tokens. Geometric primitives (i.e., surfaces and curves) are encoded as latent geometry tokens, and their structural relationships are defined as special topological reference tokens. Sequence order in AutoBrep naturally follows a breadth first traversal of the B-Rep face adjacency graph. At inference time, neighboring faces and edges along with their topological structure are progressively generated. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our unified representation when coupled with next-token prediction for B-Rep generation. AutoBrep outperforms baselines with better quality and watertightness. It is also highly scalable to complex solids with good fidelity and inference speed. We further show that autocompleting B-Reps is natively supported through our unified tokenization, enabling user-controllable CAD generation with minimal changes.

Recent methods accelerate MRI by under-sampling $k$-space and reconstructing the resulting images using deep learning. Unrolled networks have been widely used for the reconstruction task due to their efficiency, but suffer from unstable evolving caused by freely-learnable parameters in intermediate steps. In contrast, diffusion models based on stochastic differential equations offer theoretical stability in both medical and natural image tasks but are computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce flow ODEs to MRI reconstruction by theoretically proving that unrolled networks are discrete implementations of conditional probability flow ODEs. This connection provides explicit formulations for parameters and clarifies how intermediate states should evolve. Building on this insight, we propose Flow-Aligned Training (FLAT), which derives unrolled parameters from the ODE discretization and aligns intermediate reconstructions with the ideal ODE trajectory to improve stability and convergence. Experiments on three MRI datasets show that FLAT achieves high-quality reconstructions with up to $3\\times$ fewer iterations than diffusion-based generative models and significantly greater stability than unrolled networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faFlow-Aligned Training (FLAT)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5c55\u5f00\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u6982\u7387\u6d41ODE\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u6539\u8fdbMRI\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6", "motivation": "MRI\u91c7\u96c6\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5c55\u5f00\u7f51\u7edc\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u81ea\u7531\u5b66\u4e60\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6f14\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u7406\u8bba\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5c55\u5f00\u7f51\u7edc\u662f\u6761\u4ef6\u6982\u7387\u6d41ODE\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u51faFLAT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4eceODE\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u63a8\u5bfc\u5c55\u5f00\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u4e2d\u95f4\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u7406\u60f3ODE\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bf9\u9f50", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aMRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFLAT\u76f8\u6bd4\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u51cf\u5c113\u500d\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5c55\u5f00\u7f51\u7edc\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u5c55\u5f00\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u6d41ODE\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\uff0cFLAT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86MRI\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6536\u655b\u6027"}}

Existing approaches primarily focus on non-interactive systems and are limited to producing constrained and unnatural human speech.The primary challenge of this task lies in effectively integrating understanding and generation capabilities, as well as achieving seamless multimodal audio-video fusion. To solve these problems, we propose a Conductor-Creator architecture that divides the dialogue system into two primary components.The Conductor is tasked with understanding, reasoning, and generating instructions by breaking them down into motion and speech components, thereby enabling fine-grained control over interactions. The Creator then delivers interactive responses based on these instructions.Furthermore, to address the difficulty of generating long videos with consistent identity, timbre, and tone using dual DiT structures, the Creator adopts a structure that combines autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models. The AR model is responsible for audio generation, while the diffusion model ensures high-quality video generation.Additionally, we propose a novel fusion module to enhance connections between contextually consecutive clips and modalities, enabling synchronized long-duration audio-visual content generation.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate vivid and contextually coherent long-duration dialogue interactions and accurately interpret users' multimodal queries.", "AI": {"tldr": "MAViD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Conductor-Creator\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u751f\u52a8\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u957f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u975e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53d7\u9650\u4e14\u4e0d\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u97f3\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u7f1d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u9891\u878d\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faConductor-Creator\u67b6\u6784\uff1aConductor\u8d1f\u8d23\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1bCreator\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u751f\u6210\u4ea4\u4e92\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u97f3\u9891\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u589e\u5f3a\u8fde\u7eed\u7247\u6bb5\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u751f\u52a8\u4e14\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u957f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u89e3\u91ca\u7528\u6237\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "conclusion": "MAViD\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing binaural approaches remain constrained by a two-stage pipeline that first generates mono audio and then performs spatialization, often resulting in error accumulation and spatio-temporal inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of end-to-end binaural spatial audio generation directly from silent video. To support this task, we present the BiAudio dataset, comprising approximately 97K video-binaural audio pairs spanning diverse real-world scenes and camera rotation trajectories, constructed through a semi-automated pipeline. Furthermore, we propose ViSAudio, an end-to-end framework that employs conditional flow matching with a dual-branch audio generation architecture, where two dedicated branches model the audio latent flows. Integrated with a conditional spacetime module, it balances consistency between channels while preserving distinctive spatial characteristics, ensuring precise spatio-temporal alignment between audio and the input video. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ViSAudio outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, generating high-quality binaural audio with spatial immersion that adapts effectively to viewpoint changes, sound-source motion, and diverse acoustic environments.

To tackle these challenges, we propose MultiShotMaster, a framework for highly controllable multi-shot video generation. We extend a pretrained single-shot model by integrating two novel variants of RoPE. First, we introduce Multi-Shot Narrative RoPE, which applies explicit phase shift at shot transitions, enabling flexible shot arrangement while preserving the temporal narrative order. Second, we design Spatiotemporal Position-Aware RoPE to incorporate reference tokens and grounding signals, enabling spatiotemporal-grounded reference injection. In addition, to overcome data scarcity, we establish an automated data annotation pipeline to extract multi-shot videos, captions, cross-shot grounding signals and reference images.

In contrast to image-PDF renderings or text-to-slide generation, PPTArena focuses on in-place editing across 100 decks, 2125 slides, and over 800 targeted edits covering text, charts, tables, animations, and master-level styles. Each case includes a ground-truth deck, a fully specified target outcome, and a dual VLM-as-judge pipeline that separately scores instruction following and visual quality using both structural diffs and slide images.

In our experiments, PPTPilot outperforms strong proprietary agents and frontier VLM systems by over 10 percentage points on compound, layout-sensitive, and cross-slide edits, with particularly large gains in visual fidelity and deck-wide consistency.

However, existing approaches typically train separate models for different tasks and treat image and video reasoning as disjoint domains. This results in limited scalability toward a multimodal reasoning generalist, which restricts practical versatility and hinders potential knowledge sharing across tasks and modalities. To this end, we propose OneThinker, an all-in-one reasoning model that unifies image and video understanding across diverse fundamental visual tasks, including question answering, captioning, spatial and temporal grounding, tracking, and segmentation. To achieve this, we construct the OneThinker-600k training corpus covering all these tasks and employ commercial models for CoT annotation, resulting in OneThinker-SFT-340k for SFT cold start. Furthermore, we propose EMA-GRPO to handle reward heterogeneity in multi-task RL by tracking task-wise moving averages of reward standard deviations for balanced optimization. Extensive experiments on diverse visual benchmarks show that OneThinker delivers strong performance on 31 benchmarks, across 10 fundamental visual understanding tasks. Moreover, it exhibits effective knowledge transfer between certain tasks and preliminary zero-shot generalization ability, marking a step toward a unified multimodal reasoning generalist.

In this work, we first verify that the attention maps of these models acquire geometric correspondence throughout training, attending to the geometrically corresponding regions across reference and target views for view-consistent generation. However, this correspondence signal remains incomplete, with its accuracy degrading under large viewpoint changes. Building on these findings, we introduce CAMEO, a simple yet effective training technique that directly supervises attention maps using geometric correspondence to enhance both the training efficiency and generation quality of multi-view diffusion models.

While diffusion transformers excel at holistic generation, their use of singular, monolithic prompts fails to disentangle distinct user intentions for content, position, and appearance. To overcome this, our method deconstructs creative intent into a stack of controllable visual cues: a content layer for what to create, a spatial layer for where to place it, a structural layer for how it is shaped, and a color layer for its palette. Our technical contributions include a specialized data generation pipeline for context-aware content integration, a unified control module to process all visual cues, and a fine-tuned spatial branch for precise local editing, including object removal.

However, small perturbations in the model input can significantly change the predictions. Adversarial attacks are used to identify small perturbations that can lead to misclassifications. More powerful black-box adversarial attacks are required to develop more effective defenses. A promising approach to black-box adversarial attacks is to repeat the process of extracting a specific image area and changing the perturbations added to it. Existing attacks adopt simple rectangles as the areas where perturbations are changed in a single iteration. We propose applying superpixels instead, which achieve a good balance between color variance and compactness. We also propose a new search method, versatile search, and a novel attack method, Superpixel Attack, which applies superpixels and performs versatile search. Superpixel Attack improves attack success rates by an average of 2.10% compared with existing attacks.

We then propose CoatFusion, a novel architecture that enables this task by conditioning a diffusion model on both a 2D albedo texture and granular, PBR-style parametric controls, including roughness, metalness, transmission, and a key thickness parameter.

Yet despite these achievements, modern AI systems remain fundamentally limited in their ability to self-monitor, self-correct, and regulate their behavior autonomously in dynamic contexts. This paper identifies and analyzes seven core deficiencies that constrain contemporary AI models: the absence of intrinsic self-monitoring, lack of meta-cognitive awareness, fixed and non-adaptive learning mechanisms, inability to restructure goals, lack of representational maintenance, insufficient embodied feedback, and the absence of intrinsic agency. Alongside identifying these limitations, we also outline a forward-looking perspective on how AI may evolve beyond them through architectures that mirror neurocognitive principles. We argue that these structural limitations prevent current architectures, including deep learning and transformer-based systems, from achieving robust generalization, lifelong adaptability, and real-world autonomy. Drawing on a comparative analysis of artificial systems and biological cognition [7], and integrating insights from AI research, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we outline how these capabilities are absent in current models and why scaling alone cannot resolve them. We conclude by advocating for a paradigmatic shift toward cognitively grounded AI (cognitive autonomy) capable of self-directed adaptation, dynamic representation management, and intentional, goal-oriented behavior, paired with reformative oversight mechanisms [8] that ensure autonomous systems remain interpretable, governable, and aligned with human values.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u4e03\u9879\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3b\u5f20\u5411\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u7684AI\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1AI\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9886\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u5feb\u901f\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u884c\u4e3a\u8c03\u8282\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5c40\u9650\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u963b\u788d\u4e86AI\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u7ec8\u8eab\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5206\u6790\u5f53\u4ee3AI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e03\u9879\u6838\u5fc3\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u751f\u7269\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6574\u5408AI\u7814\u7a76\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u8bba\u8bc1\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5355\u7eaf\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e03\u9879\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u610f\u8bc6\u3001\u56fa\u5b9a\u975e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u91cd\u6784\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8868\u5f81\u7ef4\u62a4\u3001\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u53cd\u9988\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u5728\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f3a\u9677\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3b\u5f20\u5411\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u7684AI\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff08\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u6211\u5bfc\u5411\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u6709\u610f\u56fe\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u914d\u5907\u6539\u9769\u6027\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6cbb\u7406\u6027\u548c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}

Prior guardrail research largely targets unimodal settings and typically frames safeguarding as binary classification, which limits robustness across diverse modalities and tasks. To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios.

However, current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle to maintain geometric coherence and cross-view consistency for spatial reasoning in multi-view settings. We attribute this gap to the lack of fine-grained benchmarks that isolate multi-view reasoning from single-view perception and temporal factors. To address this, we present ReMindView-Bench, a cognitively grounded benchmark for evaluating how VLMs construct, align and maintain spatial mental models across complementary viewpoints. ReMindView-Bench systematically varies viewpoint spatial pattern and query type to probe key factors of spatial cognition. Evaluations of 15 current VLMs reveals consistent failures in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking in multi-view spatial reasoning, motivating deeper analysis on the reasoning process. Explicit phase-wise analysis using LLM-as-a-judge and self-consistency prompting shows that VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views.

Standard imitation learning policies fail by averaging these distinct actions into a single, invalid action. In this paper, we introduce SAM2Grasp, a novel framework that resolves this issue by reformulating the task as a uni-modal, prompt-conditioned prediction problem. Our method leverages the frozen SAM2 model to use its powerful visual temporal tracking capability and introduces a lightweight, trainable action head that operates in parallel with its native segmentation head. This design allows for training only the small action head on pre-computed temporal-visual features from SAM2. During inference, an initial prompt, such as a bounding box provided by an upstream object detection model, designates the specific object to be grasped. This prompt conditions the action head to predict a unique, unambiguous grasp trajectory for that object alone. In all subsequent video frames, SAM2's built-in temporal tracking capability automatically maintains stable tracking of the selected object, enabling our model to continuously predict the grasp trajectory from the video stream without further external guidance. This temporal-prompted approach effectively eliminates ambiguity from the visuomotor policy. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that SAM2Grasp achieves state-of-the-art performance in cluttered, multi-object grasping tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "SAM2Grasp\uff1a\u5229\u7528SAM2\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u65f6\u5e8f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u6293\u53d6\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u65e0\u6b67\u4e49\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6293\u53d6\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5f53\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u76ee\u6807\u65f6\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u6f14\u793a\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5e73\u5747\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e0d\u540c\u52a8\u4f5c\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u65e0\u6548\u52a8\u4f5c", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSAM2Grasp\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5229\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684SAM2\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u53d6\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u65f6\u5e8f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5934\u4e0e\u539f\u751f\u5206\u5272\u5934\u5e76\u884c\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u4ec5\u5728\u5c0f\u52a8\u4f5c\u5934\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528SAM2\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cSAM2Grasp\u5728\u6742\u4e71\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u6293\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u7684\u6b67\u4e49\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521d\u59cb\u63d0\u793a\u6307\u5b9a\u7279\u5b9a\u6293\u53d6\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u5229\u7528SAM2\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u80fd\u529b\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u6d4b\u6293\u53d6\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u5916\u90e8\u6307\u5bfc"}}

Yet paradoxically, some of today's best generative models -- diffusion and flow-based models -- still require hundreds to thousands of neural function evaluations (NFEs) to compute a single likelihood. While recent distillation methods have successfully accelerated sampling to just a few steps, they achieve this at the cost of likelihood tractability: existing approaches either abandon likelihood computation entirely or still require expensive integration over full trajectories. We present fast flow joint distillation (F2D2), a framework that simultaneously reduces the number of NFEs required for both sampling and likelihood evaluation by two orders of magnitude. Our key insight is that in continuous normalizing flows, the coupled ODEs for sampling and likelihood are computed from a shared underlying velocity field, allowing us to jointly distill both the sampling trajectory and cumulative divergence using a single model. F2D2 is modular, compatible with existing flow-based few-step sampling models, and requires only an additional divergence prediction head. Experiments demonstrate F2D2's capability of achieving accurate log-likelihood with few-step evaluations while maintaining high sample quality, solving a long-standing computational bottleneck in flow-based generative models. As an application of our approach, we propose a lightweight self-guidance method that enables a 2-step MeanFlow model to outperform a 1024 step teacher model with only a single additional backward NFE.", "AI": {"tldr": "F2D2\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u540c\u65f6\u52a0\u901f\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u4f3c\u7136\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6240\u9700\u795e\u7ecf\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u8054\u5408\u84b8\u998f\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u7d2f\u79ef\u6563\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u597d\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u6269\u6563\u548c\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u9700\u8981\u6570\u767e\u5230\u6570\u5343\u6b21\u795e\u7ecf\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u5355\u4e2a\u4f3c\u7136\u503c\uff0c\u8fd9\u6210\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u867d\u7136\u73b0\u6709\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4f46\u8981\u4e48\u5b8c\u5168\u653e\u5f03\u4f3c\u7136\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4ecd\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5168\u8f68\u8ff9\u79ef\u5206\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5feb\u901f\u6d41\u8054\u5408\u84b8\u998f\uff08F2D2\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u8026\u5408ODE\u5171\u4eab\u5e95\u5c42\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u7684\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u8054\u5408\u84b8\u998f\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u7d2f\u79ef\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u6dfb\u52a0\u6563\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u5934\u3002", "result": "F2D2\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6b65\u9aa4\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684log-likelihood\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u97002\u6b65\u7684MeanFlow\u6a21\u578b\u5c31\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a1024\u6b65\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u989d\u5916\u4e00\u6b21\u53cd\u5411NFE\u3002", "conclusion": "F2D2\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6d41\u57fa\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u4f3c\u7136\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In the context of education, these technologies offer new opportunities to study cognitive and affective processes such as engagement, attention, and performance. However, the lack of scalable, synchronized, and high-resolution tools for multimodal data acquisition continues to be a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of Multimodal Learning Analytics in real-world educational settings. This paper presents two complementary tools developed to address these challenges: Watch-DMLT, a data acquisition application for Fitbit Sense 2 smartwatches that enables real-time, multi-user monitoring of physiological and motion signals; and ViSeDOPS, a dashboard-based visualization system for analyzing synchronized multimodal data collected during oral presentations. We report on a classroom deployment involving 65 students and up to 16 smartwatches, where data streams including heart rate, motion, gaze, video, and contextual annotations were captured and analyzed. Results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of the proposed system for supporting fine-grained, scalable, and interpretable Multimodal Learning Analytics in real learning environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u5de5\u5177\uff1aWatch-DMLT\uff08\u7528\u4e8eFitbit Sense 2\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u8868\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u5e94\u7528\uff09\u548cViSeDOPS\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eea\u8868\u677f\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u6559\u80b2\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6559\u80b2\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u5de5\u5177\uff1a1) Watch-DMLT\uff1a\u7528\u4e8eFitbit Sense 2\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u8868\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u591a\u7528\u6237\u751f\u7406\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u76d1\u6d4b\uff1b2) ViSeDOPS\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eea\u8868\u677f\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u3002\u572865\u540d\u5b66\u751f\u548c\u6700\u591a16\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u8868\u7684\u8bfe\u5802\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8bfe\u5802\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u91c7\u96c6\u4e86\u5fc3\u7387\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u6ce8\u89c6\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6ce8\u91ca\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u652f\u6301\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6559\u80b2\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Decades of psychophysics research show that humans intuitively process and integrate noisy signals using near-optimal Bayesian strategies in perceptual tasks. We ask whether LLMs exhibit similar behaviour and perform optimal multimodal integration without explicit training or instruction. Adopting the psychophysics paradigm, we infer computational principles of LLMs from systematic behavioural studies. We introduce a behavioural benchmark - BayesBench: four magnitude estimation tasks (length, location, distance, and duration) over text and image, inspired by classic psychophysics, and evaluate a diverse set of nine LLMs alongside human judgments for calibration. Through controlled ablations of noise, context, and instruction prompts, we measure performance, behaviour and efficiency in multimodal cue-combination. Beyond accuracy and efficiency metrics, we introduce a Bayesian Consistency Score that detects Bayes-consistent behavioural shifts even when accuracy saturates. Our results show that while capable models often adapt in Bayes-consistent ways, accuracy does not guarantee robustness. Notably, GPT-5 Mini achieves perfect text accuracy but fails to integrate visual cues efficiently. This reveals a critical dissociation between capability and strategy, suggesting accuracy-centric benchmarks may over-index on performance while missing brittle uncertainty handling. These findings reveal emergent principled handling of uncertainty and highlight the correlation between accuracy and Bayesian tendencies.

Additionally, existing failure datasets are mostly generated programmatically in simulation, which limits their generalization to the real world. In light of these, we introduce ViFailback, a framework designed to diagnose robotic manipulation failures and provide both textual and visual correction guidance. Our framework utilizes explicit visual symbols to enhance annotation efficiency. We further release the ViFailback dataset, a large-scale collection of 58,126 Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs along with their corresponding 5,202 real-world manipulation trajectories. Based on the dataset, we establish ViFailback-Bench, a benchmark of 11 fine-grained VQA tasks designed to assess the failure diagnosis and correction abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), featuring ViFailback-Bench Lite for closed-ended and ViFailback-Bench Hard for open-ended evaluation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we built the ViFailback-8B VLM, which not only achieves significant overall performance improvement on ViFailback-Bench but also generates visual symbols for corrective action guidance. Finally, by integrating ViFailback-8B with a VLA model, we conduct real-world robotic experiments demonstrating its ability to assist the VLA model in recovering from failures.

Previous work for predicting accident occurrences relies primarily on road network structural features while overlooking physical and environmental information from the road surface and its surroundings. In this work, we construct a large multimodal dataset across six U.S. states, containing nine million traffic accident records from official sources, and one million high-resolution satellite images for each node of the road network. Additionally, every node is annotated with features such as the region's weather statistics and road type (e.g., residential vs. motorway), and each edge is annotated with traffic volume information (i.e., Average Annual Daily Traffic). Utilizing this dataset, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal learning methods that integrate both visual and network embeddings. Our findings show that integrating both data modalities improves prediction accuracy, achieving an average AUROC of $90.1\\%$, which is a $3.7\\%$ gain over graph neural network models that only utilize graph structures. With the improved embeddings, we conduct a causal analysis based on a matching estimator to estimate the key contributing factors influencing traffic accidents. We find that accident rates rise by $24\\%$ under higher precipitation, by $22\\%$ on higher-speed roads such as motorways, and by $29\\%$ due to seasonal patterns, after adjusting for other confounding factors. Ablation studies confirm that satellite imagery features are essential for achieving accurate prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b900\u4e07\u8d77\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u6545\u8bb0\u5f55\u548c100\u4e07\u5f20\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5c06\u4e8b\u6545\u9884\u6d4b\u7684AUROC\u63d0\u5347\u81f390.1%\uff0c\u6bd4\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863.7%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u6545\u9884\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u8868\u9762\u53ca\u5176\u5468\u56f4\u73af\u5883\u7684\u7269\u7406\u548c\u73af\u5883\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u5206\u6790\u4e8b\u6545\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8986\u76d6\u7f8e\u56fd\u516d\u4e2a\u5dde\u7684\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b900\u4e07\u8d77\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u6545\u8bb0\u5f55\u3001100\u4e07\u5f20\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u8282\u70b9\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5929\u6c14\u7edf\u8ba1\u3001\u9053\u8def\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u91cf\u7b49\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6574\u5408\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u5e73\u5747AUROC 90.1%\uff0c\u6bd4\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863.7%\u3002\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u964d\u6c34\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e8b\u6545\u7387\u4e0a\u534724%\uff0c\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u7b49\u9ad8\u901f\u5ea6\u9053\u8def\u4e8b\u6545\u7387\u4e0a\u534722%\uff0c\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e8b\u6545\u7387\u4e0a\u534729%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6574\u5408\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u6545\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u4e8b\u6545\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

Adversarial imitation learning has been a highly effective method for learning motion priors from reference motion data. However, adversarial priors, with few exceptions, need to be retrained for each new controller, thereby limiting their reusability and necessitating the retention of the reference motion data when training on downstream tasks. In this work, we present Score-Matching Motion Priors (SMP), which leverages pre-trained motion diffusion models and score distillation sampling (SDS) to create reusable task-agnostic motion priors. SMPs can be pre-trained on a motion dataset, independent of any control policy or task. Once trained, SMPs can be kept frozen and reused as general-purpose reward functions to train policies to produce naturalistic behaviors for downstream tasks. We show that a general motion prior trained on large-scale datasets can be repurposed into a variety of style-specific priors. Furthermore SMP can compose different styles to synthesize new styles not present in the original dataset. Our method produces high-quality motion comparable to state-of-the-art adversarial imitation learning methods through reusable and modular motion priors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SMP across a diverse suite of control tasks with physically simulated humanoid characters.
