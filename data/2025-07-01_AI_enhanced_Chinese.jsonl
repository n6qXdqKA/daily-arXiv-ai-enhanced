However,\ntraditional feature detectors such as SIFT and SURF, which rely on\nGaussian-based scale spaces, tend to suppress high-frequency edges, making them\nunsuitable for thin crack localization. Lightweight binary alternatives like\nORB and BRISK, while computationally efficient, often suffer from poor keypoint\nrepeatability on textured or shadowed surfaces. This study presents a\nphysics-informed alignment framework that adapts the open KAZE architecture to\nSHM-specific challenges. By utilizing nonlinear anisotropic diffusion to\nconstruct a crack-preserving scale space, and integrating RANSAC-based\nhomography estimation, the framework enables accurate geometric correction\nwithout the need for training, parameter tuning, or prior calibration. The\nmethod is validated on time-lapse images of masonry and concrete acquired via\nhandheld smartphone under varied field conditions, including shadow\ninterference, cropping, oblique viewing angles, and surface clutter. Compared\nto classical detectors, the proposed framework reduces crack area and spine\nlength errors by up to 70 percent and 90 percent, respectively, while\nmaintaining sub-5 percent alignment error in key metrics. Unsupervised,\ninterpretable, and computationally lightweight, this approach supports scalable\ndeployment via UAVs and mobile platforms.

A common limitation in\nexisting vision-based automatic pest counting research is that models are\ntypically evaluated on datasets with ground truth but deployed in real-world\nscenarios without assessing the reliability of counting results due to the lack\nof ground truth. To this end, this paper proposed a method for comprehensively\nevaluating pest counting confidence in the image, based on information related\nto counting results and external environmental conditions. First, a pest\ndetection network is used for pest detection and counting, extracting counting\nresult-related information. Then, the pest images undergo image quality\nassessment, image complexity assessment, and pest distribution uniformity\nassessment. And the changes in image clarity caused by stirring during image\nacquisition are quantified by calculating the average gradient magnitude.\nNotably, we designed a hypothesis-driven multi-factor sensitivity analysis\nmethod to select the optimal image quality assessment and image complexity\nassessment methods. And we proposed an adaptive DBSCAN clustering algorithm for\npest distribution uniformity assessment. Finally, the obtained information\nrelated to counting results and external environmental conditions is input into\na regression model for prediction, resulting in the final pest counting\nconfidence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study dedicated to\ncomprehensively evaluating counting confidence in counting tasks, and\nquantifying the relationship between influencing factors and counting\nconfidence through a model.

Unlike sparse local detectors, satellite\nimagery offers consistent, city-wide road and traffic information of both\nparking and moving vehicles, overcoming data availability limitations. To\nextract information from imagery data, we design a computer vision pipeline for\nclass-specific vehicle detection and map matching, generating link-level\ntraffic density observations by vehicle class. Building upon this information,\nwe formulate a computational graph-based DODE model that calibrates dynamic\nnetwork states by jointly matching observed traffic counts and travel times\nfrom local sensors with density measurements derived from satellite imagery. To\nassess the accuracy and scalability of the proposed framework, we conduct a\nseries of numerical experiments using both synthetic and real-world data.

In this work, we propose\na method for training a masking network to perform binary object segmentation\nusing weak supervision in the form of image-wise presence or absence of an\nobject of interest, which provides less information but may be obtained more\nquickly from manual or automatic labeling. A key step in our method is that the\nsegmented objects can be placed into background-only images to create\nrealistic, images of the objects with counterfactual backgrounds. To create a\ncontrast between the original and counterfactual background images, we propose\nto first cluster the background-only images, and then during learning create\ncounterfactual images that blend objects segmented from their original source\nbackgrounds to backgrounds chosen from a targeted cluster. One term in the\ntraining loss is the divergence between these counterfactual images and the\nreal object images with backgrounds of the target cluster. The other term is a\nsupervised loss for background-only images. While an adversarial critic could\nprovide the divergence, we use sample-based divergences. We conduct experiments\non side-scan and synthetic aperture sonar in which our approach succeeds\ncompared to previous unsupervised segmentation baselines that were only tested\non natural images. Furthermore, to show generality we extend our experiments to\nnatural images, obtaining reasonable performance with our method that avoids\npretrained networks, generative networks, and adversarial critics.

Recently, with the development of Diffusion-based Dense Prediction\n(DDP) models, the exploration of DA designs tailored to this framework is worth\nexploring, since the diffusion model is effective in modeling the distribution\ntransformation that comprises domain information. In this work, we propose a\ntraining-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.\nOur motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise\nstatistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in\nconditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise\nprediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise\nAlignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics\nto domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving\ndomain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we\ndirectly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the\nnoise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the\nmore challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions\ncloser to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of\nsampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions\nprogressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling\nprocess. Notably, our method demonstrates the effectiveness of enhancing the DA\ncapability of DDP models across four common dense prediction tasks.

The review's goals are to address the lack of information that is\nsufficiently explained, learn how to make the most of virtual defect increase,\nand determine whether the framework is viable by using NDE measurements. As its\nbasic information source, the technique consists of compiling and categorizing\n223 CR photographs of airplane welds. Information expansion systems, such as\nvirtual defect increase and standard increase, are used to work on the\npreparation dataset. A modified U-net model is prepared using the improved data\nto produce semantic fault division veils. To assess the effectiveness of the\nmodel, NDE boundaries such as Case, estimating exactness, and misleading call\nrate are used. Tiny a90/95 characteristics, which provide strong\ndifferentiating evidence of flaws, reveal that the suggested approach achieves\nexceptional awareness in defect detection.

This eliminates the need to sample the space of all\npossible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual\nproblems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing\nduring inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as\nfully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating\nimage-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video\nobject, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale\neffortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the\nlength of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even\ngeneralizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire\nvideo. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector\non several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with\nstrong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources.

In this paper, we present a method to solve\nthese two problems jointly from a sequence of observed point clouds of a single\narticulated object. The main challenge in our problem setting is that the point\nclouds are not assumed to be generated by a fixed set of moving points.\nInstead, each point cloud in the sequence could be an arbitrary sampling of the\nobject surface at that particular time step. Such scenarios occur when the\nobject undergoes major occlusions, or if the dataset is collected using\nmeasurements from multiple sensors asynchronously. In these scenarios, methods\nthat rely on tracking point correspondences are not appropriate. We present an\nalternative approach based on a compact but effective representation where we\nrepresent the object as a collection of simple building blocks modeled as 3D\nGaussians. We parameterize the Gaussians with time-dependent rotations,\ntranslations, and scales that are shared across all time steps. With our\nrepresentation, part segmentation can be achieved by building correspondences\nbetween the observed points and the Gaussians. Moreover, the transformation of\neach point across time can be obtained by following the poses of the assigned\nGaussian (even when the point is not observed). Experiments show that our\nmethod outperforms existing methods that solely rely on finding point\ncorrespondences.

To\ngenerate large-scale and denser colored point clouds, we propose a deep\nlearning-based Joint Geometry and Attribute Up-sampling (JGAU) method that\nlearns to model both geometry and attribute patterns while leveraging spatial\nattribute correlations. First, we establish and release a large-scale dataset\nfor colored point cloud up-sampling called SYSU-PCUD, containing 121\nlarge-scale colored point clouds with diverse geometry and attribute\ncomplexities across six categories and four sampling rates. Second, to improve\nthe quality of up-sampled point clouds, we propose a deep learning-based JGAU\nframework that jointly up-samples geometry and attributes. It consists of a\ngeometry up-sampling network and an attribute up-sampling network, where the\nlatter leverages the up-sampled auxiliary geometry to model neighborhood\ncorrelations of the attributes. Third, we propose two coarse attribute\nup-sampling methods, Geometric Distance Weighted Attribute Interpolation\n(GDWAI) and Deep Learning-based Attribute Interpolation (DLAI), to generate\ncoarse up-sampled attributes for each point.

This separate\nencoding fails to bridge the modality gap effectively, and more critically,\nthese methods struggle with the sparsity and noise of single-frame LiDAR, often\nrequiring point cloud accumulation or additional priors to improve reliability.\nInspired by recent progress in detector-free matching paradigms (e.g.\nMatchAnything), we revisit the projection-based approach and introduce the\ndetector-free framework for direct point-pixel matching between LiDAR and\ncamera views. Specifically, we project the LiDAR intensity map into a 2D view\nfrom the LiDAR perspective and feed it into an attention-based detector-free\nmatching network, enabling cross-modal correspondence estimation without\nrelying on multi-frame accumulation. To further enhance matching reliability,\nwe introduce a repeatability scoring mechanism that acts as a soft visibility\nprior.

Utilizing latent\ncodes, our method effectively disentangles the geometry and appearance\nassociated with different facial semantics within the generated image. In\ncontrast to existing methods that can change the appearance of the entire\nradiance field, our method enables the precise editing of particular facial\nsemantics while preserving the integrity of other regions. Our network\ncomprises two key modules: the Geometry module, which generates semantic\nradiance and occupancy fields, and the Appearance module, which is responsible\nfor predicting RGB radiance. We jointly train both modules in adversarial\nsettings to learn semantic-aware geometry and appearance descriptors. The\nappearance descriptors are then conditioned on their respective semantic latent\ncodes by the Appearance Module, facilitating disentanglement and enhanced\ncontrol. Our experiments highlight SemFaceEdit's superior performance in\nsemantic field-based editing, particularly in achieving improved radiance field\ndisentanglement.", "AI": {"tldr": "SemFaceEdit\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u8f90\u5c04\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u573a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9762\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u4ed6\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u67093D\u611f\u77e5GAN\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5916\u89c2\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5916\u89c2\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSemFaceEdit\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u573a\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\u89e3\u8026\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "conclusion": "SemFaceEdit\u4e3a\u9762\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Our key\nidea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego\nagent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a\nprobability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a\nsubset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior\nprobabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative\nconsistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV)\nsegmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its\ncollaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In\naddition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to\ndynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the\nreliability of the systems in dynamic environments.

NCAs display striking emergent behaviors including\nself-regeneration, generalization and robustness to unseen situations, and\nspontaneous motion. Despite their success in texture synthesis and\nmorphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution grids. This\nlimitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow\nquadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information\nwhich impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands\nof real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this\nlimitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by\nrecent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on\na coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary\nresolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and\ntexture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with\nminimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture\nand loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and\nperformance. NCAs equipped with our implicit decoder can generate full-HD\noutputs in real time while preserving their self-organizing, emergent\nproperties. Moreover, because each MLP processes cell states independently,\ninference remains highly parallelizable and efficient. We demonstrate the\napplicability of our approach across multiple NCA variants (on 2D, 3D grids,\nand 3D meshes) and multiple tasks, including texture generation and\nmorphogenesis (growing patterns from a seed), showing that with our proposed\nframework, NCAs seamlessly scale to high-resolution outputs with minimal\ncomputational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9690\u5f0f\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7ec6\u80de\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\uff08NCA\uff09\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u9ad8\u6e05\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "NCA\u5728\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u56e0\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u5267\u589e\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u5c40\u9650\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5171\u4eab\u9690\u5f0f\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u7c97\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884cNCA\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u9ad8\u6e05\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u6d8c\u73b0\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u5e76\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u6269\u5c55\u4e86NCA\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u7f51\u683c\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In VPT, we uncover\n``burstiness'' in the values arising from the interaction of image patch\nembeddings, and the key and query projectors within Transformer's\nself-attention module. Furthermore, the values of patch embeddings and the key\nand query projectors exhibit Laplacian and hyper-Laplacian distribution,\nrespectively. Intuitively, these non-Gaussian distributions pose challenges for\nlearning prompts. To address this, we propose whitening these data,\nde-correlating them and equalizing their variance towards more Gaussian before\nlearning prompts. We derive the whitening matrix over random image patch\nembeddings and ViT's key and query projectors, and multiply it with the prompt\nto be learned in a bilinear manner.

Recently, pretrained vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) such as CLIP have been leveraged in GFSS to improve\ngeneralization on novel classes through multi-modal prototypes learning.\nHowever, existing prototype-based methods are inherently deterministic,\nlimiting the adaptability of learned prototypes to diverse samples,\nparticularly for novel classes with scarce annotations. To address this, we\npropose FewCLIP, a probabilistic prototype calibration framework over\nmulti-modal prototypes from the pretrained CLIP, thus providing more adaptive\nprototype learning for GFSS. Specifically, FewCLIP first introduces a prototype\ncalibration mechanism, which refines frozen textual prototypes with learnable\nvisual calibration prototypes, leading to a more discriminative and adaptive\nrepresentation. Furthermore, unlike deterministic prototype learning\ntechniques, FewCLIP introduces distribution regularization over these\ncalibration prototypes. This probabilistic formulation ensures structured and\nuncertainty-aware prototype learning, effectively mitigating overfitting to\nlimited novel class data while enhancing generalization. Extensive experimental\nresults on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets demonstrate that our proposed\nFewCLIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across both GFSS\nand class-incremental setting.

Existing training paradigms,\nincluding Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with\nVerifiable Reward (RLVR), impose substantial demands on the base VLM, exceeding\nthe capabilities of SVLMs. Consequently, directly applying these paradigms to\nSVLMs often suffers from severe pseudo thinking traces and advantage collapse,\nultimately undermining both thinking reliability and task performance.

Based on the\nCORE, we present a text watermarking framework named CoreMark. Specifically,\nCoreMark first dynamically extracts COREs from characters. Then, the characters\nwith stronger robustness are selected according to the lengths of COREs. By\nmodifying the thickness of the CORE, the hidden data is embedded into the\nselected characters without causing significant visual distortions.

Due to the limitations\nof current imaging techniques and the complexity of spinal structures, existing\nmethods still struggle with reducing the impact of image blurring and\ndistinguishing similar vertebrae. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a\nFrequency-enhanced Multi-granularity Context Network (FMC-Net) to improve the\naccuracy of vertebrae segmentation. Specifically, we first apply wavelet\ntransform for lossless downsampling to reduce the feature distortion in blurred\nimages. The decomposed high and low-frequency components are then processed\nseparately. For the high-frequency components, we apply a High-frequency\nFeature Refinement (HFR) to amplify the prominence of key features and filter\nout noises, restoring fine-grained details in blurred images.

The first stage, Modality-aware Continual\nPre-training, introduces a joint reconstruction objective that simultaneously\ndenoises interleaved text and image inputs, enhancing bidirectional\ncontext-aware reasoning. The second stage, Heterogeneous Contrastive\nFine-tuning, leverages diverse, semantically rich multimodal data beyond simple\nimage-caption pairs to enhance generalization and alignment. Our method\naddresses the stated limitations by introducing bidirectional attention through\ncontinual pre-training, scaling effectively with massive unlabeled datasets via\njoint reconstruction objectives, and utilizing diverse multimodal data for\nenhanced representation robustness. Experiments demonstrate that MoCa\nconsistently improves performance across MMEB and ViDoRe-v2 benchmarks,\nachieving new state-of-the-art results, and exhibits strong scalability with\nboth model size and training data on MMEB.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoCa\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "MoCa\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1\uff09\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u91cd\u5efa\u76ee\u6807\u589e\u5f3a\u53cc\u5411\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\uff1b2\uff09\u5f02\u6784\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6837\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "MoCa\u5728MMEB\u548cViDoRe-v2\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0SOTA\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MoCa\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Typically, existing methods adopt unified\nrepresentation model (e.g., Gaussian) to directly match the spatiotemporal\nfeatures of dynamic scene from frame camera. However, this unified paradigm\nfails in the potential discontinuous temporal features of objects due to frame\nimaging and the heterogeneous spatial features between background and objects.\nTo address this issue, we disentangle the spatiotemporal features into various\nlatent representations to alleviate the spatiotemporal mismatching between\nbackground and objects. In this work, we introduce event camera to compensate\nfor frame camera, and propose a spatiotemporal-disentangled Gaussian splatting\nframework for high-dynamic scene reconstruction. As for dynamic scene, we\nfigure out that background and objects have appearance discrepancy in\nframe-based spatial features and motion discrepancy in event-based temporal\nfeatures, which motivates us to distinguish the spatiotemporal features between\nbackground and objects via clustering. As for dynamic object, we discover that\nGaussian representations and event data share the consistent spatiotemporal\ncharacteristic, which could serve as a prior to guide the spatiotemporal\ndisentanglement of object Gaussians. Within Gaussian splatting framework, the\ncumulative scene-object disentanglement can improve the spatiotemporal\ndiscrimination between background and objects to render the time-continuous\ndynamic scene.

However, these approaches fail to explicitly model the\noptimal global transport path, leading to suboptimal completions. Moreover,\nperforming diffusion directly in voxel space imposes resolution constraints,\nlimiting the generation of fine-grained geometric details. To address these\nchallenges, we propose BridgeShape, a novel framework for 3D shape completion\nvia latent diffusion Schr\\\"odinger bridge. The key innovations lie in two\naspects: (i) BridgeShape formulates shape completion as an optimal transport\nproblem, explicitly modeling the transition between incomplete and complete\nshapes to ensure a globally coherent transformation.

However, the heavy\nreliance of existing systems on photometric rendering loss for camera tracking\nundermines their robustness, especially in unbounded outdoor environments with\nsevere viewpoint and illumination changes. To address these challenges, we\npropose TVG-SLAM, a robust RGB-only 3DGS SLAM system that leverages a novel\ntri-view geometry paradigm to ensure consistent tracking and high-quality\nmapping. We introduce a dense tri-view matching module that aggregates reliable\npairwise correspondences into consistent tri-view matches, forming robust\ngeometric constraints across frames. For tracking, we propose Hybrid Geometric\nConstraints, which leverage tri-view matches to construct complementary\ngeometric cues alongside photometric loss, ensuring accurate and stable pose\nestimation even under drastic viewpoint shifts and lighting variations. For\nmapping, we propose a new probabilistic initialization strategy that encodes\ngeometric uncertainty from tri-view correspondences into newly initialized\nGaussians. Additionally, we design a Dynamic Attenuation of Rendering Trust\nmechanism to mitigate tracking drift caused by mapping latency. Experiments on\nmultiple public outdoor datasets show that our TVG-SLAM outperforms prior\nRGB-only 3DGS-based SLAM systems.

However, their scalability remains a problem due to the huge\ncommunication cost among parallel processes. Most of the existing communication\nlatency analysis methods rely on the physical link layer information, which is\nonly available to administrators. In this paper, a framework called PCLVis is\nproposed to help general users analyze process communication latency (PCL)\nevents. Instead of the physical link layer information, the PCLVis uses the MPI\nprocess communication data for the analysis. First, a spatial PCL event\nlocating method is developed. All processes with high correlation are\nclassified into a single cluster by constructing a process-correlation tree.\nSecond, the propagation path of PCL events is analyzed by constructing a\ncommunication-dependency-based directed acyclic graph (DAG), which can help\nusers interactively explore a PCL event from the temporal evolution of a\nlocated PCL event cluster.

Thanks\nto the mode coverage capabilities of generative models, the likelihood-based\nparadigm is catching growing interest, as it can model normal distribution and\ndetect out-of-distribution anomalies. However, these likelihood-based methods\nare blind to the anomalies located in local modes near the learned\ndistribution. To handle these ``unseen\" anomalies, we dive into three gaps\nuniquely existing in VAD regarding scene, motion and appearance. Specifically,\nwe first build a noise-conditioned score transformer for denoising score\nmatching. Then, we introduce a scene-dependent and motion-aware score function\nby embedding the scene condition of input sequences into our model and\nassigning motion weights based on the difference between key frames of input\nsequences.

Through autoregressively injecting\nintensifying Gaussian noise into the denoised data and estimating the\ncorresponding score function, we compare the denoised data with the original\ndata to get a difference and aggregate it with the score function for an\nenhanced appearance perception and accumulate the abnormal context.

The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)\ntechniques and their variants, 4DGS, achieve high-quality renderings of dynamic\nsurgical scenes in real-time. However, 3D-GS-based methods still struggle in\nscenarios with varying illumination, such as low light and over-exposure.\nTraining 3D-GS in such extreme light conditions leads to severe optimization\nproblems and devastating rendering quality. To address these challenges, we\npresent Endo-4DGX, a novel reconstruction method with illumination-adaptive\nGaussian Splatting designed specifically for endoscopic scenes with uneven\nlighting. By incorporating illumination embeddings, our method effectively\nmodels view-dependent brightness variations. We introduce a region-aware\nenhancement module to model the sub-area lightness at the Gaussian level and a\nspatial-aware adjustment module to learn the view-consistent brightness\nadjustment. With the illumination adaptive design, Endo-4DGX achieves superior\nrendering performance under both low-light and over-exposure conditions while\nmaintaining geometric accuracy. Additionally, we employ an exposure control\nloss to restore the appearance from adverse exposure to the normal level for\nillumination-adaptive optimization.

A prevalent issue in compositional generation is the misalignment\nof spatial relationships, as models often fail to faithfully generate images\nthat reflect the spatial configurations specified between objects in the input\nprompts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel probabilistic framework\nfor modeling the relative spatial positioning of objects in a scene, leveraging\nthe concept of Probability of Superiority (PoS). Building on this insight, we\nmake two key contributions. First, we introduce a novel evaluation metric,\nPoS-based Evaluation (PSE), designed to assess the alignment of 2D and 3D\nspatial relationships between text and image, with improved adherence to human\njudgment. Second, we propose PoS-based Generation (PSG), an inference-time\nmethod that improves the alignment of 2D and 3D spatial relationships in T2I\nmodels without requiring fine-tuning. PSG employs a Part-of-Speech PoS-based\nreward function that can be utilized in two distinct ways: (1) as a\ngradient-based guidance mechanism applied to the cross-attention maps during\nthe denoising steps, or (2) as a search-based strategy that evaluates a set of\ninitial noise vectors to select the best one. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat the PSE metric exhibits stronger alignment with human judgment compared to\ntraditional center-based metrics, providing a more nuanced and reliable measure\nof complex spatial relationship accuracy in text-image alignment.

This problem is a significant safety concern since the AV may fail to\ndetect objects or misclassify them, which can potentially lead to hazardous\nsituations such as accidents. Consequently, we propose a novel object detection\napproach that shifts the emphasis from conventional class-based classification\nto object harmfulness determination.

The aim of TAMP is to restore a damaged target image\nby leveraging the complementary information from a reference image, where both\nimages captured the same scene but with a significant time gap in between,\ni.e., time-variant images. Different from conventional reference-guided image\ninpainting, the reference image under TAMP setup presents significant content\ndistinction to the target image and potentially also suffers from damages. Such\nan application frequently happens in our daily lives to restore a damaged image\nby referring to another reference image, where there is no guarantee of the\nreference image's source and quality.

To address\nsuch an ill-posed problem, we propose a novel Interactive Distribution\nTransition Estimation (InDiTE) module which interactively complements the\ntime-variant images with adaptive semantics thus facilitate the restoration of\ndamaged regions. To further boost the performance, we propose our TAMP\nsolution, namely Interactive Distribution Transition Estimation-driven\nDiffusion (InDiTE-Diff), which integrates InDiTE with SOTA diffusion model and\nconducts latent cross-reference during sampling. Moreover, considering the lack\nof benchmarks for TAMP task, we newly assembled a dataset, i.e., TAMP-Street,\nbased on existing image and mask datasets.

This\nproblem is particularly pronounced in manufacturing domains, where obtaining\nhigh-quality labels is costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces\nVision-Language Sanitization and Refinement (VLSR), which is a\nvision-language-based framework for label sanitization and refinement in\nmulti-label manufacturing image datasets. This method embeds both images and\ntheir associated textual labels into a shared semantic space leveraging the\nCLIP vision-language model. Then two key tasks are addressed in this process by\ncomputing the cosine similarity between embeddings. First, label sanitization\nis performed to identify irrelevant, misspelled, or semantically weak labels,\nand surface the most semantically aligned label for each image by comparing\nimage-label pairs using cosine similarity between image and label embeddings.\nSecond, the method applies density-based clustering on text embeddings,\nfollowed by iterative cluster merging, to group semantically similar labels\ninto unified label groups. The Factorynet dataset, which includes noisy labels\nfrom both human annotations and web-scraped sources, is employed to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed framework.

These are coupled via selective joint attention layers\nand incorporate key architectural choices, such as temporally aligned\npositional embeddings and localized joint attention masking, to enable\neffective cross-modal interaction while preserving modality-specific strengths.\nTrained with an inpainting-style objective, JAM-Flow supports a wide array of\nconditioning inputs-including text, reference audio, and reference\nmotion-facilitating tasks such as synchronized talking head generation from\ntext, audio-driven animation, and much more, within a single, coherent model.\nJAM-Flow significantly advances multi-modal generative modeling by providing a\npractical solution for holistic audio-visual synthesis. project page:\nhttps://joonghyuk.com/jamflow-web", "AI": {"tldr": "JAM-Flow\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08MM-DiT\uff09\u540c\u65f6\u5408\u6210\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u8f93\u5165\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4e8c\u8005\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u548cMM-DiT\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Motion-DiT\u548cAudio-DiT\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8054\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "JAM-Flow\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u8f93\u5165\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u6587\u672c\u3001\u53c2\u8003\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u8bf4\u8bdd\u5934\u90e8\u751f\u6210\u548c\u97f3\u9891\u9a71\u52a8\u52a8\u753b\u3002", "conclusion": "JAM-Flow\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u5408\u6210\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Second, we design a feature selection and amplification\nmechanism to imitate the sonographer's diagnostic logic for accurate MR\ngrading. Third, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts concept, we introduce a\nfeature summary module to extract the category-level features, enhancing the\nrepresentational capacity for more accurate grading. We trained and evaluated\nour proposed MReg on a large in-house A4C-CDV dataset comprising 1868 cases\nwith three graded regurgitation labels. Compared to other weakly supervised\nvideo anomaly detection and supervised classification methods, MReg\ndemonstrated superior performance in MR diagnosis.

Existing\napproaches often rely on semantic-level alignment, expecting the model to learn\nnew motion concepts and combine them with other entities (e.g., ''cats'' or\n''dogs'') to produce visually appealing results. However, video data involve\ncomplex spatio-temporal patterns, and focusing solely on semantics cause the\nmodel to overlook the visual complexity of motion. Conversely, tuning only the\nvisual representation leads to semantic confusion in representing the intended\naction. To address these limitations, we propose SynMotion, a new\nmotion-customized video generation model that jointly leverages semantic\nguidance and visual adaptation. At the semantic level, we introduce the\ndual-embedding semantic comprehension mechanism which disentangles subject and\nmotion representations, allowing the model to learn customized motion features\nwhile preserving its generative capabilities for diverse subjects. At the\nvisual level, we integrate parameter-efficient motion adapters into a\npre-trained video generation model to enhance motion fidelity and temporal\ncoherence. Furthermore, we introduce a new embedding-specific training strategy\nwhich \\textbf{alternately optimizes} subject and motion embeddings, supported\nby the manually constructed Subject Prior Video (SPV) training dataset. This\nstrategy promotes motion specificity while preserving generalization across\ndiverse subjects. Lastly, we introduce MotionBench, a newly curated benchmark\nwith diverse motion patterns.

Our\nfindings reveal that, in TTA's unsupervised online setting, each model can\nprovide complementary, confident knowledge to the others, even when there are\nsubstantial differences in model size.

In this paper, we\nintroduce Refine Any object In any ScenE (RAISE), a novel 3D enhancement\nframework that leverages 3D generative priors to recover fine-grained object\ngeometry and appearance under missing views. Starting from substituting\ndegraded objects with proxies, via a 3D generative model with strong 3D\nunderstanding, RAISE progressively refines geometry and texture by aligning\neach proxy to its degraded counterpart in 7-DOF pose, followed by correcting\nspatial and appearance inconsistencies via registration-constrained\nenhancement.

In this work,\nwe first identify a critical issue with existing conditional PT methods: using\nVII as the \"condition\" of prompts yields suboptimal performance, and even\nrandom noise-conditioned prompts can outperform the VII-conditioned\ncounterparts. On further analysis, we find that learning dynamic prompts\nconditioned on Textual Class Information (TCI) is the key to solving the BNT\nproblem. Motivated by this, we then propose Class-adaptive Prompt Tuning\n(CaPT), which enables fast adaptation of tuned models to new classes by\nlearning TCI-conditioned prompts from base classes. Remarkably, CaPT can be\nused as a plugin to mitigate the BNT problem for existing unconditional PT\nschemes. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets show that CaPT consistently\nimproves the performance of five strong unconditional PT baselines with\nnegligible additional computational cost. Additionally, by integrating CaPT\nwith our recently proposed DePT framework, we devise a new conditional PT\napproach, termed DeCaPT, which outperforms the H ACC of the state-of-the-art\nconditional PT scheme by 3.49%, averaged over the 11 datasets.

This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block\nAttention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for\nVDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within\npre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality,\nvarying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA\nenhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a\nlayer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to\ndiverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global\nblock selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions\nacross an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to\ndynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative\nsimilarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly\naccelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and\n1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation\nquality to full attention. Furthermore, VMoBA exhibits competitive performance\nin training-free inference, offering 2.40x FLOPs and 1.35x latency speedup for\nhigh-res video generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "VMoBA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08VDMs\uff09\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5757\u5206\u533a\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u5757\u9009\u62e9\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u4e86VDMs\u751f\u6210\u957f\u65f6\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "VMoBA\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5c42\u9012\u8fdb\u5757\u5206\u533a\uff081D-2D-3D\uff09\u3001\u5168\u5c40\u5757\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u9608\u503c\u5757\u9009\u62e9\u4e09\u9879\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "VMoBA\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b02.92\u500dFLOPs\u548c1.48\u500d\u5ef6\u8fdf\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d2.40\u500dFLOPs\u548c1.35\u500d\u5ef6\u8fdf\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "VMoBA\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VDMs\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u65f6\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This work\nimplements concept-based contrastive explanations for image classification by\nleveraging the similarity of instance embeddings and relevance of\nhuman-understandable concepts used by a fine-tuned deep learning model. Our\napproach extracts concepts with their relevance score, computes contrasts for\nsimilar instances, and evaluates the resulting contrastive explanations based\non explanation complexity.

This gap is critical, as user-aligned\nbehavior is essential for trust, comfort, and widespread adoption of autonomous\nvehicles. A core challenge is the lack of large-scale real-world datasets\nannotated with diverse and fine-grained driving preferences, hindering the\ndevelopment and evaluation of personalized E2EAD models. In this work, we\npresent the first large-scale real-world dataset enriched with annotations\ncapturing diverse driving preferences, establishing a foundation for\npersonalization in E2EAD. We extract static environmental features from\nreal-world road topology and infer dynamic contextual cues using a fine-tuned\nvisual language model (VLM), enabling consistent and fine-grained scenario\nconstruction. Based on these scenarios, we derive objective preference\nannotations through behavioral distribution analysis and rule-based heuristics.\nTo address the inherent subjectivity of driving style, we further employ the\nVLM to generate subjective annotations by jointly modeling scene semantics and\ndriver behavior. Final high-quality labels are obtained through a\nhuman-in-the-loop verification process that fuses both perspectives. Building\non this dataset, we propose the first benchmark for evaluating personalized\nE2EAD models. We assess several state-of-the-art models with and without\npreference conditioning, demonstrating that incorporating personalized\npreferences results in behavior more aligned with human driving.

Although WaRA was\nprimarily designed for vision tasks, we further showcase its effectiveness in\nlanguage tasks, highlighting its broader applicability and generalizability.\nThe code is publicly available at\n\\href{GitHub}{https://github.com/moeinheidari7829/WaRA}.", "AI": {"tldr": "WaRA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5206\u6790\u6539\u8fdbLoRA\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982LoRA\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u5c40\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u6216\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "WaRA\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u5c06\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u9891\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u53d8\u6362\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "WaRA\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "WaRA\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to\na surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all\ngeometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel\nGaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and\nsurface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D\nGaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the\nmesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration\ndirectly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities\noptimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical\ncontributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both\nrepresentations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying\ngeometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each\ntraining iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay\ntriangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D\nGaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric\nerosion.

Our aim is to concatenate a stack 2D free-breathing\nreal-time cines and use Deep Learning (DL) to create an isotropic a fully\nsegmented 3D cine dataset from these images. Methods: Four DL models were\ntrained on open-source data that performed: a) Interslice contrast correction;\nb) Interslice respiratory motion correction; c) Super-resolution (slice\ndirection); and d) Segmentation of right and left atria and ventricles (RA, LA,\nRV, and LV), thoracic aorta (Ao) and pulmonary arteries (PA). In 10 patients\nundergoing routine cardiovascular examination, our method was validated on\nprospectively acquired sagittal stacks of real-time cine images. Quantitative\nmetrics (ventricular volumes and vessel diameters) and image quality of the 3D\ncines were compared to conventional breath hold cine and whole heart imaging.\nResults: All real-time data were successfully transformed into 3D cines with a\ntotal post-processing time of <1 min in all cases. There were no significant\nbiases in any LV or RV metrics with reasonable limits of agreement and\ncorrelation. There is also reasonable agreement for all vessel diameters,\nalthough there was a small but significant overestimation of RPA diameter.\nConclusion: We have demonstrated the potential of creating a 3D-cine data from\nconcatenated 2D real-time cine images using a series of DL models.

While inter-institutional feature discrepancies pose a challenge in\nall federated settings, medical imaging is particularly affected due to diverse\nimaging devices and population variances, which can diminish the global model's\neffectiveness.

To address this, we propose FedCLAM, which integrates\n\\textit{client-adaptive momentum} terms derived from each client's loss\nreduction during local training, as well as a \\textit{personalized dampening\nfactor} to curb overfitting.

We find that current MLLMs perform poorly on MARBLE --\nall the 12 advanced models obtain near-random performance on M-Portal and 0%\naccuracy on M-Cube. Only in simplified subtasks some models outperform the\nrandom baseline, indicating that complex reasoning is still a challenge for\nexisting MLLMs. Moreover, we show that perception remains a bottleneck, where\nMLLMs occasionally fail to extract information from the visual inputs. By\nshedding a light on the limitations of MLLMs, we hope that MARBLE will spur the\ndevelopment of the next generation of models with the ability to reason and\nplan across many, multimodal reasoning steps.", "AI": {"tldr": "MARBLE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4ecd\u662f\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6587\u672c\u6216\u7b80\u5355\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "MARBLE\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\uff08M-Portal\u548cM-Cube\uff09\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6b65\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "12\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5728M-Portal\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u968f\u673a\uff0cM-Cube\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a0%\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "MARBLE\u63ed\u793a\u4e86MLLMs\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u3002"}}

However, existing methods primarily focus on global\nfeatures, making it challenging to capture region-specific details, which may\ncause certain abnormalities to go unnoticed. To address this, we propose\nMedRegion-CT, a region-focused Multi-Modal Large Language Model (MLLM)\nframework, featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce Region\nRepresentative ($R^2$) Token Pooling, which utilizes a 2D-wise pretrained\nvision model to efficiently extract 3D CT features. This approach generates\nglobal tokens representing overall slice features and region tokens\nhighlighting target areas, enabling the MLLM to process comprehensive\ninformation effectively. Second, a universal segmentation model generates\npseudo-masks, which are then processed by a mask encoder to extract\nregion-centric features. This allows the MLLM to focus on clinically relevant\nregions, using six predefined region masks. Third, we leverage segmentation\nresults to extract patient-specific attributions, including organ size,\ndiameter, and locations. These are converted into text prompts, enriching the\nMLLM's understanding of patient-specific contexts.

Despite significant progress in this field, current\nmulti-organ segmentation models often suffer from inaccurate details,\ndependence on geometric prompts and loss of spatial information. Addressing\nthese challenges, we introduce a novel model named CRISP-SAM2 with CRoss-modal\nInteraction and Semantic Prompting based on SAM2. This model represents a\npromising approach to multi-organ medical segmentation guided by textual\ndescriptions of organs. Our method begins by converting visual and textual\ninputs into cross-modal contextualized semantics using a progressive\ncross-attention interaction mechanism. These semantics are then injected into\nthe image encoder to enhance the detailed understanding of visual information.\nTo eliminate reliance on geometric prompts, we use a semantic prompting\nstrategy, replacing the original prompt encoder to sharpen the perception of\nchallenging targets. In addition, a similarity-sorting self-updating strategy\nfor memory and a mask-refining process is applied to further adapt to medical\nimaging and enhance localized details. Comparative experiments conducted on\nseven public datasets indicate that CRISP-SAM2 outperforms existing models.\nExtensive analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, thereby\nconfirming its superior performance, especially in addressing the limitations\nmentioned earlier.

However, existing works focus on surgical vision-language model\n(VLM), 3D reconstruction, and segmentation separately, lacking support for\nreal-time text-promptable 3D queries. In this paper, we present SurgTPGS, a\nnovel text-promptable Gaussian Splatting method to fill this gap. We introduce\na 3D semantics feature learning strategy incorporating the Segment Anything\nmodel and state-of-the-art vision-language models. We extract the segmented\nlanguage features for 3D surgical scene reconstruction, enabling a more\nin-depth understanding of the complex surgical environment. We also propose\nsemantic-aware deformation tracking to capture the seamless deformation of\nsemantic features, providing a more precise reconstruction for both texture and\nsemantic features. Furthermore, we present semantic region-aware optimization,\nwhich utilizes regional-based semantic information to supervise the training,\nparticularly promoting the reconstruction quality and semantic smoothness.

Among these, watermarking methods capable\nof preserving the generation quality are receiving increased attention.\nHowever, the proliferation and high performance of generative image editing\napplications have elevated the risks of malicious tampering, creating new\ndemands. 1) The tamper robustness of current lossless visual quality watermarks\nremains constrained by the modification-sensitive diffusion inversion process,\nnecessitating enhanced robustness. 2) The improved tampering quality and rapid\niteration cycles render passive tampering detection methods inadequate, making\nproactive tampering localization capability a desired feature for watermarks.\nTo address these requirements, this paper proposes a Tamper-Aware Generative\nimage WaterMarking method named TAG-WM. The proposed method comprises four key\nmodules: a dual-mark joint sampling (DMJS) algorithm for embedding copyright\nand localization watermarks into the latent space while preserving generative\nquality, the watermark latent reconstruction (WLR) utilizing reversed DMJS, a\ndense variation region detector (DVRD) leveraging diffusion inversion\nsensitivity to identify tampered areas via statistical deviation analysis, and\nthe tamper-aware decoding (TAD) guided by localization results.

To address these limitations, we propose the\ncross-iterative Alignment and Fusion deep Unfolding Network (AFUNet), where HDR\nreconstruction is systematically decoupled into two interleaved subtasks --\nalignment and fusion -- optimized through alternating refinement, achieving\nsynergy between the two subtasks to enhance the overall performance. Our method\nformulates multi-exposure HDR reconstruction from a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)\nestimation perspective, explicitly incorporating spatial correspondence priors\nacross LDR images and naturally bridging the alignment and fusion subproblems\nthrough joint constraints. Building on the mathematical foundation, we\nreimagine traditional iterative optimization through unfolding -- transforming\nthe conventional solution process into an end-to-end trainable AFUNet with\ncarefully designed modules that work progressively. Specifically, each\niteration of AFUNet incorporates an Alignment-Fusion Module (AFM) that\nalternates between a Spatial Alignment Module (SAM) for alignment and a Channel\nFusion Module (CFM) for adaptive feature fusion, progressively bridging\nmisaligned content and exposure discrepancies.

To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths\nand temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle\ndifferent temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal\nlengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically\nformulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may\nincur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size\nrenewal mechanism to alleviate this issue.

To circumvent\nthese costs, some parties may exploit existing models by using the generated\nimages as training data for their own models. In general, watermarking is a\nvaluable tool for detecting unauthorized use of generated images. However, when\nthese images are used to train a new model, watermarking can only enable\ndetection if the watermark persists through training and remains identifiable\nin the outputs of the newly trained model - a property known as radioactivity.\nWe analyze the radioactivity of watermarks in images generated by diffusion\nmodels (DMs) and image autoregressive models (IARs). We find that existing\nwatermarking methods for DMs fail to retain radioactivity, as watermarks are\neither erased during encoding into the latent space or lost in the\nnoising-denoising process (during the training in the latent space).

However, current TTA\nresearches generally suffer from major limitations such as duplication of\nbaseline results, limited evaluation metrics, inconsistent experimental\nsettings, and insufficient analysis. These problems hinder fair comparisons\nbetween TTA methods and obscure their practical strengths and weaknesses. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce TTA-VLM, a comprehensive benchmark for\nevaluating TTA methods on VLMs. Our benchmark implements 8 episodic TTA and 7\nonline TTA methods within a unified and reproducible framework, and evaluates\nthem across 15 widely used datasets. Unlike prior studies focused solely on\nCLIP, we extend the evaluation to SigLIP--a model trained with a Sigmoid\nloss--and include training-time tuning methods such as CoOp, MaPLe, and TeCoA\nto assess generality.

Empirical results demonstrate that\nour guidance scheduler significantly enhances image quality and alignment with\nthe text prompt, advancing the performance of text-to-image generation.\nNotably, our novel scheduler requires no additional activations or memory\nconsumption, and can seamlessly replace the common classifier-free guidance,\noffering an improved trade-off between prompt alignment and quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6307\u5bfc\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u9000\u706b\u6307\u5bfc\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u81ea\u7531\u6307\u5bfc\uff08CFG\uff09\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u53f7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6307\u5bfc\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u9000\u706b\u6307\u5bfc\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316CFG\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6216\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edfCFG\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

While recent approaches have explored representing\ntime series as text using large language models (LLMs), these methods remain\nlimited by the discrete nature of token sequences and lack the perceptual\nintuition humans typically apply, such as interpreting visual patterns. In this\npaper, we propose a multimodal contrastive learning framework that transforms\nraw time series into structured visual and textual perspectives. Rather than\nusing natural language or real-world images, we construct both modalities\ndirectly from numerical sequences. We then align these views in a shared\nsemantic space via contrastive learning, enabling the model to capture richer\nand more complementary representations. Furthermore, we introduce a variate\nselection module that leverages the aligned representations to identify the\nmost informative variables for multivariate forecasting. Extensive experiments\non fifteen short-term and six long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that\nour approach consistently outperforms strong unimodal and cross-modal\nbaselines, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal alignment in enhancing\ntime series forecasting.
