To address\nthese limitations, we propose CWNet (Causal Wavelet Network), a novel\narchitecture that leverages wavelet transforms for causal reasoning.\nSpecifically, our approach comprises two key components: 1) Inspired by the\nconcept of intervention in causality, we adopt a causal reasoning perspective\nto reveal the underlying causal relationships in low-light enhancement. From a\nglobal perspective, we employ a metric learning strategy to ensure causal\nembeddings adhere to causal principles, separating them from non-causal\nconfounding factors while focusing on the invariance of causal factors. At the\nlocal level, we introduce an instance-level CLIP semantic loss to precisely\nmaintain causal factor consistency. 2) Based on our causal analysis, we present\na wavelet transform-based backbone network that effectively optimizes the\nrecovery of frequency information, ensuring precise enhancement tailored to the\nspecific attributes of wavelet transforms.

An ethical (and evaluative) challenge facing FER\nalgorithms is that they tend to perform poorly for people of some races and\nskin colors. These challenges are linked to the data collection practices\nemployed in the creation of FER datasets. In this study, we audit two\nstate-of-the-art FER datasets.

To address this, we introduce\nThinkingViT, a nested ViT architecture that employs progressive thinking stages\nto dynamically adjust inference computation based on input difficulty.\nThinkingViT initiates inference by activating a small subset of the most\nimportant attention heads and terminates early if predictions reach sufficient\ncertainty.

However, in existing fine-tuning methods, the updated representations\nare formed as a dense combination of modified parameters, making it challenging\nto interpret their contributions and understand how the model adapts to new\ntasks. In this work, we introduce a fine-tuning framework inspired by sparse\ncoding, where fine-tuned features are represented as a sparse combination of\nbasic elements, i.e., feature dictionary atoms. The feature dictionary atoms\nfunction as fundamental building blocks of the representation, and tuning atoms\nallows for seamless adaptation to downstream tasks.

Existing methods often rely on\nfully supervised learning, which requires costly ground-truth pose annotations.\nIn this work, we propose GeoDistill, a Geometry guided weakly supervised self\ndistillation framework that uses teacher-student learning with Field-of-View\n(FoV)-based masking to enhance local feature learning for robust cross-view\nlocalization. In GeoDistill, the teacher model localizes a panoramic image,\nwhile the student model predicts locations from a limited FoV counterpart\ncreated by FoV-based masking. By aligning the student's predictions with those\nof the teacher, the student focuses on key features like lane lines and ignores\ntextureless regions, such as roads.

Furthermore, modern CNNs often integrate MLP-like blocks akin\nto those in transformers, but these blocks suffer from significant information\nredundancies, necessitating high expansion ratios to sustain competitive\nperformance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRTAN, a lightweight\narchitectural design that enhances spatial and channel-wise information\nprocessing.

A wave-based channel aggregation module further\nmodulates and reinforces pixel interactions, mitigating channel-wise\nredundancies. Combining the two modules, the proposed network can efficiently\ngather and dynamically contextualize discriminative features.

Existing methods predominantly rely on spatial-domain features\nto capture long-range dependencies, which are computationally expensive and\noften inadequate under complex haze conditions. While some approaches introduce\nfrequency-domain cues, the weak coupling between spatial and frequency branches\nlimits the overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose the\nDark Channel Guided Frequency-aware Dehazing Network (DGFDNet), a novel\ndual-domain framework that performs physically guided degradation alignment\nacross spatial and frequency domains.

Additionally, a Prior\nCorrection Guidance Branch (PCGB) incorporates a closed-loop feedback\nmechanism, enabling iterative refinement of the prior by intermediate dehazed\nfeatures and significantly improving haze localization accuracy, especially in\nchallenging outdoor scenes.

Keypoints, as\nstructure-aware, pixel-level, and compact representations of objects,\nparticularly articulated ones, play a crucial role in applications such as\nfine-grained image analysis, object retrieval, and behavior recognition. In\nthis paper, we propose KptLLM++, a novel multimodal large language model that\nspecifically designed for generic keypoint comprehension through the\nintegration of diverse input modalities guided by user-defined instructions.

Using densely acquired rotational X-ray arrays, CT can capture 3D\nspatial features. However, it is confronted with challenged such as significant\ntime consumption and high radiation exposure. CT reconstruction methods based\non sparse-view X-ray images have garnered substantial attention from\nresearchers as they present a means to mitigate costs and risks. In recent\nyears, diffusion models, particularly the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), have\ndemonstrated promising potential in the domain of 3D CT reconstruction.\nNonetheless, due to the substantial differences between the 2D latent\nrepresentation of X-ray modalities and the 3D latent representation of CT\nmodalities, the vanilla LDM is incapable of achieving effective alignment\nwithin the latent space.

To solve these problems, we proposed a comprehensive\nframework for generating forest fire smoke images. Firstly, we employed the\npre-trained segmentation model and the multimodal model to obtain smoke masks\nand image captions.Then, to address the insufficient utilization of masks and\nmasked images by inpainting models, we introduced a network architecture guided\nby mask and masked image features. We also proposed a new loss function, the\nmask random difference loss, which enhances the consistency of the generated\neffects around the mask by randomly expanding and eroding the mask\nedges.Finally, to generate a smoke image dataset using random masks for\nsubsequent detection tasks, we incorporated smoke characteristics and use a\nmultimodal large language model as a filtering tool to select diverse and\nreasonable smoke images, thereby improving the quality of the synthetic\ndataset. Experiments showed that our generated smoke images are realistic and\ndiverse, and effectively enhance the performance of forest fire smoke detection\nmodels.

This paper\npresents a novel approach called the 3D Magnetic Inverse Routine (3D MIR),\nwhich leverages Magnetic Field Images (MFI) to retrieve the parameters for the\n3D current flow of a single-segment. The 3D MIR integrates a deep learning\n(DL)-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), spatial-physics-based\nconstraints, and optimization techniques. The method operates in three stages:\ni) The CNN model processes the MFI data to predict ($\\ell/z_o$), where $\\ell$\nis the wire length and $z_o$ is the wire's vertical depth beneath the magnetic\nsensors and classify segment type ($c$). ii) By leveraging\nspatial-physics-based constraints, the routine provides initial estimates for\nthe position ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$), length ($\\ell$), current ($I$), and current\nflow direction (positive or negative) of the current segment. iii) An optimizer\nthen adjusts these five parameters ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$, $\\ell$, $I$) to\nminimize the difference between the reconstructed MFI and the actual MFI. The\nresults demonstrate that the 3D MIR method accurately recovers 3D information\nwith high precision, setting a new benchmark for magnetic image reconstruction\nin semiconductor packaging.

Unlike prior datasets,\nUGC-VideoCap emphasizes balanced integration of audio and visual modalities,\nfeaturing 1000 TikTok videos annotated through a structured three stage\nhuman-in-the-loop pipeline covering audio only, visual only, and joint audio\nvisual semantics. The benchmark also includes 4000 carefully crafted QA pairs\nprobing both unimodal and cross modal understanding. Alongside the dataset, we\npropose UGC-VideoCaptioner(3B), a 3B parameter captioning model distilled from\nGemini 2.5 Flash. Using a novel two-stage training strategy supervised fine\ntuning followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our approach\nenables efficient adaptation from limited data while maintaining competitive\nperformance. Together, our benchmark and model offer a high-quality foundation\nand a data-efficient solution for advancing omnimodal video captioning in\nunconstrained real-world UGC settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86UGC-VideoCap\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u6574\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u77ed\u683c\u5f0f\u7528\u6237\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u5b57\u5e55\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u97f3\u9891\u5728\u4f20\u8fbe\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86UGC-VideoCap\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b1000\u4e2aTikTok\u89c6\u9891\u548c4000\u4e2aQA\u5bf9\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caUGC-VideoCaptioner(3B)\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548cGRPO\uff09\u3002", "result": "UGC-VideoCap\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

First, they fail to maintain consistent background details,\nwhich limits their applicability. Furthermore, when the foreground character\nundergoes large motion variations, inconsistencies in identity and clothing\ndetails become evident. To address these problems, we propose CharaConsist,\nwhich employs point-tracking attention and adaptive token merge along with\ndecoupled control of the foreground and background. CharaConsist enables\nfine-grained consistency for both foreground and background, supporting the\ngeneration of one character in continuous shots within a fixed scene or in\ndiscrete shots across different scenes.

Tractometry is an\nadvanced tractography analysis technique for along-tract profiling to\ninvestigate the morphology and microstructural properties along the fiber\ntracts. Tractometry has become an essential tool for studying local along-tract\ndifferences between different populations (e.g., health vs disease). In this\nstudy, we propose a novel atlas-guided fine-scale tractometry method, namely\nAGFS-Tractometry, that leverages tract spatial information and permutation\ntesting to enhance the along-tract statistical analysis between populations.\nThere are two major contributions in AGFS-Tractometry. First, we create a novel\natlas-guided tract profiling template that enables consistent, fine-scale,\nalong-tract parcellation of subject-specific fiber tracts. Second, we propose a\nnovel nonparametric permutation testing group comparison method to enable\nsimultaneous analysis across all along-tract parcels while correcting for\nmultiple comparisons. We perform experimental evaluations on synthetic datasets\nwith known group differences and in vivo real data. We compare AGFS-Tractometry\nwith two state-of-the-art tractometry methods, including Automated Fiber-tract\nQuantification (AFQ) and BUndle ANalytics (BUAN). Our results show that the\nproposed AGFS-Tractometry obtains enhanced sensitivity and specificity in\ndetecting local WM differences.

Previous works in unseen\nobject instance segmentation (UOIS) train models on large-scale datasets, which\noften leads to overfitting on static visual features. This dependency results\nin poor generalization performance when confronted with out-of-distribution\nscenarios. To address this limitation, we rethink the task of UOIS based on the\nprinciple that vision is inherently interactive and occurs over time. We\npropose a novel real-time interactive perception framework, rt-RISeg, that\ncontinuously segments unseen objects by robot interactions and analysis of a\ndesigned body frame-invariant feature (BFIF). We demonstrate that the relative\nrotational and linear velocities of randomly sampled body frames, resulting\nfrom selected robot interactions, can be used to identify objects without any\nlearned segmentation model.

We observe\nthat MSE encourages blurred image re-construction, but still works for natural\nimages as it preserves dominant edges.

Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods\noften rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error,\nunder the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained\nfull-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation\nprocess introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights\nand their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally\nflawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly\nincorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error\ncompensation. FOEM approximates gradients by directly computing the difference\nbetween latent and full-precision weights, avoiding the high cost and limited\ngeneralization of backpropagation-based gradient computation.

Extensive experiments across a wide range of models\nand benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical\nGPTQ method.

In this work, we extend the application\nof DEQs to Poisson inverse problems, where the data fidelity term is more\nappropriately modeled by the Kullback-Leibler divergence. To this end, we\nintroduce a novel DEQ formulation based on Mirror Descent defined in terms of a\ntailored non-Euclidean geometry that naturally adapts with the structure of the\ndata term. This enables the learning of neural regularizers within a principled\ntraining framework. We derive sufficient conditions to guarantee the\nconvergence of the learned reconstruction scheme and propose computational\nstrategies that enable both efficient training and fully parameter-free\ninference. Numerical experiments show that our method outperforms traditional\nmodel-based approaches and it is comparable to the performance of Bregman\nPlug-and-Play methods, while mitigating their typical drawbacks - namely,\nsensitivity to initialization and careful tuning of hyperparameters.
