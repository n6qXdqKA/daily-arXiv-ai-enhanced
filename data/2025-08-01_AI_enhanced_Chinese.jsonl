A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns\nwaypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image\nand depth patches.

Synthetic\ndata methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering\nreal-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability\nto be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data\ngeneration in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and\nAnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal\nObject Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and\ncontrollable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated\nsimultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI\nenables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a\nspecified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic\nconsistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods\nthat rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning\nto ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed\nextends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on\nreference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a\ndiffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,\nmaintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically\nblending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate\nthat foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be\nreadily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next\ngeneration of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable\nand multimodal counterfactual scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5MObI\u548cAnydoorMed\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f97\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u9ad8\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "method": "MObI\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u8c61\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u652f\u63013D\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff1bAnydoorMed\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u590d\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u660e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u79cd\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided\ndiffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce\nadversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our\ndesign is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed\nhigh-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target\nsemantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added\nnoise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial\nsignal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.\nImportantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a\nlinear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying\ndefenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each\ncomponent, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to\nbe suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band.

While deep learning-based detection\nmethods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the\ninadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for\ndiverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for\nsmall-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and\ncomputational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for\nefficient, real-time detection in practical applications.

While traditional\nnumerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise\naccuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data,\nwhich is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we\npropose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation\nmetric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent\ntwo-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image\ntransformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly\nintegrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal\nLoss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series\nmodality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training.\nSATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures\nstructural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a\nfrequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast\nFourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that\nmeasures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal\nfeatures with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal\nfeature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across\nmultiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior\nperformance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline\nmethods, without additional computational cost during inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807TGSI\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570SATL\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982MSE\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTGSI\u6307\u6807\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1SATL\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u9636\u5dee\u5206\u635f\u5931\u3001\u9891\u57df\u635f\u5931\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u635f\u5931\uff09\u4ee5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528SATL\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728MSE\u548cTGSI\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "TGSI\u548cSATL\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In particular, directly generating explicit 3D\nrepresentations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant\nattention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous\napplications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on\ntransformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they\nrely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting\nin prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution\nincreases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we\nintroduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D\nGaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by\nthree core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view\nimages to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional\nmulti-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce\ncomputational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every\nlayer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely\nused datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms\nexisting methods in both reconstruction quality and speed.

To assess appropriateness for\nreal-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and\nTop-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter\ncount, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge\ndeployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and\nadjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed,\nwhile keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80%\nTop-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling\nbalance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results\ngive practical guidance for constructing resource-efficient deep learning\nmodels appropriate for real-time image processing pipelines.

The analy- sis begins with foundational\narchitectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced\nresidual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable\neffective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks.\nSubsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new\nparadigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image\npatches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale\nimage recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we\ninvestigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are\nanalyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a\ngenerator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then,\nLatent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative\nmethods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually\ncompressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater\ncomputational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image\ngeneration.

To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding\nchain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale\nemotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification.\nSimultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to\nguide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the\ndiversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce\nthe emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the\nfusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional\ngeneration guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint\ntraining allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the\nunderstanding part.

To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive\nGrouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics\nfrom paired medical images and reports.

To enable adaptive\ngrouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped\nThreshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping\nthresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages\nbased on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,\nwe introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each\nimage-text pair, removing the need for external negatives.

However,\na comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral\nand spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been\nthoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for\nunderstanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint\nspatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we\npropose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network\n(HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in\nboth spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1)\nspectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter\nencoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder\nmodule. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to\ncapture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on\ntwo HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\nadjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models. Based\non our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and\nspatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial\nresolution of the HSIs.

To conduct an in-depth performance\nanalysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed\ndataset.

Project page:\n  https://mutianxu.github.io/stable-sim2real/", "summary": "3D data simulation aims to bridge the gap between simulated and real-captured\n3D data, which is a fundamental problem for real-world 3D visual tasks. Most 3D\ndata simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to\ncapture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning\nan implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner,\nbut progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work\nexplores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called\nStable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial\nstage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and\nsynthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local\nregions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the\nsynthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where\ndiffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a\n3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data\nsimulation methods. Extensive experiments show that training the network with\nthe 3D simulated data derived from our method significantly enhances\nperformance in real-world 3D visual tasks. Moreover, the evaluation\ndemonstrates the high similarity between our 3D simulated data and\nreal-captured patterns.

The\ngoal of MIDI-B was to provide a standardized platform for benchmarking of DICOM\nimage deID tools based on a set of rules conformant to the HIPAA Safe Harbor\nregulation, the DICOM Attribute Confidentiality Profiles, and best practices in\npreservation of research-critical metadata, as defined by The Cancer Imaging\nArchive (TCIA). The challenge employed a large, diverse, multi-center, and\nmulti-modality set of real de-identified radiology images with synthetic\nPHI/PII inserted.\n  The MIDI-B Challenge consisted of three phases: training, validation, and\ntest. Eighty individuals registered for the challenge. In the training phase,\nwe encouraged participants to tune their algorithms using their in-house or\npublic data. The validation and test phases utilized the DICOM images\ncontaining synthetic identifiers (of 216 and 322 subjects, respectively). Ten\nteams successfully completed the test phase of the challenge. To measure\nsuccess of a rule-based approach to image deID, scores were computed as the\npercentage of correct actions from the total number of required actions. The\nscores ranged from 97.91% to 99.93%.

We validate our model's effectiveness on\nmulti-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple\nreal-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not\nonly notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry\nartifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian\ntrajectories.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlowGaussian-VR\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f3D\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f3D\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u5bf9VR/AR\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "FlowGaussian-VR\u5305\u62ec\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u6e32\u67d3\uff08VFR\uff09\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u6d41\u8f85\u52a9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u81f4\u5bc6\u5316\uff08FAD\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cPSNR\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc72.5 dB\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u7eb9\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u8f68\u8ff9\u66f4\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "conclusion": "FlowGaussian-VR\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Methods that use this approach combine\nthe power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven\nlearning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods\nin this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and\nstill rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for\nfunctional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the\naccuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios\nwhere assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the\nfirst time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can\nbe replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative\nmodel of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative\nmodeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit\nthe resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth\nfunctional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the\nlearned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used\nstrategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of\nfunctional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation\nstrategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain.

To handle\ncomplex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional\nGeometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete\naffordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a\nrobust geometric prior. Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design\na feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision\nFoundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art\non our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from\nsingle-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faSeqAffordSplat\u57fa\u51c6\u548cSeqSplatNet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b33D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u5355\u7269\u4f53\u5355\u6b65\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSeqSplatNet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u751f\u62103D\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u6ce8\u5165\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728SeqAffordSplat\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u529f\u80fd\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SeqSplatNet\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u529f\u80fd\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To overcome this\nproblem, we propose a novel and fast approach for topology-aware segmentation\nbased on the Euler Characteristic ($\\chi$). First, we propose a fast\nformulation for $\\chi$ computation in both 2D and 3D. The scalar $\\chi$ error\nbetween the prediction and ground-truth serves as the topological evaluation\nmetric. Then we estimate the spatial topology correctness of any segmentation\nnetwork via a so-called topological violation map, i.e., a detailed map that\nhighlights regions with $\\chi$ errors. Finally, the segmentation results from\nthe arbitrary network are refined based on the topological violation maps by a\ntopology-aware correction network. Our experiments are conducted on both 2D and\n3D datasets and show that our method can significantly improve topological\ncorrectness while preserving pixel-wise segmentation accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b27\u62c9\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u62d3\u6251\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6301\u4e45\u540c\u8c03\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u62d3\u6251\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5feb\u901f\u6b27\u62c9\u7279\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u62d3\u6251\u8fdd\u89c4\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u6821\u6b63\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57282D\u548c3D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u62d3\u6251\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This question of model selection is traditionally\nanswered by collecting and annotating a validation dataset -- a costly and\ntime-intensive process. We propose a method for active model selection, using\npredictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data\npoints that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA,\nperforms consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships\nbetween classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic\nframework. The framework uses the consensus and disagreement between models in\nthe candidate pool to guide the label acquisition process, and Bayesian\ninference to update beliefs about which model is best as more information is\ncollected. We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark\ntasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios. CODA outperforms existing\nmethods for active model selection significantly, reducing the annotation\neffort required to discover the best model by upwards of 70% compared to the\nprevious state-of-the-art.
