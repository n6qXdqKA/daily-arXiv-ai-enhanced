The framework\ncomprises two key components: an Intra-Modality Cross-Validated (IMCV) Proposal\nGenerator that utilizes cross-modality geometric consistency to generate\nhigh-quality initial 3D proposals, and an Annotated-Class Assisted (ACA)\nDenoiser that progressively refines 3D proposals by leveraging geometric priors\nfrom annotated categories through a DDIM-based denoising mechanism.Compared to\nthe state-of-the-art method, training with pseudo-labels generated by our\napproach achieves a 7.37% improvement in mAP on novel classes, demonstrating\nthe superior quality of the pseudo-labels produced by our framework. HQ-OV3D\ncan serve not only as a strong standalone open-vocabulary 3D detector but also\nas a plug-in high-quality pseudo-label generator for existing open-vocabulary\ndetection or annotation pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHQ-OV3D\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c473D\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5c01\u95ed\u96c63D\u68c0\u6d4b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u51e0\u4f55\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684IMCV\u63d0\u6848\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eDDIM\u7684ACA\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u578b\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0amAP\u63d0\u53477.37%\u3002", "conclusion": "HQ-OV3D\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u6216\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3002"}}

While early research focused on unconditional sampling,\npractitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise\nspecification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants\nprecise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases\nlatency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and\ndenoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce\nEVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead\nwithout retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual\ncaching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we\nfirst profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained\ncontrol, then partition the network into global and local functional zones.

This potential has\nbeen partly driven by the success of general-purpose vision models such as the\nSegment Anything Model (SAM), which has inspired the development of various\nfine-tuned variants for medical segmentation tasks. However, fine-tuned\nvariants like MedSAM are trained on comparatively limited medical imaging data\nthat often suffers from heterogeneity, scarce annotations, and distributional\nshifts. These challenges limit their ability to generalize across a wide range\nof medical segmentation tasks.

This creates an opportunity to empirically define\nbody composition signatures linked to type 2 diabetes risk and protection using\nlarge-scale clinical data. Approach: To uncover BMI-specific diabetic abdominal\npatterns from clinical CT, we applied our design four times: once on the full\ncohort (n = 1,728) and once on lean (n = 497), overweight (n = 611), and obese\n(n = 620) subgroups separately. Briefly, our experimental design transforms\nabdominal scans into collections of explainable measurements through\nsegmentation, classifies type 2 diabetes through a cross-validated random\nforest, measures how features contribute to model-estimated risk or protection\nthrough SHAP analysis, groups scans by shared model decision patterns\n(clustering from SHAP) and links back to anatomical differences\n(classification). Results: The random-forests achieved mean AUCs of 0.72-0.74.\nThere were shared type 2 diabetes signatures in each group; fatty skeletal\nmuscle, older age, greater visceral and subcutaneous fat, and a smaller or\nfat-laden pancreas.

Secondly, the RBDM perturbs the hazy and haze-free images at\nindividual timesteps and predicts the noise in the perturbed data to\nsimultaneously learn the conditional distributions. Finally, to enhance\nperformance on relatively small datasets and reduce computational costs, our\nmethod introduces a unified score function learned on image patches instead of\nentire images. Our RBDM successfully implements size-agnostic bidirectional\ntransitions between haze-free and hazy images with only 15 sampling steps.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior or\nat least comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic\nand real-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b8b\u5dee\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u53cc\u5411\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08RBDM\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u53bb\u96fe\u548c\u96fe\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u53bb\u96fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u53bb\u96fe\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u96fe\u4e0e\u65e0\u96fe\u56fe\u50cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u8f6c\u6362\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u53cc\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u4ee5\u5e73\u6ed1\u8f6c\u6362\u6b8b\u5dee\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6270\u52a8\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\u5b66\u4e60\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "RBDM\u4ec5\u970015\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u56fe\u50cf\u5c3a\u5bf8\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u5ab2\u7f8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "RBDM\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u53cc\u5411\u8f6c\u6362\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

However, existing methods struggle to align with\nfine-grained human preferences across multiple dimensions, such as motion\nnaturalness, lip-sync accuracy, and visual quality. This is due to the\ndifficulty of optimizing among competing preference objectives, which often\nconflict with one another, and the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality\ndatasets with multidimensional preference annotations. To address these, we\nfirst introduce Talking-Critic, a multimodal reward model that learns\nhuman-aligned reward functions to quantify how well generated videos satisfy\nmultidimensional expectations. Leveraging this model, we curate Talking-NSQ, a\nlarge-scale multidimensional human preference dataset containing 410K\npreference pairs. Finally, we propose Timestep-Layer adaptive multi-expert\nPreference Optimization (TLPO), a novel framework for aligning diffusion-based\nportrait animation models with fine-grained, multidimensional preferences. TLPO\ndecouples preferences into specialized expert modules, which are then fused\nacross timesteps and network layers, enabling comprehensive, fine-grained\nenhancement across all dimensions without mutual interference.

To ensure accurate registration of\nthe synthesised pseudo-RGBD frames from MAPIS-Depth, a novel WEMA-RTDL module\nis integrated, optimising both rotation and translation.

However, their capacity for logical\nunderstanding remains significantly underexplored, resulting in critical\n''logical blindspots'' that limit their reliability in practical applications.\nTo systematically diagnose this, we introduce LogicBench, a comprehensive\nbenchmark with over 50,000 vision-language pairs across 9 logical categories\nand 4 diverse scenarios: images, videos, anomaly detection, and medical\ndiagnostics. Our evaluation reveals that existing VLMs, even the\nstate-of-the-art ones, fall at over 40 accuracy points below human performance,\nparticularly in challenging tasks like Causality and Conditionality,\nhighlighting their reliance on surface semantics over critical logical\nstructures.

LogicCLIP utilizes\nlogic-aware data generation and a contrastive learning strategy that combines\ncoarse-grained alignment, a fine-grained multiple-choice objective, and a novel\nlogical structure-aware objective.

To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful\ngenerative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable\nimage classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by\nrandomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising\neffects with different category conditions to classify categories.\nUnfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise\ninstability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance\nchanges. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always\nensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces\nthe classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in\nDC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the\ninstability. Meanwhile, we argue that these good noises should meet two\nprinciples: Frequency Matching and Spatial Matching. Regarding both principles,\nwe propose a novel Noise Optimization method to learn matching (i.e., good)\nnoise for DCs: NoOp. For frequency matching, NoOp first optimizes a\ndataset-specific noise: Given a dataset and a timestep t, optimize one randomly\ninitialized parameterized noise. For Spatial Matching, NoOp trains a\nMeta-Network that adopts an image as input and outputs image-specific noise\noffset.

While supervised deep\nlearning approaches achieve high segmentation accuracy, their reliance on\nextensive pixel-level annotation renders them impractical for clinical\nworkflows. Few-shot learning can reduce this annotation burden but often\nstruggles to capture the fine structural details necessary for GBM analysis. In\nthis study, we introduce CoFi, a fast and efficient coarse-to-fine few-shot\nsegmentation pipeline designed for GBM delineation in EM images. CoFi first\ntrains a lightweight neural network using only three annotated images to\nproduce an initial coarse segmentation mask. This mask is then automatically\nprocessed to generate high-quality point prompts with morphology-aware pruning,\nwhich are subsequently used to guide SAM in refining the segmentation. The\nproposed method achieved exceptional GBM segmentation performance, with a Dice\ncoefficient of 74.54% and an inference speed of 1.9 FPS. We demonstrate that\nCoFi not only alleviates the annotation and computational burdens associated\nwith conventional methods, but also achieves accurate and reliable segmentation\nresults.

A growing body of works have\nemerged to address insufficient anomaly data via anomaly generation. However,\nthese anomaly generation methods suffer from lack of fidelity or need to be\ntrained with extra data. To this end, we propose a training-free anomaly\ngeneration framework dubbed AAG, which is based on Stable Diffusion (SD)'s\nstrong generation ability for effective anomaly image generation. Given a\nnormal image, mask and a simple text prompt, AAG can generate realistic and\nnatural anomalies in the specific regions and simultaneously keep contents in\nother regions unchanged. In particular, we propose Cross-Attention Enhancement\n(CAE) to re-engineer the cross-attention mechanism within Stable Diffusion\nbased on the given mask. CAE increases the similarity between visual tokens in\nspecific regions and text embeddings, which guides these generated visual\ntokens in accordance with the text description. Besides, generated anomalies\nneed to be more natural and plausible with object in given image.

Despite the growing interest and efforts in this\nfield, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2)\nlack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement for\nsufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, a\ntrajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies.\nTrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation\nNetwork (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data\npreprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports\nbroadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to\nlearn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet\nlearns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual\nfeatures with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive\nloss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an\nunsupervised manner. The experiments are conducted on three broadcast video\ndatasets to verify the effectiveness of TrajSV for three types of sports (i.e.,\nsoccer, basketball, and volleyball) with three downstream applications (i.e.,\nsports video retrieval, action spotting, and video captioning). The results\ndemonstrate that TrajSV achieves state-of-the-art performance in sports video\nretrieval, showcasing a nearly 70% improvement. It outperforms baselines in\naction spotting, achieving state-of-the-art results in 9 out of 17 action\ncategories, and demonstrates a nearly 20% improvement in video captioning.\nAdditionally, we introduce a deployed system along with the three applications\nbased on TrajSV.", "AI": {"tldr": "TrajSV\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f53\u80b2\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u8f68\u8ff9\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4f53\u80b2\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f53\u80b2\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u8f68\u8ff9\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "TrajSV\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001Clip Representation Network (CRNet)\u548cVideo Representation Network (VRNet)\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f68\u8ff9\u589e\u5f3a\u7684Transformer\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u4e09\u91cd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f53\u80b2\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5b57\u5e55\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8fd170%\uff0c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u572817\u7c7b\u4e2d9\u7c7b\u9886\u5148\uff0c\u5b57\u5e55\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8fd120%\u3002", "conclusion": "TrajSV\u5728\u4f53\u80b2\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u7f72\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

In contrast, reversing the frame sequence while\npreserving the original PEs causes a substantial drop. To explain this\nbehavior, we conduct substantial analysis experiments to trace how temporal\ninformation is integrated within the model.

This emergent mechanism shows that temporal reasoning emerges\nfrom inter-visual token interactions under the constraints of causal attention,\nwhich implicitly encodes temporal structure. Based on these insights, we\npropose two efficiency-oriented strategies: staged cross-modal attention and a\ntemporal exit mechanism for early token truncation.

However, existing approaches struggle\nto effectively compose multiple LoRA adapters, particularly in open-ended\nsettings where the number and nature of required skills are not known in\nadvance. In this work, we present LoRAtorio, a novel train-free framework for\nmulti-LoRA composition that leverages intrinsic model behaviour. Our method is\nmotivated by two key observations: (1) LoRA adapters trained on narrow domains\nproduce denoised outputs that diverge from the base model, and (2) when\noperating out-of-distribution, LoRA outputs show behaviour closer to the base\nmodel than when conditioned in distribution. The balance between these two\nobservations allows for exceptional performance in the single LoRA scenario,\nwhich nevertheless deteriorates when multiple LoRAs are loaded. Our method\noperates in the latent space by dividing it into spatial patches and computing\ncosine similarity between each patch's predicted noise and that of the base\nmodel. These similarities are used to construct a spatially-aware weight\nmatrix, which guides a weighted aggregation of LoRA outputs. To address domain\ndrift, we further propose a modification to classifier-free guidance that\nincorporates the base model's unconditional score into the composition. We\nextend this formulation to a dynamic module selection setting, enabling\ninference-time selection of relevant LoRA adapters from a large pool.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no open-source work currently\noffers a feature set as rich as proprietary models (O3), which can perform\ndiverse image manipulations and simultaneously enhance logical reasoning\ncapabilities through code. In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in this\ndirection by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm for\nenabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches by\nautonomously generating and executing diverse image processing and\ncomputational operations via executable code. This approach not only\nfacilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping,\nrotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations,\nall while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these\noperations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy:\nan initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation,\nfollowed by a RL phase to refine decision-making.

With a\nprevalence exceeding 70%, they pose a significant burden on female reproductive\nhealth. Clinical symptoms such as abnormal uterine bleeding, infertility,\npelvic pain, and pressure-related discomfort play a crucial role in guiding\ntreatment decisions, which are largely influenced by the size, number, and\nanatomical location of the fibroids. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a\nnon-invasive and highly accurate imaging modality commonly used by clinicians\nfor the diagnosis of uterine fibroids. Segmenting uterine fibroids requires a\nprecise assessment of both the uterus and fibroids on MRI scans, including\nmeasurements of volume, shape, and spatial location. However, this process is\nlabor intensive and time consuming and subjected to variability due to intra-\nand inter-expert differences at both pre- and post-treatment stages. As a\nresult, there is a critical need for an accurate and automated segmentation\nmethod for uterine fibroids. In recent years, deep learning algorithms have\nshown re-markable improvements in medical image segmentation, outperforming\ntraditional methods.

Consequently, some recent studies have focused on\nenhancing the robustness of ST fusion methods against noise.

To address this issue, TSSTF introduces\ntwo key mechanisms: Temporally-Guided Total Variation (TGTV) and\nTemporally-Guided Edge Constraint (TGEC). TGTV is a novel regularization\nfunction that promotes spatial piecewise smoothness while preserving structural\ndetails, guided by a reference high spatial resolution image acquired on a\nnearby date.
