Existing Text-to-Image (T2I) models often produce outputs that are visually plausible yet scientifically incorrect, resulting in a persistent visual-logic divergence that limits their value for downstream reasoning. Motivated by recent advances in next-generation T2I models, we conduct a systematic study of scientific image synthesis across generation paradigms, evaluation, and downstream use. We analyze both direct pixel-based generation and programmatic synthesis, and propose ImgCoder, a logic-driven framework that follows an explicit \"understand - plan - code\" workflow to improve structural precision. To rigorously assess scientific correctness, we introduce SciGenBench, which evaluates generated images based on information utility and logical validity. Our evaluation reveals systematic failure modes in pixel-based models and highlights a fundamental expressiveness-precision trade-off. Finally, we show that fine-tuning Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on rigorously verified synthetic scientific images yields consistent reasoning gains, with potential scaling trends analogous to the text domain, validating high-fidelity scientific synthesis as a viable path to unlocking massive multimodal reasoning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faImgCoder\u6846\u67b6\u548cSciGenBench\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u903b\u8f91\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\"\u7406\u89e3-\u89c4\u5212-\u7f16\u7801\"\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u63d0\u5347\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf(T2I)\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u867d\u7136\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u4f46\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0a\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u89c6\u89c9-\u903b\u8f91\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faImgCoder\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\"\u7406\u89e3-\u89c4\u5212-\u7f16\u7801\"\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u9a71\u52a8\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff1b\u5efa\u7acbSciGenBench\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4ece\u4fe1\u606f\u6548\u7528\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u50cf\u7d20\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u5408\u6210\u4e24\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u50cf\u7d20\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5408\u6210\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u9886\u57df\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u662f\u89e3\u9501\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u903b\u8f91\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Accurate segmentation, particularly for complex pathologies like meningiomas, demands that models fully exploit the latent information within limited high-quality annotations. To maximize the value of existing datasets, we propose a novel dual-augmentation framework that synergistically integrates spatial manifold expansion and semantic object injection. Specifically, we leverage Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to model continuous velocity fields. Unlike previous methods, we perform linear mixing on the integrated deformation fields, enabling the efficient generation of anatomically plausible variations by interpolating within the deformation space. This approach allows for the extensive exploration of structural diversity from a small set of anchors. Furthermore, we introduce a Sim2Real lesion injection module. This module constructs a high-fidelity simulation domain by transplanting lesion textures into healthy anatomical backgrounds, effectively bridging the gap between synthetic augmentation and real-world pathology.

Monitoring patients with these diseases involves the observation of peripheral blood samples under a microscope, a time-consuming procedure. Moreover, a specialist is required to perform this technique, and owing to the subjective nature of the observation of isolated RBCs, the error rate is high. In this paper, we propose an automated method for differentially enumerating RBCs that uses peripheral blood smear image analysis. In this method, the objects of interest in the image are segmented using a Chan-Vese active contour model. An analysis is then performed to classify the RBCs, also called erythrocytes, as normal or elongated or having other deformations, using the basic shape analysis descriptors: circular shape factor (CSF) and elliptical shape factor (ESF). To analyze cells that become partially occluded in a cluster during sample preparation, an elliptical adjustment is performed to allow the analysis of erythrocytes with discoidal and elongated shapes. The images of patient blood samples used in the study were acquired by a clinical laboratory specialist in the Special Hematology Department of the ``Dr. Juan Bruno Zayas'' General Hospital in Santiago de Cuba. A comparison of the results obtained by the proposed method in our experiments with those obtained by some state-of-the-art methods showed that the proposed method is superior for the diagnosis of sickle cell anemia. This superiority is achieved for evidenced by the obtained F-measure value (0.97 for normal cells and 0.95 for elongated ones) and several overall multiclass performance measures.

Despite rapid growth in machine learning, vision language models (VLMs) still fail to understand or generate basic visual concepts such as object orientation, quantity, or spatial relationships, which highlighted gaps in elementary visual reasoning. By adapting MMVP benchmark questions into explicit and implicit prompts, we create \\textit{AMVICC}, a novel benchmark for profiling failure modes across various modalities. After testing 11 MLLMs and 3 IGMs in nine categories of visual reasoning, our results show that failure modes are often shared between models and modalities, but certain failures are model-specific and modality-specific, and this can potentially be attributed to various factors. IGMs consistently struggled to manipulate specific visual components in response to prompts, especially in explicit prompts, suggesting poor control over fine-grained visual attributes. Our findings apply most directly to the evaluation of existing state-of-the-art models on structured visual reasoning tasks.

A novel dataset comprising 1,800 balanced, high-quality images representing four material categories, Ceramic/Tile, Concrete, Trash/Waste, and Wood was collected from real construction sites in the UAE, capturing diverse real-world conditions. Deep features were extracted using a pre-trained Xception network, and multiple ML classifiers, including SVM, kNN, Bagged Trees, LDA, and Logistic Regression, were systematically evaluated. The results demonstrate that hybrid pipelines using Xception features with simple classifiers such as Linear SVM, kNN, and Bagged Trees achieve state-of-the-art performance, with up to 99.5\\% accuracy and macro-F1 scores, surpassing more complex or end-to-end deep learning approaches.

While deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for mangrove detection, its progress is hindered by the limitations of existing datasets. In particular, many resources provide only annual map products without curated single-date image-mask pairs, limited to specific regions rather than global coverage, or remain inaccessible to the public. To address these challenges, we introduce MANGO, a large-scale global dataset comprising 42,703 labeled image-mask pairs across 124 countries. To construct this dataset, we retrieve all available Sentinel-2 imagery within the year 2020 for mangrove regions and select the best single-date observations that align with the mangrove annual mask. This selection is performed using a target detection-driven approach that leverages pixel-wise coordinate references to ensure adaptive and representative image-mask pairings.

However, existing recognition systems face significant challenges due to their reliance on single sensor approaches like Leap Motion or RGB cameras. These systems struggle with limitations such as inadequate tracking of complex hand orientations and imprecise recognition of 3D hand movements. This research paper aims to investigate the potential of a multimodal approach that combines Leap Motion and RGB camera data to explore the feasibility of recognition of ArSL. The system architecture includes two parallel subnetworks: a custom dense neural network for Leap Motion data, incorporating dropout and L2 regularization, and an image subnetwork based on a fine-tuned VGG16 model enhanced with data augmentation techniques. Feature representations from both modalities are concatenated in a fusion model and passed through fully connected layers, with final classification performed via SoftMax activation to analyze spatial and temporal features of hand gestures. The system was evaluated on a custom dataset comprising 18 ArSL words, of which 13 were correctly recognized, yielding an overall accuracy of 78%.

However, in existing designs, tight coupling between \"membership matrix\" and \"subspace matrix U\" in MCR2 causes redundant coding under incorrect token projection. To this end, we decouple the functional relationship between the \"membership matrix\" and \"subspaces U\" in the MCR2 objective and derive an interpretable sparse linear attention operator from unrolled gradient descent of the optimized objective. Specifically, we propose to directly learn the membership matrix from inputs and subsequently derive sparse subspaces from the fullspace S. Consequently, gradient unrolling of the optimized MCR2 objective yields an interpretable sparse linear attention operator: Decoupled Membership-Subspace Attention (DMSA). Experimental results on visual tasks show that simply replacing the attention module in Token Statistics Transformer (ToST) with DMSA (we refer to as DMST) not only achieves a faster coding reduction rate but also outperforms ToST by 1.08%-1.45% in top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset.

Current paradigms struggle to disentangle these factors without massive supervised datasets, often reducing noise to mere interference rather than an information resource. Here, we introduce \"Noisomics\", a framework shifting the focus from suppression to systematic noise decoding via the Contrastive Pre-trained (CoP) Foundation Model. By leveraging the manifold hypothesis and synthetic noise genome, CoP employs contrastive learning to disentangle semantic signals from stochastic perturbations. Crucially, CoP breaks traditional deep learning scaling laws, achieving superior performance with only 100 training samples, outperforming supervised baselines trained on 100,000 samples, thereby reducing data and computational dependency by three orders of magnitude. Extensive benchmarking across 12 diverse out-of-domain datasets confirms its robust zero-shot generalization, demonstrating a 63.8% reduction in estimation error and an 85.1% improvement in the coefficient of determination compared to the conventional training strategy. We demonstrate CoP's utility across scales: from deciphering non-linear hardware-noise interplay in consumer photography to optimizing photon-efficient protocols for deep-tissue microscopy.

Traditional analysis using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) often requires labor-intensive, manual evaluation of feature geometry, limiting throughput and reproducibility. In this study, we propose SiMiC: Context-Aware Silicon Microstructure Characterization Using Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Networks for Field-Emission Tip Analysis. By leveraging deep learning, our approach efficiently extracts morphological features-such as size, shape, and apex curvature-from SEM images, significantly reducing human intervention while improving measurement consistency. A specialized dataset of silicon-based field-emitter tips was developed, and a customized CNN architecture incorporating attention mechanisms was trained for multi-class microstructure classification and dimensional prediction. Comparative analysis with classical image processing techniques demonstrates that SiMiC achieves high accuracy while maintaining interpretability. The proposed framework establishes a foundation for data-driven microstructure analysis directly linked to field-emission performance, opening avenues for correlating emitter geometry with emission behavior and guiding the design of optimized cold-cathode and SEM electron sources.

The challenge aims to address the critical need for automated recognition of unusual behaviors in facilities for individuals with developmental disabilities using non-invasive pose estimation data. Participating teams were tasked with distinguishing between normal and unusual activities based on skeleton keypoints extracted from video recordings of simulated scenarios. The dataset reflects real-world imbalance and temporal irregularities in behavior, and the evaluation adopted a Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) strategy to ensure subject-agnostic generalization. The challenge attracted broad participation from 40 teams applying diverse approaches ranging from classical machine learning to deep learning architectures. Submissions were assessed primarily using macro-averaged F1 scores to account for class imbalance. The results highlight the difficulty of modeling rare, abrupt actions in noisy, low-dimensional data, and emphasize the importance of capturing both temporal and contextual nuances in behavior modeling.

We welcome any feedback and suggestions for improvement. Please feel free to contact us at an.hongjun@foxmail.com", "summary": "Adverse social interactions, such as bullying, harassment, and other illicit activities, pose significant threats to individual well-being and public safety, leaving profound impacts on physical and mental health. However, these critical events frequently occur in privacy-sensitive environments like restrooms, and changing rooms, where conventional surveillance is prohibited or severely restricted by stringent privacy regulations and ethical concerns. Here, we propose the Single-Pixel Vision-Language Model (SP-VLM), a novel framework that reimagines secure environmental monitoring. It achieves intrinsic privacy-by-design by capturing human dynamics through inherently low-dimensional single-pixel modalities and inferring complex behavioral patterns via seamless vision-language integration. Building on this framework, we demonstrate that single-pixel sensing intrinsically suppresses identity recoverability, rendering state-of-the-art face recognition systems ineffective below a critical sampling rate. We further show that SP-VLM can nonetheless extract meaningful behavioral semantics, enabling robust anomaly detection, people counting, and activity understanding from severely degraded single-pixel observations. Combining these findings, we identify a practical sampling-rate regime in which behavioral intelligence emerges while personal identity remains strongly protected.

However, it is rarely quantified in clinical practice. Existing continuous monitoring systems with commercially available wearable activity trackers are typically developed in middle-aged adults and therefore perform unreliably in older adults with slower and more variable gait patterns. This study aimed to develop a robust human activity recognition (HAR) system to improve continuous physical activity recognition in the context of hip fracture rehabilitation. 24 healthy older adults aged over 80 years were included to perform activities of daily living (walking, standing, sitting, lying down, and postural transfers) under simulated free-living conditions for 75 minutes while wearing two accelerometers positioned on the lower back and anterior upper thigh. Model robustness was evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The synthetic data demonstrated potential to improve generalization across participants. The resulting feature intervention model (FIM), aided by synthetic data guidance, achieved reliable activity recognition with mean F1-scores of 0.896 for walking, 0.927 for standing, 0.997 for sitting, 0.937 for lying down, and 0.816 for postural transfers. Compared with a control condition model without synthetic data, the FIM significantly improved the postural transfer detection, i.e., an activity class of high clinical relevance that is often overlooked in existing HAR literature. In conclusion, these preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of robust activity recognition in older adults. Further validation in hip fracture patient populations is required to assess the clinical utility of the proposed monitoring system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7528\u4e8e\u9acb\u90e8\u9aa8\u6298\u5eb7\u590d\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u8001\u5e74\u60a3\u8005\u6d3b\u52a8\u76d1\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "motivation": "\u9acb\u90e8\u9aa8\u6298\u5eb7\u590d\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u8eab\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u76d1\u6d4b\u5bf9\u8001\u5e74\u60a3\u8005\u529f\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u9752\u5e74\u4eba\u7fa4\uff0c\u5728\u8001\u5e74\u60a3\u8005\u6b65\u6001\u7f13\u6162\u591a\u53d8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u7eb3\u516524\u540d80\u5c81\u4ee5\u4e0a\u5065\u5eb7\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u81ea\u7531\u751f\u6d3b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c75\u5206\u949f\u65e5\u5e38\u6d3b\u52a8\uff08\u884c\u8d70\u3001\u7ad9\u7acb\u3001\u5750\u3001\u8eba\u3001\u59ff\u52bf\u8f6c\u6362\uff09\uff0c\u4f69\u6234\u8170\u90e8\u548c\u5927\u817f\u524d\u4fa7\u4e24\u4e2a\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u8ba1\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u7559\u4e00\u6cd5\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5065\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7279\u5f81\u5e72\u9884\u6a21\u578b\uff08FIM\uff09", "result": "FIM\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8f85\u52a9\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u6548\u679c\uff1a\u884c\u8d70F1\u5206\u65700.896\u3001\u7ad9\u7acb0.927\u3001\u57500.997\u3001\u8eba0.937\u3001\u59ff\u52bf\u8f6c\u63620.816\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\uff0cFIM\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u59ff\u52bf\u8f6c\u6362\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "\u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u7fa4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5728\u9acb\u90e8\u9aa8\u6298\u60a3\u8005\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6240\u63d0\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027"}}

Existing benchmarks for egocentric domain generalization often conflate covariate shifts with concept shifts, making it difficult to reliably evaluate a model's ability to generalize across input distributions. To address this limitation, we introduce Ego4OOD, a domain generalization benchmark derived from Ego4D that emphasizes measurable covariate diversity while reducing concept shift through semantically coherent, moment-level action categories. Ego4OOD spans eight geographically distinct domains and is accompanied by a clustering-based covariate shift metric that provides a quantitative proxy for domain difficulty. We further leverage a one-vs-all binary training objective that decomposes multi-class action recognition into independent binary classification tasks. This formulation is particularly well-suited for covariate shift by reducing interference between visually similar classes under feature distribution shift. Using this formulation, we show that a lightweight two-layer fully connected network achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art egocentric domain generalization methods on both Argo1M and Ego4OOD, despite using fewer parameters and no additional modalities.

Traditionally, this process demands physical inspection, introducing delays due to range safety protocols and increasing the risk of human error. We present an end-to-end computer vision system for automated bullet hole detection and iteration-based tracking directly from images taken at the firing line. Our approach combines YOLOv8 for accurate small-object detection with Intersection over Union (IoU) analysis to differentiate bullet holes across sequential images. To address the scarcity of labeled sequential data, we propose a novel data augmentation technique that removes rather than adds objects to simulate realistic firing sequences. Additionally, we introduce a preprocessing pipeline that standardizes target orientation using ORB-based perspective correction, improving model accuracy. Our system achieves 97.0% mean average precision on bullet hole detection and 88.8% accuracy in assigning bullet holes to the correct firing iteration.

However, a gap remains between contemporary \"stateless\" video architectures and classic state-centric world model theories. This work bridges this gap by proposing a novel taxonomy centered on two pillars: State Construction and Dynamics Modeling. We categorize state construction into implicit paradigms (context management) and explicit paradigms (latent compression), while dynamics modeling is analyzed through knowledge integration and architectural reformulation. Furthermore, we advocate for a transition in evaluation from visual fidelity to functional benchmarks, testing physical persistence and causal reasoning. We conclude by identifying two critical frontiers: enhancing persistence via data-driven memory and compressed fidelity, and advancing causality through latent factor decoupling and reasoning-prior integration.

However, directly applying existing fine-tuning methods to remote sensing (RS) images often leads to issues such as overfitting on background noise or neglecting target details. This is primarily due to the large-scale variations, sparse target distributions, and complex regional semantic features inherent in RS images. These challenges limit the effectiveness of MLLMs in RS tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy called Guided Region-Aware Sparse Prompting (GRASP).

However, traditional LoD modeling processes rely on manual operations that are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to geometric inconsistencies. While the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new possibilities for generating multi-level architectural models from sketch inputs, its application remains limited by the lack of high-quality paired LoD training data. To address this issue, we propose an automatic LoD sketch extraction framework using generative AI models, which progressively simplifies high-detail architectural models to automatically generate geometrically consistent and hierarchically coherent multi-LoD representations. The proposed framework integrates computer vision techniques with generative AI methods to establish a progressive extraction pipeline that transitions from detailed representations to volumetric abstractions. Experimental results demonstrate that the method maintains strong geometric consistency across LoD levels, achieving SSIM values of 0.7319 and 0.7532 for the transitions from LoD3 to LoD2 and from LoD2 to LoD1, respectively, with corresponding normalized Hausdorff distances of 25.1% and 61.0% of the image diagonal, reflecting controlled geometric deviation during abstraction. These results verify that the proposed framework effectively preserves global structure while achieving progressive semantic simplification across different LoD levels, providing reliable data and technical support for AI-driven multi-level architectural generation and hierarchical modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u81ea\u52a8LoD\u8349\u56fe\u63d0\u53d6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u7b80\u5316\u9ad8\u7ec6\u8282\u5efa\u7b51\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u5c42\u6b21\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u591aLoD\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5efa\u7b51\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u591a\u7ec6\u8282\u5c42\u6b21\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6570\u636e\u77ed\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5efa\u7b51\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9700\u8981\u8de8\u591a\u4e2a\u7ec6\u8282\u5c42\u6b21(LoD)\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edfLoD\u5efa\u6a21\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u8017\u65f6\u8d39\u529b\u4e14\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u4e3a\u4ece\u8349\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u591a\u7ea7\u5efa\u7b51\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u914d\u5bf9\u7684LoD\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8LoD\u8349\u56fe\u63d0\u53d6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u6280\u672f\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4ece\u8be6\u7ec6\u8868\u793a\u5230\u4f53\u79ef\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u63d0\u53d6\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u7b80\u5316\u9ad8\u7ec6\u8282\u5efa\u7b51\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u5c42\u6b21\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u591aLoD\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728LoD\u7ea7\u522b\u95f4\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1aLoD3\u5230LoD2\u7684SSIM\u4e3a0.7319\uff0cLoD2\u5230LoD1\u7684SSIM\u4e3a0.7532\uff1b\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316Hausdorff\u8ddd\u79bb\u5206\u522b\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ebf\u768425.1%\u548c61.0%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u62bd\u8c61\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u51e0\u4f55\u504f\u5dee\u5f97\u5230\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4e0d\u540cLoD\u7ea7\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6e10\u8fdb\u8bed\u4e49\u7b80\u5316\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u7ea7\u5efa\u7b51\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Confidence intervals (CIs) play a central role in this process by indicating how precise a reported performance estimate is. Yet, due to the limited amount of work examining CI behavior in medical imaging, the community remains largely unaware of how many diverse CI methods exist and how they behave in specific settings. The purpose of this study is to close this gap. To this end, we conducted a large-scale empirical analysis across a total of 24 segmentation and classification tasks, using 19 trained models per task group, a broad spectrum of commonly used performance metrics, multiple aggregation strategies, and several widely adopted CI methods. Reliability (coverage) and precision (width) of each CI method were estimated across all settings to characterize their dependence on study characteristics. Our analysis revealed five principal findings: 1) the sample size required for reliable CIs varies from a few dozens to several thousands of cases depending on study parameters; 2) CI behavior is strongly affected by the choice of performance metric; 3) aggregation strategy substantially influences the reliability of CIs, e.g. they require more observations for macro than for micro; 4) the machine learning problem (segmentation versus classification) modulates these effects; 5) different CI methods are not equally reliable and precise depending on the use case.

Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP) 2026", "summary": "Annotating medical data for training AI models is often costly and limited due to the shortage of specialists with relevant clinical expertise. This challenge is further compounded by privacy and ethical concerns associated with sensitive patient information. As a result, well-trained medical segmentation models on private datasets constitute valuable intellectual property requiring robust protection mechanisms. Existing model protection techniques primarily focus on classification and generative tasks, while segmentation models-crucial to medical image analysis-remain largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel, stealthy, and harmless method, StealthMark, for verifying the ownership of medical segmentation models under black-box conditions. Our approach subtly modulates model uncertainty without altering the final segmentation outputs, thereby preserving the model's performance. To enable ownership verification, we incorporate model-agnostic explanation methods, e.g. LIME, to extract feature attributions from the model outputs. Under specific triggering conditions, these explanations reveal a distinct and verifiable watermark. We further design the watermark as a QR code to facilitate robust and recognizable ownership claims. We conducted extensive experiments across four medical imaging datasets and five mainstream segmentation models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness, stealthiness, and harmlessness of our method on the original model's segmentation performance. For example, when applied to the SAM model, StealthMark consistently achieved ASR above 95% across various datasets while maintaining less than a 1% drop in Dice and AUC scores, significantly outperforming backdoor-based watermarking methods and highlighting its strong potential for practical deployment.

This divide, rooted in the distinction between VQ-VAEs and VAEs, hinders unified modeling and fair benchmarking. Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) offers a theoretical bridge, yet vanilla FSQ suffers from a critical flaw: its equal-interval quantization can cause activation collapse. This mismatch forces a trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and information efficiency. In this work, we resolve this dilemma by simply replacing the activation function in original FSQ with a distribution-matching mapping to enforce a uniform prior. Termed iFSQ, this simple strategy requires just one line of code yet mathematically guarantees both optimal bin utilization and reconstruction precision. Leveraging iFSQ as a controlled benchmark, we uncover two key insights: (1) The optimal equilibrium between discrete and continuous representations lies at approximately 4 bits per dimension. (2) Under identical reconstruction constraints, AR models exhibit rapid initial convergence, whereas diffusion models achieve a superior performance ceiling, suggesting that strict sequential ordering may limit the upper bounds of generation quality. Finally, we extend our analysis by adapting Representation Alignment (REPA) to AR models, yielding LlamaGen-REPA.

Yet in civil and built-environment research, there is no consistent and privacy-preserving way to represent and measure socially meaningful interaction in these spaces, leaving studies to operationalize \"interaction\" differently across contexts and limiting practitioners' ability to evaluate whether design interventions are changing the forms of interaction that social capital theory predicts should matter. To address this field-level and methodological gap, we introduce the Dyadic User Engagement DataseT (DUET) dataset and an embedded kinesics recognition framework that operationalize Ekman and Friesen's kinesics taxonomy as a function-level interaction vocabulary aligned with social capital-relevant behaviors (e.g., reciprocity and attention coordination). DUET captures 12 dyadic interactions spanning all five kinesic functions-emblems, illustrators, affect displays, adaptors, and regulators-across four sensing modalities and three built-environment contexts, enabling privacy-preserving analysis of communicative intent through movement. Benchmarking six open-source, state-of-the-art human activity recognition models quantifies the difficulty of communicative-function recognition on DUET and highlights the limitations of ubiquitous monadic, action-level recognition when extended to dyadic, socially grounded interaction measurement. Building on DUET, our recognition framework infers communicative function directly from privacy-preserving skeletal motion without handcrafted action-to-function dictionaries; using a transfer-learning architecture, it reveals structured clustering of kinesic functions and a strong association between representation quality and classification performance while generalizing across subjects and contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DUET\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u5730\u6d4b\u91cf\u793e\u4f1a\u8d44\u672c\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5efa\u7b51\u73af\u5883\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u793e\u4f1a\u4e92\u52a8\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5efa\u7b51\u73af\u5883\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u4e92\u52a8\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\"\u4e92\u52a8\"\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e72\u9884\u6548\u679c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165DUET\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eEkman\u548cFriesen\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u6355\u634912\u79cd\u4e8c\u5143\u4e92\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u9aa8\u9abc\u8fd0\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u76f4\u63a5\u63a8\u65ad\u6c9f\u901a\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6c9f\u901a\u529f\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u8de8\u4e3b\u4f53\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u3002", "conclusion": "DUET\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5efa\u7b51\u73af\u5883\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u4e92\u52a8\u6d4b\u91cf\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e72\u9884\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u8d44\u672c\u76f8\u5173\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Conventional approaches rely on transmitting raw video or high-dimensional sensory data from roadside units (RSUs) to vehicles, which is impractical under vehicular communication bandwidth and latency constraints. In this work, we propose a semantic V2X framework in which RSU-mounted cameras generate spatiotemporal semantic embeddings of future frames using the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA). To evaluate the system, we construct a digital twin of an urban traffic environment enabling the generation of d verse traffic scenarios with both safe and collision events. These embeddings of the future frame, extracted from V-JEPA, capture task-relevant traffic dynamics and are transmitted via V2X links to vehicles, where a lightweight attentive probe and classifier decode them to predict imminent collisions. By transmitting only semantic embeddings instead of raw frames, the proposed system significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining predictive accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework with an appropriate processing method achieves a 10% F1-score improvement for collision prediction while reducing transmission requirements by four orders of magnitude compared to raw video. This validates the potential of semantic V2X communication to enable cooperative, real-time collision prediction in ITS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49V2X\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u78b0\u649e\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528V-JEPA\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u66ff\u4ee3\u539f\u59cb\u89c6\u9891\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u65f6\u78b0\u649e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f20\u8f93\u539f\u59cb\u89c6\u9891\u6216\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8f66\u8054\u7f51\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u4e49V2X\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u8def\u4fa7\u5355\u5143\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u4f7f\u7528V-JEPA\u751f\u6210\u672a\u6765\u5e27\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7V2X\u94fe\u8def\u4f20\u8f93\u5230\u8f66\u8f86\uff0c\u7531\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a2\u9488\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u89e3\u7801\u9884\u6d4b\u78b0\u649e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u78b0\u649e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b010%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f20\u8f93\u9700\u6c42\u76f8\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u89c6\u9891\u964d\u4f4e\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49V2X\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49V2X\u901a\u4fe1\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u534f\u4f5c\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

Existing approaches either fail to leverage unlabeled data from the target domain or rely on image-to-image translation, which can distort tissue structures and compromise model accuracy. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) framework that utilizes a latent diffusion model trained on unlabeled data from both the source and target domains to generate morphology-preserving and target-aware synthetic images. By conditioning the diffusion model on foundation model features, cohort identity, and tissue preparation method, we preserve tissue structure in the source domain while introducing target-domain appearance characteristics. The target-aware synthetic images, combined with real, labeled images from the source cohort, are subsequently used to train a downstream classifier, which is then tested on the target cohort. The effectiveness of the proposed SSDA framework is demonstrated on the task of lung adenocarcinoma prognostication. The proposed augmentation yielded substantially better performance on the held-out test set from the target cohort, without degrading source-cohort performance. The approach improved the weighted F1 score on the target-cohort held-out test set from 0.611 to 0.706 and the macro F1 score from 0.641 to 0.716. Our results demonstrate that target-aware diffusion-based synthetic data augmentation provides a promising and effective approach for improving domain generalization in computational pathology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u7559\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5f62\u6001\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u8ba1\u7b97\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u56e0\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u961f\u5217\u548c\u673a\u6784\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7684\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u53ef\u80fd\u626d\u66f2\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5728\u6e90\u57df\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u961f\u5217\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5236\u5907\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u7559\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u5916\u89c2\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u80ba\u817a\u764c\u9884\u540e\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u52a0\u6743F1\u5206\u6570\u4ece0.611\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.706\uff0c\u5b8f\u89c2F1\u5206\u6570\u4ece0.641\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.716\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u964d\u4f4e\u6e90\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u4e3a\u6539\u5584\u8ba1\u7b97\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Despite growing interest, the evaluation of VAU remains an open challenge. Existing benchmarks rely on n-gram-based metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE-L) or LLM-based evaluation. The first fails to capture the rich, free-form, and visually grounded nature of LVLM responses, while the latter focuses on assessing language quality over factual relevance, often resulting in subjective judgments that are misaligned with human perception. In this work, we address this issue by proposing FineVAU, a new benchmark for VAU that shifts the focus towards rich, fine-grained and domain-specific understanding of anomalous videos. We formulate VAU as a three-fold problem, with the goal of comprehensively understanding key descriptive elements of anomalies in video: events (What), participating entities (Who) and location (Where). Our benchmark introduces a) FVScore, a novel, human-aligned evaluation metric that assesses the presence of critical visual elements in LVLM answers, providing interpretable, fine-grained feedback; and b) FineW3, a novel, comprehensive dataset curated through a structured and fully automatic procedure that augments existing human annotations with high quality, fine-grained visual information. Human evaluation reveals that our proposed metric has a superior alignment with human perception of anomalies in comparison to current approaches. Detailed experiments on FineVAU unveil critical limitations in LVLM's ability to perceive anomalous events that require spatial and fine-grained temporal understanding, despite strong performance on coarse grain, static information, and events with strong visual cues.", "AI": {"tldr": "FineVAU\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542bFineW3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cFVScore\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349LVLM\u4e30\u5bcc\u89c6\u89c9\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u7406\u89e3(VAU)\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8en-gram\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982BLEU\u3001ROUGE-L\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349LVLM\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5219\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5173\u6ce8\u8bed\u8a00\u8d28\u91cf\u800c\u975e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "method": "1) \u5c06VAU\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4e8b\u4ef6(What)\u3001\u53c2\u4e0e\u5b9e\u4f53(Who)\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e(Where)\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51faFVScore\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LVLM\u56de\u7b54\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u89c6\u89c9\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u53cd\u9988\uff1b3) \u521b\u5efaFineW3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u6d41\u7a0b\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u6709\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793aFVScore\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u3002\u8be6\u7ec6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LVLM\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u4e8b\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u9759\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "FineVAU\u57fa\u51c6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VAU\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dLVLM\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u7406\u89e3\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We present an inference-time, region-constrained color preservation method that steers a pretrained diffusion model without any additional training. Our approach combines (i) ROI-based inpainting for spatial selectivity, (ii) background-latent re-imposition to prevent color drift outside the ROI, and (iii) latent nudging via gradient guidance using a composite loss defined in CIE Lab and linear RGB. The loss is constructed to control not only the mean ROI color but also the tail of the pixelwise error distribution through CVaR-style and soft-maximum penalties, with a late-start gate and a time-dependent schedule to stabilize guidance across denoising steps. We show that mean-only baselines can satisfy average color constraints while producing perceptually salient local failures, motivating our distribution-aware objective.

Existing methods attempt to leverage complementary information from multiple projections, but struggle with balancing global and local consistency. Their local patch features have limited global perception, and the combined global representation does not address discrepancies in feature extraction at the boundaries between patches. To address these issues, we propose Cross360, a novel cross-attention-based architecture integrating local and global information using less-distorted tangent patches along with equirectangular features. Our Cross Projection Feature Alignment module employs cross-attention to align local tangent projection features with the equirectangular projection's 360\u00b0 field of view, ensuring each tangent projection patch is aware of the global context.

Although State Space Models (SSMs) offer near-linear computational complexity, their dependence on rigid, axis-aligned scanning trajectories induces a fundamental topological mismatch with curvilinear targets, resulting in fragmented context and feature erosion. To bridge this gap, we propose Fluxamba, a lightweight architecture that introduces a topology-aware feature rectification framework. Central to our design is the Structural Flux Block (SFB), which orchestrates an anisotropic information flux by integrating an Anisotropic Structural Gate (ASG) with a Prior-Modulated Flow (PMF). This mechanism decouples feature orientation from spatial location, dynamically gating context aggregation along the target's intrinsic geometry rather than rigid paths. Furthermore, to mitigate serialization-induced noise in low-contrast environments, we incorporate a Hierarchical Spatial Regulator (HSR) for multi-scale semantic alignment and a High-Fidelity Focus Unit (HFFU) to explicitly maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of faint features. Extensive experiments on diverse geological benchmarks (LROC-Lineament, LineaMapper, and GeoCrack) demonstrate that Fluxamba establishes a new state-of-the-art. Notably, on the challenging LROC-Lineament dataset, it achieves an F1-score of 89.22% and mIoU of 89.87%. Achieving a real-time inference speed of over 24 FPS with only 3.4M parameters and 6.3G FLOPs, Fluxamba reduces computational costs by up to two orders of magnitude compared to heavy-weight baselines, thereby establishing a new Pareto frontier between segmentation fidelity and onboard deployment feasibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "Fluxamba\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u6821\u6b63\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u5730\u8d28\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff08SSMs\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u521a\u6027\u7684\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\u626b\u63cf\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4e0e\u66f2\u7ebf\u76ee\u6807\u5b58\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u788e\u7247\u5316\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u4fb5\u8680\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u62d3\u6251\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFluxamba\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u7ed3\u6784\u901a\u91cf\u5757\uff08SFB\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u95e8\uff08ASG\uff09\u548c\u5148\u9a8c\u8c03\u5236\u6d41\uff08PMF\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u5411\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u6cbf\u76ee\u6807\u5185\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u52a8\u6001\u805a\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002\u8fd8\u5305\u542b\u5206\u5c42\u7a7a\u95f4\u8c03\u8282\u5668\uff08HSR\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u805a\u7126\u5355\u5143\uff08HFFU\uff09\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5fae\u5f31\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5730\u8d28\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08LROC-Lineament\u3001LineaMapper\u3001GeoCrack\uff09\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684LROC-Lineament\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cF1\u5206\u657089.22%\uff0cmIoU 89.87%\u3002\u4ec53.4M\u53c2\u6570\u548c6.3G FLOPs\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc724 FPS\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6bd4\u91cd\u91cf\u7ea7\u57fa\u7ebf\u964d\u4f4e\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "Fluxamba\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u6821\u6b63\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5730\u8d28\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5272\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u673a\u8f7d\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Conventional deep learning approaches typically formulate this problem as deterministic multi-class classification, ignoring both the continuous progression of degeneration and the uncertainty in expert annotations. In this work, we propose ClinNet, a novel trustworthy framework that addresses KOA grading as an evidential ordinal regression problem. The proposed method integrates three key components: (1) a Bilateral Asymmetry Encoder (BAE) that explicitly models medial-lateral structural discrepancies; (2) a Diagnostic Memory Bank that maintains class-wise prototypes to stabilize feature representations; and (3) an Evidential Ordinal Head based on the Normal-Inverse-Gamma (NIG) distribution to jointly estimate continuous KL grades and epistemic uncertainty. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ClinNet achieves a Quadratic Weighted Kappa of 0.892 and Accuracy of 0.768, statistically outperforming state-of-the-art baselines (p < 0.001).

In this end, we present SkyReels-V3, a conditional video generation model, built upon a unified multimodal in-context learning framework with diffusion Transformers. SkyReels-V3 model supports three core generative paradigms within a single architecture: reference images-to-video synthesis, video-to-video extension and audio-guided video generation. (i) reference images-to-video model is designed to produce high-fidelity videos with strong subject identity preservation, temporal coherence, and narrative consistency. To enhance reference adherence and compositional stability, we design a comprehensive data processing pipeline that leverages cross frame pairing, image editing, and semantic rewriting, effectively mitigating copy paste artifacts. During training, an image video hybrid strategy combined with multi-resolution joint optimization is employed to improve generalization and robustness across diverse scenarios. (ii) video extension model integrates spatio-temporal consistency modeling with large-scale video understanding, enabling both seamless single-shot continuation and intelligent multi-shot switching with professional cinematographic patterns. (iii) Talking avatar model supports minute-level audio-conditioned video generation by training first-and-last frame insertion patterns and reconstructing key-frame inference paradigms. On the basis of ensuring visual quality, synchronization of audio and videos has been optimized.\n  Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SkyReels-V3 achieves state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance on key metrics including visual quality, instruction following, and specific aspect metrics, approaching leading closed-source systems.

In sequential letter presentation, the afterimage of one symbol can interfere with perception of the next, leading to systematic recognition errors. Rather than relying on future hardware improvements, we investigate whether optimizing the visual symbols themselves can mitigate this temporal interference. We present SymbolSight, a computational framework that selects symbol-to-letter mappings to minimize confusion among frequently adjacent letters. Using simulated prosthetic vision (SPV) and a neural proxy observer, we estimate pairwise symbol confusability and optimize assignments using language-specific bigram statistics. Across simulations in Arabic, Bulgarian, and English, the resulting heterogeneous symbol sets reduced predicted confusion by a median factor of 22 relative to native alphabets.

While convolutional neural network-, Transformer-, and Mamba-based U-Net variants have achieved strong performance, they still struggle to capture geometric and structural cues, especially in low-contrast or cluttered colonoscopy scenes. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Geometric Prior-guided Module (GPM) that injects explicit geometric priors into U-Net-based architectures for polyp segmentation. Specifically, we fine-tune the Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) on a simulated ColonDepth dataset to estimate depth maps of polyp images tailored to the endoscopic domain. These depth maps are then processed by GPM to encode geometric priors into the encoder's feature maps, where they are further refined using spatial and channel attention mechanisms that emphasize both local spatial and global channel information.

However, the scarcity of text image data in existing datasets results in poor performance on text regions. In addition, datasets consisting of isolated text samples limit the quality of background reconstruction. To address these limitations, we construct Real-Texts, a large-scale, high-quality dataset collected from real-world images, which covers diverse scenarios and contains natural text instances in both Chinese and English. Additionally, we propose the TEXTS-Aware Diffusion Model (TEXTS-Diff) to achieve high-quality generation in both background and textual regions. This approach leverages abstract concepts to improve the understanding of textual elements within visual scenes and concrete text regions to enhance textual details. It mitigates distortions and hallucination artifacts commonly observed in text regions, while preserving high-quality visual scene fidelity.

However, in practical applications, the missing of modality data (e.g., optical or DSM) is a common and severe challenge, which leads to performance decline in traditional multimodal fusion models. Existing methods for addressing missing modalities still face limitations, including feature collapse and overly generalized recovered features. To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{STARS} (\\textbf{S}hared-specific \\textbf{T}ranslation and \\textbf{A}lignment for missing-modality \\textbf{R}emote \\textbf{S}ensing), a robust semantic segmentation framework for incomplete multimodal inputs. STARS is built on two key designs. First, we introduce an asymmetric alignment mechanism with bidirectional translation and stop-gradient, which effectively prevents feature collapse and reduces sensitivity to hyperparameters. Second, we propose a Pixel-level Semantic sampling Alignment (PSA) strategy that combines class-balanced pixel sampling with cross-modality semantic alignment loss, to mitigate alignment failures caused by severe class imbalance and improve minority-class recognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "STARS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u9065\u611f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u548c\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u91c7\u6837\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9065\u611f\u6280\u672f\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u5149\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u3001SAR\u548cDSM\u7b49\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5730\u8868\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\uff08\u5982\u5149\u5b66\u6216DSM\u7f3a\u5931\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e38\u89c1\u4e14\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u7279\u5f81\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u6062\u590d\u7279\u5f81\u8fc7\u4e8e\u6cdb\u5316\u7b49\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSTARS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a1\uff09\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u5411\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u505c\u6b62\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u7279\u5f81\u5d29\u6e83\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u91c7\u6837\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08PSA\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7c7b\u522b\u5e73\u8861\u50cf\u7d20\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4e25\u91cd\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u522b\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "STARS\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "STARS\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u548c\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u91c7\u6837\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u9065\u611f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

While recent methods employ disentangling strategies to simplify lightweight architectural design, such as Retinex theory and YUV color space transformations, their performance is fundamentally limited by overlooking channel-specific degradation patterns and cross-channel interactions. To address this gap, we perform a frequency-domain analysis that confirms the superiority of the YUV color space for L3IE. We identify a key insight: the Y channel primarily loses low-frequency content, while the UV channels are corrupted by high-frequency noise. Leveraging this finding, we propose a novel YUV-based paradigm that strategically restores channels using a Dual-Stream Global-Local Attention module for the Y channel, a Y-guided Local-Aware Frequency Attention module for the UV channels, and a Guided Interaction module for final feature fusion.

However, traditional classification methods such as discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and support vector machines often struggle with environmental noise in data, sensor limitations, and the computational complexity of analyzing high-dimensional HSI data. This study presents HyDeMiC (Hyperspectral Deep Learning-based Mineral Classifier), a convolutional neural network (CNN) model designed for robust mineral classification under noisy data. To train HyDeMiC, laboratory-measured hyperspectral data for 115 minerals spanning various mineral groups were used from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) library. The training dataset was generated by convolving reference mineral spectra with an HSI sensor response function. These datasets contained three copper-bearing minerals, Cuprite, Malachite, and Chalcopyrite, used as case studies for performance demonstration. The trained CNN model was evaluated on several synthetic 2D hyperspectral datasets with noise levels of 1%, 2%, 5%, and 10%. Our noisy data analysis aims to replicate realistic field conditions. The HyDeMiC's performance was assessed using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), providing a comprehensive measure across different noise regimes. Results demonstrate that HyDeMiC achieved near-perfect classification accuracy (MCC = 1.00) on clean and low-noise datasets and maintained strong performance under moderate noise conditions. These findings emphasize HyDeMiC's robustness in the presence of moderate noise, highlighting its potential for real-world applications in hyperspectral imaging, where noise is often a significant challenge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHyDeMiC\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u77ff\u7269\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u77ff\u7269\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5224\u522b\u5206\u6790\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u73af\u5883\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9650\u5236\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1HyDeMiC\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528USGS\u5e93\u4e2d115\u79cd\u77ff\u7269\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5377\u79ef\u53c2\u8003\u5149\u8c31\u4e0eHSI\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u54cd\u5e94\u51fd\u6570\u751f\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e09\u79cd\u542b\u94dc\u77ff\u7269\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\uff081%\u30012%\u30015%\u300110%\uff09\u7684\u5408\u62102D\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30", "result": "HyDeMiC\u5728\u6e05\u6d01\u548c\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08MCC = 1.00\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u52b2\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "conclusion": "HyDeMiC\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u6210\u50cf\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d"}}

While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods achieve impressive real-time modeling performance, they rely on resource-unconstrained training assumptions that fail on mobile devices, which are limited by minute-scale training budgets and hardware-available peak-memory. We present PocketGS, a mobile scene modeling paradigm that enables on-device 3DGS training under these tightly coupled constraints while preserving high perceptual fidelity. Our method resolves the fundamental contradictions of standard 3DGS through three co-designed operators: G builds geometry-faithful point-cloud priors; I injects local surface statistics to seed anisotropic Gaussians, thereby reducing early conditioning gaps; and T unrolls alpha compositing with cached intermediates and index-mapped gradient scattering for stable mobile backpropagation. Collectively, these operators satisfy the competing requirements of training efficiency, memory compactness, and modeling fidelity.

Our UCAD leverages superpixels to generate anatomically coherent regions aligned with anatomy boundaries, and an uncertainty-guided selection mechanism to selectively displace challenging regions for better consistency learning. We further propose a dynamic uncertainty-weighted consistency loss, which adaptively stabilizes training and effectively regularizes the model on unlabeled regions.

While LVLMs are known to be vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, existing methods either require access to input channels or depend on knowledge of user queries, assumptions that rarely hold in practical deployments. We propose the first Physical Prompt Injection Attack (PPIA), a black-box, query-agnostic attack that embeds malicious typographic instructions into physical objects perceivable by the LVLM. PPIA requires no access to the model, its inputs, or internal pipeline, and operates solely through visual observation. It combines offline selection of highly recognizable and semantically effective visual prompts with strategic environment-aware placement guided by spatiotemporal attention, ensuring that the injected prompts are both perceivable and influential on model behavior. We evaluate PPIA across 10 state-of-the-art LVLMs in both simulated and real-world settings on tasks including visual question answering, planning, and navigation, PPIA achieves attack success rates up to 98%, with strong robustness under varying physical conditions such as distance, viewpoint, and illumination.

Under review", "summary": "Watermarking methods have always been effective means of protecting intellectual property, yet they face significant challenges. Although existing deep learning-based watermarking systems can hide watermarks in images with minimal impact on image quality, they often lack robustness when encountering image corruptions during transmission, which undermines their practical application value. To this end, we propose a high-quality and robust watermark framework based on the diffusion model. Our method first converts the clean image into inversion noise through a null-text optimization process, and after optimizing the inversion noise in the latent space, it produces a high-quality watermarked image through an iterative denoising process of the diffusion model. The iterative denoising process serves as a powerful purification mechanism, ensuring both the visual quality of the watermarked image and enhancing the robustness of the watermark against various corruptions. To prevent the optimizing of inversion noise from distorting the original semantics of the image, we specifically introduced self-attention constraints and pseudo-mask strategies. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method against various image corruptions. In particular, our method outperforms the stable signature method by an average of 10\\% across 12 different image transformations on COCO datasets.

While static leaderboards provide snapshot rankings, they often mask the structural trade-offs between capabilities. In this work, we present ReLE (Robust Efficient Live Evaluation), a scalable system designed to diagnose Capability Anisotropy, the non-uniformity of model performance across domains. Using ReLE, we evaluate 304 models (189 commercial, 115 open-source) across a Domain $\\times$ Capability orthogonal matrix comprising 207,843 samples. We introduce two methodological contributions to address current evaluation pitfalls: (1) A Symbolic-Grounded Hybrid Scoring Mechanism that eliminates embedding-based false positives in reasoning tasks; (2) A Dynamic Variance-Aware Scheduler based on Neyman allocation with noise correction, which reduces compute costs by 70\\% compared to full-pass evaluations while maintaining a ranking correlation of $\u03c1=0.96$. Our analysis reveals that aggregate rankings are highly sensitive to weighting schemes: models exhibit a Rank Stability Amplitude (RSA) of 11.4 in ReLE versus $\\sim$5.0 in traditional benchmarks, confirming that modern models are highly specialized rather than generally superior. We position ReLE not as a replacement for comprehensive static benchmarks, but as a high-frequency diagnostic monitor for the evolving model landscape.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReLE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bca\u65ad\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e2d\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c1170%\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6392\u540d\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u800c\u975e\u666e\u904d\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e2d\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u5c55\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u4f46\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u9762\u4e34\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9971\u548c\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u9759\u6001\u6392\u884c\u699c\u53ea\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5feb\u7167\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ReLE\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u7b26\u53f7\u57fa\u7840\u6df7\u5408\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u8bef\u5224\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eNeyman\u5206\u914d\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u65b9\u5dee\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86304\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff08189\u4e2a\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c115\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u8986\u76d6207,843\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u9886\u57df\u00d7\u80fd\u529b\u6b63\u4ea4\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "result": "ReLE\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8670%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u03c1=0.96\u7684\u6392\u540d\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u805a\u5408\u6392\u540d\u5bf9\u6743\u91cd\u65b9\u6848\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u5728ReLE\u4e2d\u7684\u6392\u540d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5e45\u5ea6\u4e3a11.4\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u7ea6\u4e3a5.0\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u800c\u975e\u666e\u904d\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "conclusion": "ReLE\u4e0d\u662f\u5168\u9762\u9759\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u6f14\u5316\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u8bca\u65ad\u76d1\u63a7\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

While Vision-Language (V-L) models promise data efficiency by leveraging semantic priors, adapting them faces a critical Granularity Mismatch, where generic representations fail to resolve such subtle defects. Current adaptation methods often treat modalities as independent streams, failing to ground semantic prompts in ROI-specific visual contexts. To bridge this gap, we propose the Hierarchical Adaptation and Alignment Framework (HAAF). At its core is a novel Cross-Level Scaled Alignment (CLSA) mechanism that enforces a sequential calibration order: visual features first inject context into text prompts to generate content-adaptive descriptors, which then spatially guide the visual encoder to spotlight anomalies. Additionally, a dual-branch inference strategy integrates semantic scores with geometric prototypes to ensure stability in few-shot settings.

Traditional monitoring systems often suffer from limitations in real-time data accessibility, remote controllability, and cloud integration. This paper presents a cloud-enabled IoT system that leverages Google's Firebase Realtime Database for synchronized environmental monitoring and device control. The system utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller to interface with a DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor and an HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor, while enabling remote control of two LED indicators through a cloud-based interface. Real-time sensor data is transmitted to Firebase, providing a synchronized platform accessible from multiple devices simultaneously.

Inspired by the chain-of-thought reasoning, where harder problems require longer thinking steps/time, this paper aims to explore a system that can think step-by-step, look up information if needed, generate results, self-evaluate its own results, and refine the results, in the same way humans approach harder questions. We introduce CoT-Seg, a training-free framework that rethinks reasoning segmentation by combining chain-of-thought reasoning with self-correction. Instead of fine-tuning, CoT-Seg leverages the inherent reasoning ability of pre-trained MLLMs (GPT-4o) to decompose queries into meta-instructions, extract fine-grained semantics from images, and identify target objects even under implicit or complex prompts. Moreover, CoT-Seg incorporates a self-correction stage: the model evaluates its own segmentation against the original query and reasoning trace, identifies mismatches, and iteratively refines the mask. This tight integration of reasoning and correction significantly improves reliability and robustness, especially in ambiguous or error-prone cases. Furthermore, our CoT-Seg framework allows easy incorporation of retrieval-augmented reasoning, enabling the system to access external knowledge when the input lacks sufficient information. To showcase CoT-Seg's ability to handle very challenging cases ,we introduce a new dataset ReasonSeg-Hard. Our results highlight that combining chain-of-thought reasoning, self-correction, offers a powerful paradigm for vision-language integration driven segmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "CoT-Seg\uff1a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u81ea\u6211\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3MLLMs\u5206\u89e3\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u63d0\u53d6\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u57df\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u53d7\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u542f\u53d1\uff08\u66f4\u96be\u95ee\u9898\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u957f\u601d\u8003\u6b65\u9aa4\uff09\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u50cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u6837\u9010\u6b65\u601d\u8003\u3001\u67e5\u627e\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCoT-Seg\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3MLLMs\uff08GPT-4o\uff09\u5206\u89e3\u67e5\u8be2\u4e3a\u5143\u6307\u4ee4\uff1b2\uff09\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u53d6\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b3\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u9690\u542b\u6216\u590d\u6742\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\uff1b4\uff09\u81ea\u6211\u6821\u6b63\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5e76\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u63a9\u7801\uff1b5\uff09\u53ef\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u8bbf\u95ee\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6", "result": "\u521b\u5efaReasonSeg-Hard\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c55\u793aCoT-Seg\u5904\u7406\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u81ea\u6211\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u5272\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u6216\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b", "conclusion": "\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u81ea\u6211\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u96c6\u6210\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd"}}

Low contrast, motion, foreshortening, overlap, and catheter confounding degrade segmentation and contribute to domain shift across centers. Reliable segmentation, together with vessel-type labeling, enables vessel-specific coronary analytics and downstream measurements that depend on anatomical localization. From 670 cine sequences (407 subjects), we select a best frame near peak opacification using a low-intensity histogram criterion and apply joint super-resolution and enhancement. We benchmark classical Meijering, Frangi, and Sato vesselness filters under per-image oracle tuning, a single global mean setting, and per-image parameter prediction via Support Vector Regression (SVR). Neural baselines include U-Net, FPN, and a Swin Transformer, trained with coronary-only and merged coronary+catheter supervision. A second stage assigns vessel identity (LAD, LCX, RCA). External evaluation uses the public DCA1 cohort. SVR per-image tuning improves Dice over global means for all classical filters (e.g., Frangi: 0.759 vs. 0.741). Among deep models, FPN attains 0.914+/-0.007 Dice (coronary-only), and merged coronary+catheter labels further improve to 0.931+/-0.006. On DCA1 as a strict external test, Dice drops to 0.798 (coronary-only) and 0.814 (merged), while light in-domain fine-tuning recovers to 0.881+/-0.014 and 0.882+/-0.015.

(1) Cross-scale Gated Fusion (CrGF) adaptively aggregates semantic priors, texture details, and decoder context across hierarchical depths, stabilizing gradient flow and maintaining feature consistency. (2) Layer Fusion-Separation Blocks (LFSB) alternate between fusion for shared structure extraction and differential separation for layer-specific disentanglement. Inspired by Differential Transformer, we extend attention cancellation to dual-stream separation via cross-stream subtraction.

Manuscript prepared for submission to ACM TOMM", "summary": "Accurate brain tumor segmentation from multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a prerequisite for precise radiotherapy planning and surgical navigation. While recent Transformer-based models such as Swin UNETR have achieved impressive benchmark performance, their clinical utility is often compromised by two critical issues: sensitivity to missing modalities (common in clinical practice) and a lack of confidence calibration. Merely chasing higher Dice scores on idealized data fails to meet the safety requirements of real-world medical deployment. In this work, we propose BMDS-Net, a unified framework that prioritizes clinical robustness and trustworthiness over simple metric maximization. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we construct a robust deterministic backbone by integrating a Zero-Init Multimodal Contextual Fusion (MMCF) module and a Residual-Gated Deep Decoder Supervision (DDS) mechanism, enabling stable feature learning and precise boundary delineation with significantly reduced Hausdorff Distance, even under modality corruption. Second, and most importantly, we introduce a memory-efficient Bayesian fine-tuning strategy that transforms the network into a probabilistic predictor, providing voxel-wise uncertainty maps to highlight potential errors for clinicians. Third, comprehensive experiments on the BraTS 2021 dataset demonstrate that BMDS-Net not only maintains competitive accuracy but, more importantly, exhibits superior stability in missing-modality scenarios where baseline models fail.

Intriguingly, images differ in their attackability. Specifically, given an attack configuration, some images are easily corrupted, whereas others are more resistant. Evaluating image attackability has important applications in active learning, adversarial training, and attack enhancement. This prompts a growing interest in developing attackability measures. However, existing methods are scarce and suffer from two major limitations: (1) They rely on a model proxy to provide prior knowledge (e.g., gradients or minimal perturbation) to extract model-dependent image features. Unfortunately, in practice, many task-specific models are not readily accessible. (2) Extracted features characterizing image attackability lack visual interpretability, obscuring their direct relationship with the images. To address these, we propose a novel Object Texture Intensity (OTI), a model-free and visually interpretable measure of image attackability, which measures image attackability as the texture intensity of the image's semantic object.

Although progress has been made in increasing the resolution of these satellite images, many downstream tasks are only interested in small regions of any given image. These areas of interest vary by task but, once known, can be used to optimize how information within the image is encoded. Whereas standard image encoding methods, even those optimized for remote sensing, work on the whole image equally, there are emerging methods that can be guided by saliency maps to focus on important areas. In this work we show how imagery preprocessing techniques driven by saliency maps can be used with traditional lossy compression coding standards to create variable rate image compression within a single large satellite image. Specifically, we use variable sized smoothing kernels that map to different quantized saliency levels to process imagery pixels in order to optimize downstream compression and encoding schemes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u663e\u8457\u56fe\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u901f\u7387\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u6838\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u663e\u8457\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4f20\u7edf\u6709\u635f\u538b\u7f29\u6807\u51c6", "motivation": "\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5de8\u5927\uff08\u6bcf\u5929\u6570\u767eTB\uff09\uff0c\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u8bb8\u591a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5c0f\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6574\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u540c\u7b49\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u4f18\u5316\u7f16\u7801", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u663e\u8457\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u91cf\u5316\u663e\u8457\u7ea7\u522b\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u6838\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u50cf\u7d20\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u4e0b\u6e38\u538b\u7f29\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848", "result": "\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u53d8\u901f\u7387\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u4f7f\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u805a\u7126\u91cd\u8981\u533a\u57df", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u8457\u56fe\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u6709\u635f\u538b\u7f29\u6807\u51c6\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u9700\u6c42\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29"}}

Recent work augments LLMs with external tools to enable agentic reasoning, achieving high utility and efficiency in a plug-and-play manner. However, the inherent vulnerabilities of such methods to malicious manipulation of the tool-calling process remain largely unexplored. In this work, we identify a tool-specific attack surface and propose Sponge Tool Attack (STA), which disrupts agentic reasoning solely by rewriting the input prompt under a strict query-only access assumption. Without any modification on the underlying model or the external tools, STA converts originally concise and efficient reasoning trajectories into unnecessarily verbose and convoluted ones before arriving at the final answer. This results in substantial computational overhead while remaining stealthy by preserving the original task semantics and user intent. To achieve this, we design STA as an iterative, multi-agent collaborative framework with explicit rewritten policy control, and generates benign-looking prompt rewrites from the original one with high semantic fidelity.

Traditional augmentation improves robustness, but fails under substantial domain shifts. Recent advances in stylistic augmentation enhance domain generalization by varying image styles but fall short in terms of style diversity or by introducing artifacts into the generated images. To address these limitations, we propose Stylizing ViT, a novel Vision Transformer encoder that utilizes weight-shared attention blocks for both self- and cross-attention. This design allows the same attention block to maintain anatomical consistency through self-attention while performing style transfer via cross-attention. We assess the effectiveness of our method for domain generalization by employing it for data augmentation on three distinct image classification tasks in the context of histopathology and dermatology. Results demonstrate an improved robustness (up to +13% accuracy) over the state of the art while generating perceptually convincing images without artifacts. Additionally, we show that Stylizing ViT is effective beyond training, achieving a 17% performance improvement during inference when used for test-time augmentation.

Existing methods attempt to bridge this gap by querying CLIP with textual prompts, a process that is often indirect and inefficient. This paper introduces a fundamentally different approach using a dual-pathway decoder. We present SPACE-CLIP, an architecture that unlocks and interprets latent geometric knowledge directly from a frozen CLIP vision encoder, completely bypassing the text encoder and its associated textual prompts. A semantic pathway interprets high-level features, dynamically conditioned on global context using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM). In addition, a structural pathway extracts fine-grained spatial details from early layers. These complementary streams are hierarchically fused, enabling a robust synthesis of semantic context and precise geometry. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that SPACE-CLIP dramatically outperforms previous CLIP-based methods. Our ablation studies validate that the synergistic fusion of our dual pathways is critical to this success. SPACE-CLIP offers a new, efficient, and architecturally elegant blueprint for repurposing large-scale vision models. The proposed method is not just a standalone depth estimator, but a readily integrable spatial perception module for the next generation of embodied AI systems, such as vision-language-action (VLA) models.

However, modern text-to-image diffusion models struggle to generate accurate multi-food images due to object entanglement, where adjacent foods (e.g., rice and soup) fuse together because many foods do not have clear boundaries. To address this challenge, we introduce Prompt Grafting (PG), a training-free framework that combines explicit spatial cues in text with implicit layout guidance during sampling. PG runs a two-stage process where a layout prompt first establishes distinct regions and the target prompt is grafted once layout formation stabilizes. The framework enables food entanglement control: users can specify which food items should remain separated or be intentionally mixed by editing the arrangement of layouts. Across two food datasets, our method significantly improves the presence of target objects and provides qualitative evidence of controllable separation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPrompt Grafting\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5e03\u5c40\u63d0\u793a\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u98df\u7269\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u7ea0\u7f20\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u9910\u98df\u56fe\u50cf\u901a\u5e38\u5305\u542b\u591a\u79cd\u98df\u7269\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u98df\u7269\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u7ea0\u7f20\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u7c73\u996d\u548c\u6c64\u878d\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u996e\u98df\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u98df\u8c31\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7b49\u5e94\u7528", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPrompt Grafting\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u5e03\u5c40\u63d0\u793a\u5efa\u7acb\u4e0d\u540c\u533a\u57df\uff1b2\uff09\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5728\u5e03\u5c40\u7a33\u5b9a\u540e\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u793a\"\u5ac1\u63a5\"\u5230\u76f8\u5e94\u533a\u57df\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u8f91\u5e03\u5c40\u6392\u5217\u63a7\u5236\u54ea\u4e9b\u98df\u7269\u5206\u79bb\u6216\u6df7\u5408", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u98df\u7269\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u63a7\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc1\u636e", "conclusion": "Prompt Grafting\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u98df\u7269\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u7ea0\u7f20\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u98df\u7269\u5206\u79bb\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u996e\u98df\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u5de5\u5177"}}

Motivated by this observation, we propose Uni-RS, the first unified multimodal model tailored for remote sensing, to explicitly address the spatial asymmetry between understanding and generation. Specifically, we first introduce explicit Spatial-Layout Planning to transform textual instructions into spatial layout plans, decoupling geometric planning from visual synthesis.

Finally, we develop Image-Caption Spatial Layout Variation to expose the model to systematic geometry-consistent spatial transformations.

Here, we present an automated deep learning framework that integrates AI-assisted annotation, segmentation, classification, and instance counting to quantify red blood cell (RBC) populations across varying density regimes in time-lapse microscopy data. Experimental images were annotated using the Roboflow platform to generate labeled dataset for training an nnU-Net segmentation model. The trained network enables prediction of the temporal evolution of the sickle cell fraction, while a watershed algorithm resolves overlapping cells to enhance quantification accuracy. Despite requiring only a limited amount of labeled data for training, the framework achieves high segmentation performance, effectively addressing challenges associated with scarce manual annotations and cell overlap. By quantitatively tracking dynamic changes in RBC morphology, this approach can more than double the experimental throughput via densely packed cell suspensions, capture drug-dependent sickling behavior, and reveal distinct mechanobiological signatures of cellular morphological evolution.

Sparse-voxel rasterization provides continuous opacity fields and crisp geometry, but its typical uniform dense-grid initialization slows convergence and underutilizes scene structure. We combine the advantages of both by introducing a voxel initialization method that places voxels at plausible locations and with appropriate levels of detail, yielding a strong starting point for per-scene optimization. To further enhance depth consistency without blurring edges, we propose refined depth geometry supervision that converts multi-view cues into direct per-ray depth regularization.

To date, no empirical study has systematically examined the effectiveness of existing methods, nor investigated the effects of different training recipes, such as scaling laws, objective design, and optimization strategies. A rigorous empirical analysis is essential not only for benchmarking performance and revealing true gains but also for establishing the current state of ASSR, identifying saturation limits, and highlighting promising directions. We fill this gap by comparing existing techniques across diverse settings and presenting aggregated performance results on multiple image quality metrics. We contribute a unified framework and code repository to facilitate reproducible comparisons. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of carefully controlled training configurations on perceptual image quality and examine a new loss function that penalizes intensity variations while preserving edges, textures, and finer details during training. We conclude the following key insights that have been previously overlooked: (1) Recent, more complex INR methods provide only marginal improvements over earlier methods. (2) Model performance is strongly correlated to training configurations, a factor overlooked in prior works.

However, generative modeling of B-Reps remains a formidable challenge due to their inherent heterogeneity as geometric cell complexes, which entangles topology with geometry across cells of varying orders (i.e., $k$-cells such as vertices, edges, faces). Previous methods typically rely on cascaded sequences to handle this hierarchy, which fails to fully exploit the geometric relationships between cells, such as adjacency and sharing, limiting context awareness and error recovery. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel paradigm that reformulates B-Reps into sets of compositional $k$-cell particles. Our approach encodes each topological entity as a composition of particles, where adjacent cells share identical latents at their interfaces, thereby promoting geometric coupling along shared boundaries. By decoupling the rigid hierarchy, our representation unifies vertices, edges, and faces, enabling the joint generation of topology and geometry with global context awareness.\n  We synthesize these particle sets using a multi-modal flow matching framework to handle unconditional generation as well as precise conditional tasks, such as 3D reconstruction from single-view or point cloud. Furthermore, the explicit and localized nature of our representation naturally extends to downstream tasks like local in-painting and enables the direct synthesis of non-manifold structures (e.g., wireframes).

However, these models struggle to generate long-form, coherent narratives from high-level concepts like dialogue, revealing a ``semantic gap'' between a creative idea and its cinematic execution. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel, end-to-end agentic framework for dialogue-to-cinematic-video generation. Central to our framework is ScripterAgent, a model trained to translate coarse dialogue into a fine-grained, executable cinematic script. To enable this, we construct ScriptBench, a new large-scale benchmark with rich multimodal context, annotated via an expert-guided pipeline. The generated script then guides DirectorAgent, which orchestrates state-of-the-art video models using a cross-scene continuous generation strategy to ensure long-horizon coherence. Our comprehensive evaluation, featuring an AI-powered CriticAgent and a new Visual-Script Alignment (VSA) metric, shows our framework significantly improves script faithfulness and temporal fidelity across all tested video models.

Despite progress in automated pattern generation, accurately modeling sewing patterns remains difficult due to the broad variability in panel geometry and seam arrangements. In this work, we introduce a sewing pattern modeling method based on an implicit representation. We represent each panel using a signed distance field that defines its boundary and an unsigned distance field that identifies seam endpoints, and encode these fields into a continuous latent space that enables differentiable meshing. A latent flow matching model learns distributions over panel combinations in this representation, and a stitching prediction module recovers seam relations from extracted edge segments. This formulation allows accurate modeling and generation of sewing patterns with complex structures. We further show that it can be used to estimate sewing patterns from images with improved accuracy relative to existing approaches, and supports applications such as pattern completion and refitting, providing a practical tool for digital fashion design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7f1d\u7eab\u56fe\u6848\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7b26\u53f7\u8ddd\u79bb\u573a\u8868\u793a\u9762\u677f\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u65e0\u7b26\u53f7\u8ddd\u79bb\u573a\u8868\u793a\u7f1d\u7ebf\u7aef\u70b9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7f51\u683c\u5316\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u56fe\u6848\u751f\u6210\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u56fe\u6848\u7f16\u8f91\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f1d\u7eab\u56fe\u6848\u662f\u670d\u88c5\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5bf9\u65f6\u5c1a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5236\u4f5c\u548c\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u56fe\u6848\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u9762\u677f\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u7f1d\u7ebf\u6392\u5217\u53d8\u5316\u5f88\u5927\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u7b26\u53f7\u8ddd\u79bb\u573a\u8868\u793a\u9762\u677f\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u65e0\u7b26\u53f7\u8ddd\u79bb\u573a\u8868\u793a\u7f1d\u7ebf\u7aef\u70b9\uff1b2. \u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u573a\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7f51\u683c\u5316\uff1b3. \u4f7f\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u677f\u7ec4\u5408\u5206\u5e03\uff1b4. \u901a\u8fc7\u7f1d\u7ebf\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u4ece\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u6bb5\u6062\u590d\u7f1d\u7ebf\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u751f\u6210\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7f1d\u7eab\u56fe\u6848\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u7f1d\u7eab\u56fe\u6848\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u56fe\u6848\u8865\u5168\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u62df\u5408\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u65f6\u5c1a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u7f1d\u7eab\u56fe\u6848\u5efa\u6a21\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

INRs offer compact storage and flexible reconstruction, providing a promising alternative to traditional codecs. However, most existing INR-based methods treat the temporal dimension as an independent input, limiting their ability to capture complex temporal dependencies. To address this, we propose a Hierarchical Temporal Neural Representation for Videos, TeNeRV. TeNeRV integrates short- and long-term dependencies through two key components. First, an Inter-Frame Feature Fusion (IFF) module aggregates features from adjacent frames, enforcing local temporal coherence and capturing fine-grained motion.

In real-world scenarios, Pixel-level change labels are expensive to acquire, and existing models struggle to adapt to scenarios with diverse annotation availability. To tackle this challenge, we propose a unified change detection framework (UniCD), which collaboratively handles supervised, weakly-supervised, and unsupervised tasks through a coupled architecture. UniCD eliminates architectural barriers through a shared encoder and multi-branch collaborative learning mechanism, achieving deep coupling of heterogeneous supervision signals. Specifically, UniCD consists of three supervision-specific branches. In the supervision branch, UniCD introduces the spatial-temporal awareness module (STAM), achieving efficient synergistic fusion of bi-temporal features. In the weakly-supervised branch, we construct change representation regularization (CRR), which steers model convergence from coarse-grained activations toward coherent and separable change modeling. In the unsupervised branch, we propose semantic prior-driven change inference (SPCI), which transforms unsupervised tasks into controlled weakly-supervised path optimization. Experiments on mainstream datasets demonstrate that UniCD achieves optimal performance across three tasks.

This limitation renders the S2V task reducible to an S2I + I2V pipeline, failing to exploit the full potential of video subject control. In this work, we propose and address the challenging Multi-View S2V (MV-S2V) task, which synthesizes videos from multiple reference views to enforce 3D-level subject consistency. Regarding the scarcity of training data, we first develop a synthetic data curation pipeline to generate highly customized synthetic data, complemented by a small-scale real-world captured dataset to boost the training of MV-S2V. Another key issue lies in the potential confusion between cross-subject and cross-view references in conditional generation. To overcome this, we further introduce Temporally Shifted RoPE (TS-RoPE) to distinguish between different subjects and distinct views of the same subject in reference conditioning. Our framework achieves superior 3D subject consistency w.r.t. multi-view reference images and high-quality visual outputs, establishing a new meaningful direction for subject-driven video generation.

Traditional methods, such as manual weighing using a walk-over weighing system or proximate measurements using body condition scoring, involve manual handling of stock and can impact productivity from both a stock and economic perspective. To address these issues, this study investigated a cost-effective, non-contact method for live weight calculation in cattle using 3D reconstruction. The proposed pipeline utilized multi-view RGB images with SAM 3D-based agreement-guided fusion, followed by ensemble regression. Our approach generates a single 3D point cloud per animal and compares classical ensemble models with deep learning models under low-data conditions. Results show that SAM 3D with multi-view agreement fusion outperforms other 3D generation methods, while classical ensemble models provide the most consistent performance for practical farm scenarios (R$^2$ = 0.69 $\\pm$ 0.10, MAPE = 2.22 $\\pm$ 0.56 \\%), making this practical for on-farm implementation. These findings demonstrate that improving reconstruction quality is more critical than increasing model complexity for scalable deployment on farms where producing a large volume of 3D data is challenging.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u89c6\u89d2RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u548cSAM 3D\u91cd\u5efa\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u96c6\u6210\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u5f0f\u3001\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u7684\u725b\u53ea\u6d3b\u91cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u519c\u573a\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u725b\u53ea\u6d3b\u91cd\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u624b\u52a8\u79f0\u91cd\u6216\u4f53\u51b5\u8bc4\u5206\uff09\u9700\u8981\u4eba\u5de5\u5904\u7406\u7272\u755c\uff0c\u65e2\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u4ea7\u6548\u7387\u53c8\u589e\u52a0\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6210\u672c\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u5f0f\u3001\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u7ba1\u9053\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528SAM 3D\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u878d\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5355\u4e2a\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6bd4\u8f83\u7ecf\u5178\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "SAM 3D\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed63D\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u519c\u573a\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u7a33\u5b9a\uff08R\u00b2 = 0.69 \u00b1 0.10\uff0cMAPE = 2.22 \u00b1 0.56%\uff09\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u519c\u573a\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u519c\u573a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad83D\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a213D\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u519c\u573a\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To effectively reduce this cost, researchers have proposed various visual token pruning methods. However, existing methods are generally limited, either losing critical visual information prematurely due to pruning in the vision encoder, or leading to information redundancy among the selected tokens due to pruning in the Large Language Models (LLMs). To address these challenges, we propose a Visual and Textual Semantic Collaborative Pruning framework (ViTCoP) that combines redundancy filtering in the vision encoder with step-wise co-pruning within the LLM based on its hierarchical characteristics, to efficiently preserve critical and informationally diverse visual tokens. Meanwhile, to ensure compatibility with acceleration techniques like FlashAttention, we introduce the L2 norm of K-vectors as the token saliency metric in the LLM. Extensive experiments on various Large Vision-Language Models demonstrate that ViTCoP not only achieves state-of-the-art performance surpassing existing methods on both image and video understanding tasks, but also significantly reduces model inference latency and GPU memory consumption.

Yet, a persistent limitation remains: while reconstructed images often appear naturalistic and holistically similar to the target stimuli, they frequently suffer from severe semantic misalignment -- salient objects are often replaced or hallucinated despite high visual quality. In this work, we address this limitation by rethinking the role of explicit semantic interpretation in fMRI decoding. We argue that existing methods rely too heavily on entangled visual embeddings which prioritize low-level appearance cues -- such as texture and global gist -- over explicit semantic identity. To overcome this, we parse fMRI signals into rich, sentence-level semantic descriptions that mirror the hierarchical and compositional nature of human visual understanding. We achieve this by leveraging grounded VLMs to generate synthetic, human-like, multi-granularity textual representations that capture object identities and spatial organization. Built upon this foundation, we propose SynMind, a framework that integrates these explicit semantic encodings with visual priors to condition a pretrained diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SynMind outperforms state-of-the-art methods across most quantitative metrics. Notably, by offloading semantic reasoning to our text-alignment module, SynMind surpasses competing methods based on SDXL while using the much smaller Stable Diffusion 1.4 and a single consumer GPU. Large-scale human evaluations further confirm that SynMind produces reconstructions more consistent with human visual perception.

To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight domain generalization framework with quantum-enhanced collaborative learning, enabling robust generalization to unseen target domains without relying on real multi-center labeled data. Specifically, a MobileNetV2-based domain-invariant encoder is constructed and optimized through three key components: (1) multi-domain imaging shift simulation using brightness, contrast, sharpening, and noise perturbations to emulate heterogeneous acquisition conditions; (2) domain-adversarial training with gradient reversal to suppress domain-discriminative features; and (3) a lightweight quantum feature enhancement layer that applies parameterized quantum circuits for nonlinear feature mapping and entanglement modeling. In addition, a test-time adaptation strategy is employed during inference to further alleviate distribution shifts. Experiments on simulated multi-center medical imaging datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms baseline models without domain generalization or quantum enhancement on unseen domains, achieving reduced domain-specific performance variance and improved AUC and sensitivity.

Recent advances, exemplified by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have extended this paradigm to videos and multi-view images. However, the lack of 3D awareness often leads to inconsistent results, necessitating costly per-scene optimization to enforce 3D consistency. In this work, we introduce MV-SAM, a framework for multi-view segmentation that achieves 3D consistency using pointmaps -- 3D points reconstructed from unposed images by recent visual geometry models. Leveraging the pixel-point one-to-one correspondence of pointmaps, MV-SAM lifts images and prompts into 3D space, eliminating the need for explicit 3D networks or annotated 3D data. Specifically, MV-SAM extends SAM by lifting image embeddings from its pretrained encoder into 3D point embeddings, which are decoded by a transformer using cross-attention with 3D prompt embeddings. This design aligns 2D interactions with 3D geometry, enabling the model to implicitly learn consistent masks across views through 3D positional embeddings. Trained on the SA-1B dataset, our method generalizes well across domains, outperforming SAM2-Video and achieving comparable performance with per-scene optimization baselines on NVOS, SPIn-NeRF, ScanNet++, uCo3D, and DL3DV benchmarks.

Existing vision-language-action models often fail to generalize because (i) multi-view features are fused via view-agnostic token concatenation, yielding weak 3D-consistent spatial understanding, and (ii) language is injected as global conditioning, resulting in coarse instruction grounding.\n  In this paper, we introduce PEAfowl, a perception-enhanced multi-view VLA policy for bimanual manipulation. For spatial reasoning, PEAfowl predicts per-token depth distributions, performs differentiable 3D lifting, and aggregates local cross-view neighbors to form geometrically grounded, cross-view consistent representations. For instruction grounding, we propose to replace global conditioning with a Perceiver-style text-aware readout over frozen CLIP visual features, enabling iterative evidence accumulation. To overcome noisy and incomplete commodity depth without adding inference overhead, we apply training-only depth distillation from a pretrained depth teacher to supervise the depth-distribution head, providing perception front-end with geometry-aware priors.\n  On RoboTwin 2.0 under domain-randomized setting, PEAfowl improves the strongest baseline by 23.0 pp in success rate, and real-robot experiments further demonstrate reliable sim-to-real transfer and consistent improvements from depth distillation.\n  Project website: https://peafowlvla.github.io/.", "AI": {"tldr": "PEAfowl\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u53cc\u624b\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u76843D\u8868\u793a\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u8bfb\u53d6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u6742\u4e71\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53cc\u624b\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1) \u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u7279\u5f81\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89d2\u65e0\u5173\u7684token\u62fc\u63a5\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f43D\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\uff1b2) \u8bed\u8a00\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u6761\u4ef6\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6307\u4ee4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7c97\u7cd9\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u906e\u6321\u3001\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u573a\u666f\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1) \u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff1a\u9884\u6d4b\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u5fae3D\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u90bb\u5c45\u5f62\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff1b2) \u6307\u4ee4\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff1a\u7528Perceiver\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u6587\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u8bfb\u53d6\u673a\u5236\u66ff\u4ee3\u5168\u5c40\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684CLIP\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bc1\u636e\u79ef\u7d2f\uff1b3) \u6df1\u5ea6\u84b8\u998f\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df1\u5ea6\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u4e3a\u611f\u77e5\u524d\u7aef\u63d0\u4f9b\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5728RoboTwin 2.0\u7684\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cPEAfowl\u6bd4\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347\u4e8623.0\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6df1\u5ea6\u84b8\u998f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "PEAfowl\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u76843D\u8868\u793a\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u8bfb\u53d6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53cc\u624b\u64cd\u4f5c\u5728\u6742\u4e71\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Capturing pixel-aligned metric depth using RGB-D cameras would be the most viable way, yet it usually faces obstacles posed by hardware limitations and challenging imaging conditions, especially in the presence of specular or texture-less surfaces. In this work, we argue that the inaccuracies from depth sensors can be viewed as \"masked\" signals that inherently reflect underlying geometric ambiguities. Building on this motivation, we present LingBot-Depth, a depth completion model which leverages visual context to refine depth maps through masked depth modeling and incorporates an automated data curation pipeline for scalable training.

In this paper, we revisit 3D reconstruction from the perspective of signal processing, identifying the periodic spectral extension induced by discrete sampling as the fundamental challenge. Previous 3D reconstruction kernels, such as Gaussians, Exponential functions, and Student's t distributions, serve as the low pass filters to isolate the baseband spectrum. However, their unideal low-pass property results in the overlap of high-frequency components with low-frequency components in the discrete-time signal's spectrum. To this end, we introduce Jinc kernel with an instantaneous drop to zero magnitude exactly at the cutoff frequency, which is corresponding to the ideal low pass filters. As Jinc kernel suffers from low decay speed in the spatial domain, we further propose modulated kernels to strick an effective balance, and achieves superior rendering performance by reconciling spatial efficiency and frequency-domain fidelity.

This makes generalization to novel classes particularly difficult. We propose a novel approach predicated on the hypothesis that base and novel class embeddings have structural similarity. We map the original embedding space into a residual space by subtracting the class prototype (i.e., the average class embedding) of input samples. Then, we leverage generative modeling with VAE or diffusion models to learn the multi-modal distribution of residuals over the base classes, and we use this as a valuable structural prior to improve recognition of novel classes.

While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a potent framework for refining model responses, its efficacy in high-stakes medical contexts remains underexplored, lacking the rigorous empirical groundwork necessary to guide future methodological advances. To bridge this gap, we present the first comprehensive examination of diverse DPO variants within the medical domain, evaluating nine distinct formulations across two medical LVLMs: LLaVA-Med and HuatuoGPT-Vision. Our results reveal several critical limitations: current DPO approaches often yield inconsistent gains over supervised fine-tuning, with their efficacy varying significantly across different tasks and backbones. Furthermore, they frequently fail to resolve fundamental visual misinterpretation errors. Building on these insights, we present a targeted preference construction strategy as a proof-of-concept that explicitly addresses visual misinterpretation errors frequently observed in existing DPO models. This design yields a 3.6% improvement over the strongest existing DPO baseline on visual question-answering tasks.

The RemEdit diffusion-based framework addresses this trade-off with two synergistic innovations. First, for editing fidelity, we navigate the latent space as a Riemannian manifold. A mamba-based module efficiently learns the manifold's structure, enabling direct and accurate geodesic path computation for smooth semantic edits. This control is further refined by a dual-SLERP blending technique and a goal-aware prompt enrichment pass from a Vision-Language Model. Second, for additional acceleration, we introduce a novel task-specific attention pruning mechanism. A lightweight pruning head learns to retain tokens essential to the edit, enabling effective optimization without the semantic degradation common in content-agnostic approaches. RemEdit surpasses prior state-of-the-art editing frameworks while maintaining real-time performance under 50% pruning. Consequently, RemEdit establishes a new benchmark for practical and powerful image editing.

We introduce SC-SAM, a specialist-generalist framework where U-Net provides point-based prompts and pseudo-labels to guide SAM's adaptation, while SAM serves as a powerful generalist supervisor to regularize U-Net. This reciprocal guidance forms a bidirectional co-training loop that allows both models to effectively exploit the unlabeled data. Across prostate MRI and polyp segmentation benchmarks, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming other existing semi-supervised SAM variants and even medical foundation models like MedSAM, highlighting the value of specialist-generalist cooperation for label-efficient medical image segmentation.

Conventional upsampling methods, such as transposed convolution and linear interpolation, operate on fixed positions: transposed convolution applies kernel elements to predetermined pixel or voxel locations, while linear interpolation assigns values based on fixed coordinates in the original feature map. These fixed-position approaches may fail to capture structural information beyond predefined sampling positions and can lead to artifacts or loss of detail. Inspired by deformable convolutions, we propose a novel upsampling method, Deformable Transposed Convolution (DTC), which learns dynamic coordinates (i.e., sampling positions) to generate high-resolution feature maps for both 2D and 3D medical image segmentation tasks. Experiments on 3D (e.g., BTCV15) and 2D datasets (e.g., ISIC18, BUSI) demonstrate that DTC can be effectively integrated into existing medical image segmentation models, consistently improving the decoder's feature reconstruction and detail recovery capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u8f6c\u7f6e\u5377\u79ef\uff08DTC\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u8f6c\u7f6e\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u63d2\u503c\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u91c7\u6837\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f2a\u5f71\u6216\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\u3002\u53d7\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u5377\u79ef\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u8f6c\u7f6e\u5377\u79ef\uff08DTC\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u5750\u6807\uff08\u91c7\u6837\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff09\u6765\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e2D\u548c3D\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u57283D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5982BTCV15\uff09\u548c2D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5982ISIC18\u3001BUSI\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDTC\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "DTC\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

However, existing pipelines rely on supervised segmentation or hand-crafted kymographs and rarely encode the laminar Stokes-flow physics that governs RBC shape evolution. We introduce FlowMorph, a physics-consistent self-supervised framework that learns a label-free scalar mechanics proxy $k$ for each tracked RBC from short brightfield microfluidic videos. FlowMorph models each cell by a low-dimensional parametric contour, advances boundary points through a differentiable ''capsule-in-flow'' combining laminar advection and curvature-regularized elastic relaxation, and optimizes a loss coupling silhouette overlap, intra-cellular flow agreement, area conservation, wall constraints, and temporal smoothness, using only automatically derived silhouettes and optical flow.\n  Across four public RBC microfluidic datasets, FlowMorph achieves a mean silhouette IoU of $0.905$ on physics-rich videos with provided velocity fields and markedly improves area conservation and wall violations over purely data-driven baselines. On $\\sim 1.5\\times 10^5$ centered sequences, the scalar $k$ alone separates tank-treading from flipping dynamics with an AUC of $0.863$. Using only $200$ real-time deformability cytometry (RT-DC) events for calibration, a monotone map $E=g(k)$ predicts apparent Young's modulus with a mean absolute error of $0.118$\\,MPa on $600$ held-out cells and degrades gracefully under shifts in channel geometry, optics, and frame rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlowMorph\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u7ea2\u7ec6\u80de\u5728\u5fae\u6d41\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u529b\u5b66\u4ee3\u7406\u53c2\u6570k\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ea2\u7ec6\u80de\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ea2\u7ec6\u80de\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u662f\u8840\u6db2\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5fae\u6d41\u63a7\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u5272\u6216\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7ed3\u5408\u5c42\u6d41\u65af\u6258\u514b\u65af\u6d41\u52a8\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u3002", "method": "FlowMorph\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u7ef4\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8f6e\u5ed3\u5efa\u6a21\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ec6\u80de\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\"\u6d41\u4e2d\u80f6\u56ca\"\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u5c42\u6d41\u5e73\u6d41\u548c\u66f2\u7387\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f39\u6027\u677e\u5f1b\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8026\u5408\u8f6e\u5ed3\u91cd\u53e0\u3001\u7ec6\u80de\u5185\u6d41\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u9762\u79ef\u5b88\u6052\u3001\u58c1\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00RBC\u5fae\u6d41\u63a7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cFlowMorph\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u5747\u8f6e\u5ed3IoU 0.905\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u9762\u79ef\u5b88\u6052\u548c\u58c1\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u3002\u529b\u5b66\u4ee3\u7406\u53c2\u6570k\u80fd\u4ee5AUC 0.863\u533a\u5206\u7ffb\u8f6c\u548c\u5766\u514b\u5c65\u5e26\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700200\u4e2aRT-DC\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6821\u51c6\u5373\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u8868\u89c2\u6768\u6c0f\u6a21\u91cf\uff0cMAE\u4e3a0.118 MPa\u3002", "conclusion": "FlowMorph\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5fae\u6d41\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7ea2\u7ec6\u80de\u529b\u5b66\u4ee3\u7406\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u7ec6\u80de\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

These methods act as a shortcut to achieve dense features for a fraction of the cost by learning to map low-resolution features to high-resolution versions. While early works in this space used iterative upsampling approaches, more recent works have switched to cross-attention-based methods, which risk falling into the same efficiency scaling problems of the backbones they are upsampling. In this work, we demonstrate that iterative upsampling methods can still compete with cross-attention-based methods; moreover, they can achieve state-of-the-art performance with lower inference costs. We propose UPLiFT, an architecture for Universal Pixel-dense Lightweight Feature Transforms. We also propose an efficient Local Attender operator to overcome the limitations of prior iterative feature upsampling methods. This operator uses an alternative attentional pooling formulation defined fully locally. We show that our Local Attender allows UPLiFT to maintain stable features throughout upsampling, enabling state-of-the-art performance with lower inference costs than existing pixel-dense feature upsamplers. In addition, we apply UPLiFT to generative downstream tasks and show that it achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art Coupled Flow Matching models for VAE feature upsampling.

In contrast, clinical practice offers rich expert knowledge, such as physician gaze patterns and diagnostic heuristics, that models cannot reliably learn from limited data. Combining data-driven experts, which capture novel patterns, with domain-expert-guided experts, which encode accumulated clinical insights, provides complementary strengths for robust and clinically meaningful learning. To this end, we propose Domain-Knowledge-Guided Hybrid MoE (DKGH-MoE), a plug-and-play and interpretable module that unifies data-driven learning with domain expertise. DKGH-MoE integrates a data-driven MoE to extract novel features from raw imaging data, and a domain-expert-guided MoE incorporates clinical priors, specifically clinician eye-gaze cues, to emphasize regions of high diagnostic relevance.

While deep learning models have shown strong performance in automating parasite detection, their clinical usefulness is constrained by limited interpretability. Existing explainability methods are largely restricted to visual heatmaps or attention maps, which highlight regions of interest but fail to capture the morphological traits that clinicians rely on for diagnosis. In this work, we present MorphXAI, an explainable framework that unifies parasite detection with fine-grained morphological analysis. MorphXAI integrates morphological supervision directly into the prediction pipeline, enabling the model to localize parasites while simultaneously characterizing clinically relevant attributes such as shape, curvature, visible dot count, flagellum presence, and developmental stage. To support this task, we curate a clinician-annotated dataset of three parasite species (Leishmania, Trypanosoma brucei, and Trypanosoma cruzi) with detailed morphological labels, establishing a new benchmark for interpretable parasite analysis.

Multispectral modalities (visible light and thermal) can boost pedestrian detection performance by providing complementary visual information. Several gaps remain with multispectral pedestrian detection methods. First, existing approaches primarily focus on spatial fusion and often neglect temporal information. Second, RGB and thermal image pairs in multispectral benchmarks may not always be perfectly aligned. Pedestrians are also challenging to detect due to varying lighting conditions, occlusion, etc. This work proposes Strip-Fusion, a spatial-temporal fusion network that is robust to misalignment in input images, as well as varying lighting conditions and heavy occlusions. The Strip-Fusion pipeline integrates temporally adaptive convolutions to dynamically weigh spatial-temporal features, enabling our model to better capture pedestrian motion and context over time. A novel Kullback-Leibler divergence loss was designed to mitigate modality imbalance between visible and thermal inputs, guiding feature alignment toward the more informative modality during training. Furthermore, a novel post-processing algorithm was developed to reduce false positives.

Integrating topological properties, such as connectivity, improves segmentation accuracy and consistency. However, extracting and embedding such properties - especially from Persistence Diagrams (PD) - is challenging due to their non-differentiability and computational cost. Existing approaches mostly encode topology through handcrafted loss functions, which generalize poorly across tasks. In this paper, we propose PIs-Regressor, a simple yet effective module that learns persistence image (PI) - finite, differentiable representations of topological features - directly from data. Together with Topology SegNet, which fuses these features in both downsampling and upsampling stages, our framework integrates topology into the network architecture itself rather than auxiliary losses. Unlike existing methods that depend heavily on handcrafted loss functions, our approach directly incorporates topological information into the network structure, leading to more robust segmentation.

However, due to high annotation costs and limited sample availability, semi-supervised learning still faces challenges such as boundary label diffusion and pseudo-label instability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised hyperspectral classification framework integrating spatial prior information with a dynamic learning mechanism. First, we design an Edge-Aware Superpixel Label Propagation (EASLP) module. By integrating edge intensity penalty with neighborhood correction strategy, it mitigates label diffusion from superpixel segmentation while enhancing classification robustness in boundary regions. Second, we introduce a Dynamic History-Fused Prediction (DHP) method. By maintaining historical predictions and dynamically weighting them with current results, DHP smoothens pseudo-label fluctuations and improves temporal consistency and noise resistance. Concurrently, incorporating condifence and consistency measures, the Adaptive Tripartite Sample Categorization (ATSC) strategy implements hierarchical utilization of easy, ambiguous, and hard samples, leading to enhanced pseudo-label quality and learning efficiency. The Dynamic Reliability-Enhanced Pseudo-Label Framework (DREPL), composed of DHP and ATSC, strengthens pseudo-label stability across temporal and sample domains. Through synergizes operation with EASLP, it achieves spatio-temporal consistency optimization. Evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate its capability to maintain superior classification performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fb9\u7f18\u611f\u77e5\u8d85\u50cf\u7d20\u6807\u7b7e\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5386\u53f2\u878d\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8fb9\u754c\u6807\u7b7e\u6269\u6563\u548c\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u6807\u7b7e\u6269\u6563\u548c\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "1) \u8fb9\u7f18\u611f\u77e5\u8d85\u50cf\u7d20\u6807\u7b7e\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u5f3a\u5ea6\u60e9\u7f5a\u548c\u90bb\u57df\u6821\u6b63\u7b56\u7565\uff1b2) \u52a8\u6001\u5386\u53f2\u878d\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u7ef4\u62a4\u5386\u53f2\u9884\u6d4b\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\uff1b3) \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e09\u65b9\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5c42\u5229\u7528\uff1b4) \u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u6574\u5408\u4e0a\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u6807\u7b7e\u6269\u6563\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing methods, however, still rely on source domain annotations and are susceptible to distribution shifts, leading to degraded generalization performance in the target domain. To address this, this paper proposes a self-supervised cross-domain transfer framework that learns transferable spectral-spatial joint representations without source labels and achieves efficient adaptation under few samples in the target domain. During the self-supervised pre-training phase, a Spatial-Spectral Transformer (S2Former) module is designed. It adopts a dual-branch spatial-spectral transformer and introduces a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to achieve spectral-spatial collaborative modeling: the spatial branch enhances structural awareness through random masking, while the spectral branch captures fine-grained differences. Both branches mutually guide each other to improve semantic consistency. We further propose a Frequency Domain Constraint (FDC) to maintain frequency-domain consistency through real Fast Fourier Transform (rFFT) and high-frequency magnitude loss, thereby enhancing the model's capability to discern fine details and boundaries. During the fine-tuning phase, we introduce a Diffusion-Aligned Fine-tuning (DAFT) distillation mechanism.

However, the shrinking operation loses the visual features of text margins and confuses the foreground and background difference, which brings intrinsic limitations to recognize text features. We follow this issue and design Text-Pass Filter (TPF) for arbitrary-shaped text detection. It segments the whole text directly, which avoids the intrinsic limitations. It is noteworthy that different from previous whole text region-based methods, TPF can separate adhesive texts naturally without complex decoding or post-processing processes, which makes it possible for real-time text detection. Concretely, we find that the band-pass filter allows through components in a specified band of frequencies, called its passband but blocks components with frequencies above or below this band. It provides a natural idea for extracting whole texts separately. By simulating the band-pass filter, TPF constructs a unique feature-filter pair for each text. In the inference stage, every filter extracts the corresponding matched text by passing its pass-feature and blocking other features. Meanwhile, considering the large aspect ratio problem of ribbon-like texts makes it hard to recognize texts wholly, a Reinforcement Ensemble Unit (REU) is designed to enhance the feature consistency of the same text and to enlarge the filter's recognition field to help recognize whole texts. Furthermore, a Foreground Prior Unit (FPU) is introduced to encourage TPF to discriminate the difference between the foreground and background, which improves the feature-filter pair quality. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of REU and FPU while showing the TPF's superiority.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faText-Pass Filter (TPF)\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u5f62\u72b6\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u5e26\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u6784\u5efa\u7279\u5f81-\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5bf9\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u6536\u7f29-\u6269\u5f20\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u81ea\u7136\u5206\u79bb\u7c98\u8fde\u6587\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6536\u7f29-\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u5f20\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6536\u7f29\u64cd\u4f5c\u65f6\u4f1a\u4e22\u5931\u6587\u672c\u8fb9\u7f18\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6df7\u6dc6\u524d\u666f\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8fd9\u7ed9\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u8bc6\u522b\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faText-Pass Filter (TPF)\uff1a1) \u6a21\u62df\u5e26\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u6784\u5efa\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u7279\u5f81-\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5bf9\uff1b2) \u8bbe\u8ba1Reinforcement Ensemble Unit (REU)\u589e\u5f3a\u540c\u4e00\u6587\u672c\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e76\u6269\u5927\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u8303\u56f4\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165Foreground Prior Unit (FPU)\u63d0\u5347\u524d\u666f\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86REU\u548cFPU\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86TPF\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u7136\u5206\u79bb\u7c98\u8fde\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u6216\u540e\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "TPF\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5206\u5272\u6574\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u533a\u57df\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u610f\u5f62\u72b6\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u7136\u5206\u79bb\u7c98\u8fde\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although recent vision-language models perform well on image and short-video reasoning, their spatial reasoning capability in long egocentric sequences remains limited. In this work, we study how explicit spatial signals influence VLM-based video understanding without modifying model architectures or inference procedures. We introduce Sanpo-D, a fine-grained re-annotation of the Google Sanpo dataset, and benchmark multiple VLMs on navigation-oriented spatial queries. To examine input-level inductive bias, we further fuse depth maps with RGB frames and evaluate their impact on spatial reasoning.

Moreover, major symptoms of lung cancer are hard to differentiate with other respiratory disease symptoms such as COPD, further leading patients to overlook cancer progression in early stages. Thus, to enhance survival rates in lung cancer, early detection from consistent proactive respiratory system monitoring becomes crucial. One of the most prevalent and effective methods for lung cancer monitoring would be low-dose computed tomography(LDCT) chest scans, which led to remarkable enhancements in lung cancer detection or tumor classification tasks under rapid advancements and applications of computer vision based AI models such as EfficientNet or ResNet in image processing. However, though advanced CNN models under transfer learning or ViT based models led to high performing lung cancer detections, due to its intrinsic limitations in terms of correlation dependence and low interpretability due to complexity, expansions of deep learning models to lung cancer treatment analysis or causal intervention analysis simulations are still limited. Therefore, this research introduced LungCRCT: a latent causal representation learning based lung cancer analysis framework that retrieves causal representations of factors within the physical causal mechanism of lung cancer progression. With the use of advanced graph autoencoder based causal discovery algorithms with distance Correlation disentanglement and entropy-based image reconstruction refinement, LungCRCT not only enables causal intervention analysis for lung cancer treatments, but also leads to robust, yet extremely light downstream models in malignant tumor classification tasks with an AUC score of 93.91%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLungCRCT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u80ba\u764c\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u7269\u7406\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u80ba\u764c\u65e9\u671f\u75c7\u72b6\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\u4e14\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u547c\u5438\u7cfb\u7edf\u75be\u75c5\u75c7\u72b6\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u60a3\u8005\u5ffd\u89c6\u65e9\u671f\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eCNN\u6216ViT\u7684AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u80ba\u764c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7b49\u5185\u5728\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u80ba\u764c\u6cbb\u7597\u5206\u6790\u6216\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u62df", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLungCRCT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8ddd\u79bb\u76f8\u5173\u89e3\u7f20\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u80ba\u764c\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u7269\u7406\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u80ba\u764c\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u6076\u6027\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8693.91%\u7684AUC\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u6781\u8f7b\u91cf\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u6a21\u578b", "conclusion": "LungCRCT\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u80ba\u764c\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u80ba\u764c\u6cbb\u7597\u5206\u6790\u548c\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5"}}

However, most existing VAD methods rely on large-scale models to pursue extreme accuracy, limiting their feasibility on resource-limited edge devices. Moreover, mainstream prediction-based VAD detects anomalies using only single-frame future prediction errors, overlooking the richer constraints from longer-term temporal forward information. In this paper, we introduce FoGA, a lightweight VAD model that performs Forward consistency learning with Gated context Aggregation, containing about 2M parameters and tailored for potential edge devices. Specifically, we propose a Unet-based method that performs feature extraction on consecutive frames to generate both immediate and forward predictions. Then, we introduce a gated context aggregation module into the skip connections to dynamically fuse encoder and decoder features at the same spatial scale. Finally, the model is jointly optimized with a novel forward consistency loss, and a hybrid anomaly measurement strategy is adopted to integrate errors from both immediate and forward frames for more accurate detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods, running up to 155 FPS. Hence, our FoGA achieves an excellent trade-off between performance and the efficiency metric.", "AI": {"tldr": "FoGA\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u5411\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u95e8\u63a7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u7ea6200\u4e07\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u8fbe155 FPS\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u8ffd\u6c42\u6781\u81f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3b\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u5e27\u672a\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u66f4\u957f\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u524d\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eUnet\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\u5e27\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5373\u65f6\u548c\u524d\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u5728\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u95e8\u63a7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u524d\u5411\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u5f02\u5e38\u6d4b\u91cf\u7b56\u7565\u6574\u5408\u5373\u65f6\u548c\u524d\u5411\u5e27\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u9ad8\u8fbe155 FPS\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u6307\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u79c0\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "FoGA\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u524d\u5411\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u826f\u597d\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

Achieving this vision requires advances in long-horizon video understanding, where systems must interpret and recall visual and audio information spanning days or even weeks. Existing methods, including large language models and retrieval-augmented generation, are constrained by limited context windows and lack the ability to perform compositional, multi-hop reasoning over very long video streams. In this work, we address these challenges through EGAgent, an enhanced agentic framework centered on entity scene graphs, which represent people, places, objects, and their relationships over time. Our system equips a planning agent with tools for structured search and reasoning over these graphs, as well as hybrid visual and audio search capabilities, enabling detailed, cross-modal, and temporally coherent reasoning. Experiments on the EgoLifeQA and Video-MME (Long) datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on EgoLifeQA (57.5%) and competitive performance on Video-MME (Long) (74.1%) for complex longitudinal video understanding tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "EGAgent\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fde\u7eed\u7eb5\u5411\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u5929\u5019\u4e2a\u4ebaAI\u52a9\u624b\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u77ed\u671f\u5b64\u7acb\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u7eb5\u5411\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEGAgent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u8868\u793a\u4eba\u7269\u3001\u5730\u70b9\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u53ca\u5176\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c4\u5212\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u89c6\u542c\u641c\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728EgoLifeQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523057.5%\u7684SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728Video-MME\uff08Long\uff09\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f9774.1%\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "EGAgent\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u5177\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\u7eb5\u5411\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u5168\u5929\u5019AI\u52a9\u624b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Accurate and robust 2D-3D vessel registration is essential to guide microcatheter and instruments during TACE, enabling precise localization of vascular structures and optimal therapeutic targeting. To tackle this issue, we develop a coarse-to-fine registration strategy. First, we introduce a global alignment module, structure-aware perspective n-point (SA-PnP), to establish correspondence between 2D and 3D vessel structures. Second, we propose TempDiffReg, a temporal diffusion model that performs vessel deformation iteratively by leveraging temporal context to capture complex anatomical variations and local structural changes. We collected data from 23 patients and constructed 626 paired multi-frame samples for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both accuracy and anatomical plausibility. Specifically, our method achieves a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.63 mm and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.51 mm in registration accuracy, representing 66.7\\% lower MSE and 17.7\\% lower MAE compared to the most competitive existing approaches. It has the potential to assist less-experienced clinicians in safely and efficiently performing complex TACE procedures, ultimately enhancing both surgical outcomes and patient care.

However, existing YOLO detectors lack explicit modeling of heterogeneous object responses within shared feature channels, which limits further performance gains. To address this, we propose YOLO-DS, a framework built around a novel Dual-Statistic Synergy Operator (DSO). The DSO decouples object features by jointly modeling the channel-wise mean and the peak-to-mean difference. Building upon the DSO, we design two lightweight gating modules: the Dual-Statistic Synergy Gating (DSG) module for adaptive channel-wise feature selection, and the Multi-Path Segmented Gating (MSG) module for depth-wise feature weighting. On the MS-COCO benchmark, YOLO-DS consistently outperforms YOLOv8 across five model scales (N, S, M, L, X), achieving AP gains of 1.1% to 1.7% with only a minimal increase in inference latency.

However, most existing methods rely on reactive state-action mappings without explicitly modeling how actions causally transform subsequent visual observations. Lacking such vision-action causality, agents cannot anticipate the visual changes induced by its own actions, leading to unstable behaviors, weak generalization, and cumulative error along trajectory. To address these issues, we introduce \\textsc{NaVIDA} (\\textbf{Nav}igation with \\textbf{I}nverse \\textbf{D}ynamics \\textbf{A}ugmentation), a unified VLN framework that couples policy learning with action-grounded visual dynamics and adaptive execution. \\textsc{NaVIDA} augments training with chunk-based inverse-dynamics supervision to learn causal relationship between visual changes and corresponding actions. To structure this supervision and extend the effective planning range, \\textsc{NaVIDA} employs hierarchical probabilistic action chunking (HPAC), which organizes trajectories into multi-step chunks and provides discriminative, longer-range visual-change cues. To further curb error accumulation and stabilize behavior at inference, an entropy-guided mechanism adaptively sets the execution horizon of action chunks.

Code: https://github.com/Lcrucial1f/MPS-CLIP", "summary": "Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models like CLIP have significantly advanced Remote Sensing Image-Text Retrieval (RSITR). However, existing methods predominantly rely on coarse-grained global alignment, which often overlooks the dense, multi-scale semantics inherent in overhead imagery. Moreover, adapting these heavy models via full fine-tuning incurs prohibitive computational costs and risks catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose MPS-CLIP, a parameter-efficient framework designed to shift the retrieval paradigm from global matching to keyword-guided fine-grained alignment. Specifically, we leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract core semantic keywords, guiding the Segment Anything Model (SamGeo) to generate semantically relevant sub-perspectives. To efficiently adapt the frozen backbone, we introduce a Gated Global Attention (G^2A) adapter, which captures global context and long-range dependencies with minimal overhead. Furthermore, a Multi-Perspective Representation (MPR) module aggregates these local cues into robust multi-perspective embeddings. The framework is optimized via a hybrid objective combining multi-perspective contrastive and weighted triplet losses, which dynamically selects maximum-response perspectives to suppress noise and enforce precise semantic matching. Extensive experiments on the RSICD and RSITMD benchmarks demonstrate that MPS-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance with 35.18% and 48.40% mean Recall (mR), respectively, significantly outperforming full fine-tuning baselines and recent competitive methods.

Remarkable progresses have been achieved while the existing methods typically treat it as a direct regression or iterative refinement problem and often struggling to capture complex geometric transformations or generalize across different domains. In this work, we propose HomoFM, a new framework that introduces the flow matching technique from generative modeling into the homography estimation task for the first time. Unlike the existing methods, we formulate homography estimation problem as a velocity field learning problem. By modeling a continuous and point-wise velocity field that transforms noisy distributions into registered coordinates, the proposed network recovers high-precision transformations through a conditional flow trajectory. Furthermore, to address the challenge of domain shifts issue, e.g., the cases of multimodal matching or varying illumination scenarios, we integrate a gradient reversal layer (GRL) into the feature extraction backbone. This domain adaptation strategy explicitly constrains the encoder to learn domain-invariant representations, significantly enhancing the network's robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing that HomoFM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both estimation accuracy and robustness on standard benchmarks.

Although recent approaches using large CNNs such as VGG and ResNet achieve reasonable accuracy, they are computationally expensive and memory-intensive, limiting their practicality for real-time applications. We address these challenges using a lightweight and efficient facial emotion recognition pipeline based on EfficientNetB2, trained using a two-stage warm-up and fine-tuning strategy. The model is enhanced with AdamW optimization, decoupled weight decay, label smoothing (epsilon = 0.06) to reduce annotation noise, and clipped class weights to mitigate class imbalance, along with dropout, mixed-precision training, and extensive real-time data augmentation. The model is trained using a stratified 87.5%/12.5% train-validation split while keeping the official test set intact, achieving a test accuracy of 68.78% with nearly ten times fewer parameters than VGG16-based baselines.

However, their outputs remain vulnerable to hallucinations (i.e., responses that contradict visual facts), posing significant risks in high-stakes medical scenarios. Recent introspective detection methods, particularly uncertainty-based approaches, offer computational efficiency but are fundamentally indirect, as they estimate predictive uncertainty for an image-question pair rather than verifying the factual correctness of a specific answer. To address this limitation, we propose Visual Logical Loop Verification (V-Loop), a training-free and plug-and-play framework for hallucination detection in medical VQA. V-Loop introduces a bidirectional reasoning process that forms a visually grounded logical loop to verify factual correctness. Given an input, the MLLM produces an answer for the primary input pair. V-Loop extracts semantic units from the primary QA pair, generates a verification question by conditioning on the answer unit to re-query the question unit, and enforces visual attention consistency to ensure answering both primary question and verification question rely on the same image evidence. If the verification answer matches the expected semantic content, the logical loop closes, indicating factual grounding; otherwise, the primary answer is flagged as hallucinated.

This paper proposes a vision-language-model (VLM) guided framework that accelerates and stabilizes multi-material parameter estimation in a differentiable RT (DRT) engine. A VLM parses scene images to infer material categories and maps them to quantitative priors via an ITU-R material table, yielding informed conductivity initializations. The VLM further selects informative transmitter/receiver placements that promote diverse, material-discriminative paths. Starting from these priors, the DRT performs gradient-based refinement using measured received signal strengths. Experiments in NVIDIA Sionna on indoor scenes show 2-4$\\times$ faster convergence and 10-100$\\times$ lower final parameter error compared with uniform or random initialization and random placement baselines, achieving sub-0.1\\% mean relative error with only a few receivers. Complexity analyses indicate per-iteration time scales near-linearly with the number of materials and measurement setups, while VLM-guided placement reduces the measurements required for accurate recovery. Ablations over RT depth and ray counts confirm further accuracy gains without significant per-iteration overhead. Results demonstrate that semantic priors from VLMs effectively guide physics-based optimization for fast and reliable RF material estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u591a\u6750\u6599\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u5c04\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff08DRT\uff09\u5f15\u64ce\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u548c\u4f4e\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u9006\u5c04\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u654f\u611f\u4e14\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684RF\u6750\u6599\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u652f\u63016G\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u78c1\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528VLM\u89e3\u6790\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u65ad\u6750\u6599\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ITU-R\u6750\u6599\u8868\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5b9a\u91cf\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bfc\u7535\u7387\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff1bVLM\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9009\u62e9\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u53d1\u5c04\u5668/\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6750\u6599\u533a\u5206\u8def\u5f84\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5148\u9a8c\uff0cDRT\u4f7f\u7528\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u63a5\u6536\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728NVIDIA Sionna\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5747\u5300\u6216\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u53ca\u968f\u673a\u653e\u7f6e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb2-4\u500d\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u53c2\u6570\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e10-100\u500d\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u4e8e0.1%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "VLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6307\u5bfc\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u53ef\u9760\u7684RF\u6750\u6599\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0cVLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9009\u62e9\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6062\u590d\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u6b21\u6570\u3002"}}

Current artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in orthopedics predominantly rely on task-specific, supervised learning paradigms. These methods are inherently fragmented, require extensive annotated datasets, and often lack generalizability across different modalities and clinical scenarios. The development of foundation models in this field has been constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, curated, and open-source musculoskeletal datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce OrthoFoundation, a multimodal vision foundation model optimized for musculoskeletal pathology. We constructed a pre-training dataset of 1.2 million unlabeled knee X-ray and MRI images from internal and public databases. Utilizing a Dinov3 backbone, the model was trained via self-supervised contrastive learning to capture robust radiological representations. OrthoFoundation achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across 14 downstream tasks. It attained superior accuracy in X-ray osteoarthritis diagnosis and ranked first in MRI structural injury detection. The model demonstrated remarkable label efficiency, matching supervised baselines using only 50% of labeled data. Furthermore, despite being pre-trained on knee images, OrthoFoundation exhibited exceptional cross-anatomy generalization to the hip, shoulder, and ankle. OrthoFoundation represents a significant advancement toward general-purpose AI for musculoskeletal imaging. By learning fundamental, joint-agnostic radiological semantics from large-scale multimodal data, it overcomes the limitations of conventional models, which provides a robust framework for reducing annotation burdens and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "OrthoFoundation\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u808c\u8089\u9aa8\u9abc\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528120\u4e07\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u819d\u5173\u8282X\u5149\u548cMRI\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u572814\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u8de8\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u808c\u8089\u9aa8\u9abc\u75be\u75c5\u662f\u5168\u7403\u6b8b\u75be\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u89e3\u8bfb\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u9aa8\u79d1AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u573a\u666f\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u53d7\u5230\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5f00\u6e90\u808c\u8089\u9aa8\u9abc\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b120\u4e07\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u819d\u5173\u8282X\u5149\u548cMRI\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Dinov3\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u572814\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff1aX\u5149\u9aa8\u5173\u8282\u708e\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f18\u5f02\uff0cMRI\u7ed3\u6784\u635f\u4f24\u68c0\u6d4b\u6392\u540d\u7b2c\u4e00\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752850%\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u5339\u914d\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u819d\u5173\u8282\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u51fa\u8272\u5730\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u9acb\u3001\u80a9\u3001\u8e1d\u7b49\u5176\u4ed6\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "OrthoFoundation\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u808c\u8089\u9aa8\u9abc\u5f71\u50cf\u901a\u7528AI\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u3001\u5173\u8282\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u8d1f\u62c5\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, a major challenge in this projection is the many-to-one conflict, where multiple 3D points are mapped onto the same pixel in the range image, requiring a selection strategy. Existing approaches typically retain the point with the smallest depth (closest to the LiDAR), disregarding semantic relevance and object structure, which leads to the loss of important contextual information. In this paper, we extend the depth-based selection rule by incorporating contextual information from both instance centers and class labels, introducing two mechanisms: \\textit{Centerness-Aware Projection (CAP)} and \\textit{Class-Weighted-Aware Projection (CWAP)}. In CAP, point depths are adjusted according to their distance from the instance center, thereby prioritizing central instance points over noisy boundary and background points. In CWAP, object classes are prioritized through user-defined weights, offering flexibility in the projection strategy. Our evaluations on the SemanticKITTI dataset show that CAP preserves more instance points during projection, achieving up to a 3.1\\% mIoU improvement compared to the baseline. Furthermore, CWAP enhances the performance of targeted classes while having a negligible impact on the performance of other classes", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u7684LiDAR\u70b9\u4e91\u5230\u8ddd\u79bb\u56fe\u50cf\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aCAP\uff08\u4e2d\u5fc3\u611f\u77e5\u6295\u5f71\uff09\u548cCWAP\uff08\u7c7b\u522b\u52a0\u6743\u611f\u77e5\u6295\u5f71\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5165\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u6295\u5f71\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfLiDAR\u70b9\u4e91\u5230\u8ddd\u79bb\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u4fdd\u7559\u6700\u8fd1\u70b9\uff09\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u8981\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u4fdd\u7559\u66f4\u591a\u6709\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff1a1) CAP\uff1a\u6839\u636e\u70b9\u5230\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u8c03\u6574\u6df1\u5ea6\u503c\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u4fdd\u7559\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u70b9\u800c\u975e\u566a\u58f0\u8fb9\u754c\u70b9\uff1b2) CWAP\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u6743\u91cd\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u8c61\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728SemanticKITTI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cCAP\u5728\u6295\u5f71\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u66f4\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u70b9\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad83.1%\u7684mIoU\u63d0\u5347\u3002CWAP\u80fd\u591f\u589e\u5f3a\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u522b\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5165\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u6295\u5f71\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347LiDAR\u70b9\u4e91\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4f18\u76842D\u8868\u793a\u3002"}}

However, the step execution capability of these agents has gradually emerged as a new bottleneck for task completion. In particular, existing GUI agents often adopt overly simplified strategies for handling swipe interactions, preventing them from accurately replicating human-like behavior. To address this limitation, we decompose human swipe gestures into multiple quantifiable dimensions and propose an automated pipeline SwipeGen to synthesize human-like swipe interactions through GUI exploration. Based on this pipeline, we construct and release the first benchmark for evaluating the swipe execution capability of GUI agents. Furthermore, leveraging the synthesized data, we propose GUISwiper, a GUI agent with enhanced interaction execution capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that GUISwiper achieves a swipe execution accuracy of 69.07%, representing a 214% improvement over existing VLM baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSwipeGen\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u4eba\u7c7b\u6ed1\u52a8\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2aGUI\u4ee3\u7406\u6ed1\u52a8\u6267\u884c\u80fd\u529b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1GUISwiper\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709VLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347214%", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GUI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u6ed1\u52a8\u4ea4\u4e92\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u590d\u5236\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7684\u65b0\u74f6\u9888", "method": "\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u6ed1\u52a8\u624b\u52bf\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSwipeGen\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\u901a\u8fc7GUI\u63a2\u7d22\u5408\u6210\u4eba\u7c7b\u6ed1\u52a8\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1GUISwiper\u4ee3\u7406", "result": "GUISwiper\u8fbe\u523069.07%\u7684\u6ed1\u52a8\u6267\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709VLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347214%", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u4eba\u7c7b\u6ed1\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u5408\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347GUI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6267\u884c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898"}}

Two tumor aware experimental setups are introduced to address class-specific diagnostic challenges. The first setup employs a Boosted Feature Space (BFS), where independently customized DenseNet and Swint branches learn complementary local and global representations that are dimension aligned, fused, and boosted, enabling highly sensitive detection of diffuse glioma patterns by successfully learning the features of irregular shape, poorly defined mass, and heterogeneous texture. The second setup adopts a hierarchical DenseNet Swint architecture with Deep Feature Extraction have Dual Residual connections (DFE and DR), in which DenseNet serves as a stem CNN for structured local feature learning, while Swin_t models global tumor morphology, effectively suppressing false negatives in meningioma and pituitary tumor classification by learning the features of well defined mass, location (outside brain) and enlargments in tumors (dural tail or upward extension). DenseNet is customized at the input level to match MRI spatial characteristics, leveraging dense residual connectivity to preserve texture information and mitigate vanishing-gradient effects. In parallel, Swint is tailored through task aligned patch embedding and shifted-window self attention to efficiently capture hierarchical global dependencies.

To bridge this gap, we propose NRVBench, the first dedicated and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate non-rigid video editing. First, we curate a high-quality dataset consisting of 180 non-rigid motion videos from six physics-based categories, equipped with 2,340 fine-grained task instructions and 360 multiple-choice questions. Second, we propose NRVE-Acc, a novel evaluation metric based on Vision-Language Models that can rigorously assess physical compliance, temporal consistency, and instruction alignment, overcoming the limitations of general metrics in capturing complex dynamics. Third, we introduce a training-free baseline, VM-Edit, which utilizes a dual-region denoising mechanism to achieve structure-aware control, balancing structural preservation and dynamic deformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that while current methods have shortcomings in maintaining physical plausibility, our method achieves excellent performance across both standard and proposed metrics.

However, their capabilities to perceive and assess portrait images, a domain characterized by distinct structural and perceptual properties, remain largely underexplored. To this end, we introduce Q-Bench-Portrait, the first holistic benchmark specifically designed for portrait image quality perception, comprising 2,765 image-question-answer triplets and featuring (1) diverse portrait image sources, including natural, synthetic distortion, AI-generated, artistic, and computer graphics images; (2) comprehensive quality dimensions, covering technical distortions, AIGC-specific distortions, and aesthetics; and (3) a range of question formats, including single-choice, multiple-choice, true/false, and open-ended questions, at both global and local levels. Based on Q-Bench-Portrait, we evaluate 20 open-source and 5 closed-source MLLMs, revealing that although current models demonstrate some competence in portrait image perception, their performance remains limited and imprecise, with a clear gap relative to human judgments.

The system integrates three components -- slice classification, inner ear localization, and sequence-specific segmentation -- into a single workflow that computes per-ear endolymphatic-to-vestibular volume ratios (ELR) directly from whole MRI volumes, eliminating the need for manual intervention.\n  Trained with only 3 to 6 annotated slices per patient, OREHAS generalized effectively to full 3D volumes, achieving Dice scores of 0.90 for SPACE-MRC and 0.75 for REAL-IR. In an external validation cohort with complete manual annotations, OREHAS closely matched expert ground truth (VSI = 74.3%) and substantially outperformed the clinical syngo.via software (VSI = 42.5%), which tended to overestimate endolymphatic volumes. Across 19 test patients, vestibular measurements from OREHAS were consistent with syngo.via, while endolymphatic volumes were systematically smaller and more physiologically realistic.\n  These results show that reliable and reproducible EH quantification can be achieved from standard MRI using limited supervision. By combining efficient deep-learning-based segmentation with a clinically aligned volumetric workflow, OREHAS reduces operator dependence, ensures methodological consistency. Besides, the results are compatible with established imaging protocols. The approach provides a robust foundation for large-scale studies and for recalibrating clinical diagnostic thresholds based on accurate volumetric measurements of the inner ear.", "AI": {"tldr": "OREHAS\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5e38\u89c43D MRI\u81ea\u52a8\u91cf\u5316\u5185\u6dcb\u5df4\u79ef\u6c34\u7684\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5272\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4f53\u79ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5185\u6dcb\u5df4\u79ef\u6c34\u91cf\u5316\u9700\u8981\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f6f\u4ef6syngo.via\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9ad8\u4f30\u5185\u6dcb\u5df4\u4f53\u79ef\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "OREHAS\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u5207\u7247\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u5185\u8033\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u4e00\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6574\u4e2aMRI\u4f53\u79ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u8033\u7684\u5185\u6dcb\u5df4-\u524d\u5ead\u4f53\u79ef\u6bd4\u3002\u4ec5\u9700\u6bcf\u60a3\u80053-6\u4e2a\u6807\u6ce8\u5207\u7247\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\uff0cOREHAS Dice\u5206\u6570\u8fbe\u52300.90\uff08SPACE-MRC\uff09\u548c0.75\uff08REAL-IR\uff09\uff0c\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff08VSI=74.3%\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f6f\u4ef6syngo.via\uff08VSI=42.5%\uff09\u3002OREHAS\u7684\u5185\u6dcb\u5df4\u4f53\u79ef\u66f4\u5c0f\u4e14\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u751f\u7406\u5b9e\u9645\u3002", "conclusion": "OREHAS\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u9650\u76d1\u7763\u4ece\u6807\u51c6MRI\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u5185\u6dcb\u5df4\u79ef\u6c34\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u9608\u503c\u91cd\u65b0\u6821\u51c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, direct eye tracking is often unavailable due to hardware limitations or privacy concerns. To address this, we present a novel gaze prediction framework that combines Head-Mounted Display (HMD) motion signals with visual saliency cues derived from video frames. Our method employs UniSal, a lightweight saliency encoder, to extract visual features, which are then fused with HMD motion data and processed through a time-series prediction module.

Since pirated images are often geometrically distorted by operations such as scaling and cropping, accurate synchronization - detecting the embedding position of the watermark - is critical for proper extraction. In particular, cropping changes the origin of the image, making synchronization difficult. However, few existing methods are robust against cropping. To address this issue, we propose a watermarking method that estimates geometric transformations applied to a stego image using a pilot signal, allowing synchronization even after cropping. A grid-shaped pilot signal with distinct horizontal and vertical values is embedded in the image. When the image is transformed, the grid is also distorted. By analyzing this distortion, the transformation matrix can be estimated. Applying the Radon transform to the distorted image allows estimation of the grid angles and intervals. In addition, since the horizontal and vertical grid lines are encoded differently, the grid orientation can be determined, which reduces ambiguity. To validate our method, we performed simulations with anisotropic scaling, rotation, shearing, and cropping. The results show that the proposed method accurately estimates transformation matrices with low error under both single and composite attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u5f62\u5bfc\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u6362\u540e\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u7578\u53d8\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u88c1\u526a\u7b49\u51e0\u4f55\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u540c\u6b65\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u88c1\u526a\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u88c1\u526a\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u56fe\u50cf\u539f\u70b9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6c34\u5370\u540c\u6b65\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u88c1\u526a\uff09\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u540c\u6b65\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5d4c\u5165\u7f51\u683c\u5f62\u5bfc\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u5782\u76f4\u7ebf\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7f16\u7801\u3002\u5f53\u56fe\u50cf\u88ab\u53d8\u6362\u65f6\uff0c\u7f51\u683c\u4e5f\u968f\u4e4b\u7578\u53d8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Radon\u53d8\u6362\u5206\u6790\u7578\u53d8\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7f51\u683c\u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u95f4\u9694\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d8\u6362\u77e9\u9635\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u7ebf\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u7f51\u683c\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6b67\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u9879\u5f02\u6027\u7f29\u653e\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u526a\u5207\u548c\u88c1\u526a\u7b49\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u53d8\u6362\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u548c\u590d\u5408\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u5747\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u5bfc\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u88c1\u526a\u7b49\u51e0\u4f55\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u88c1\u526a\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u540c\u6b65\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Standard neural network architectures rely on local operations (convolutions or grid-patches) that are ill-suited for the global, non-local nature of raw frequency-domain (k-Space) data. In this work, we propose a novel complex-valued Vision Transformer (kViT) designed to perform classification directly on k-Space data. To bridge the geometric disconnect between current architectures and MRI physics, we introduce a radial k-Space patching strategy that respects the spectral energy distribution of the frequency-domain. Extensive experiments on the fastMRI and in-house datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves classification performance competitive with state-of-the-art image-domain baselines (ResNet, EfficientNet, ViT). Crucially, kViT exhibits superior robustness to high acceleration factors and offers a paradigm shift in computational efficiency, reducing VRAM consumption during training by up to 68$\\times$ compared to standard methods.

We argue that performance is fundamentally I/O-bound. We show that structuring analysis as streaming passes over data is crucial. For 3D volumes, two representations are popular: stacks of 2D slices (e.g., directories or multi-page TIFF) and 3D chunked layouts (e.g., Zarr/HDF5). While for a few algorithms, chunked layout on disk is crucial to keep disk I/O at a minimum, we show how the slice-based streaming architecture can be built on top of either image representation in a manner that minimizes disk I/O. This is in particular advantageous for algorithms relying on neighbouring values, since the slicing streaming architecture is 1D, which implies that there are only 2 possible sweeping orders, both of which are aligned with the order in which images are read from the disk. This is in contrast to 3D chunks, in which any sweep cannot be done without accessing each chunk at least 9 times. We formalize this with sweep-based execution (natural 2D/3D orders), windowed operations, and overlap-aware tiling to minimize redundant access. Building on these principles, we introduce a domain-specific language (DSL) that encodes algorithms with intrinsic knowledge of their optimal streaming and memory use; the DSL performs compile-time and run-time pipeline analyses to automatically select window sizes, fuse stages, tee and zip streams, and schedule passes for limited-RAM machines, yielding near-linear I/O scans and predictable memory footprints. The approach integrates with existing tooling for segmentation and morphology but reframes pre/post-processing as pipelines that privilege sequential read/write patterns, delivering substantial throughput gains for extremely large images without requiring full-volume residency in memory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u8d85\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982PB\u7ea7\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u6570\u636e\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316I/O\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5927\u4e8e\u5185\u5b58\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u5904\u7406PB\u7ea7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7I/O\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u8d85\u51fa\u5185\u5b58\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6d41\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5207\u7247\u548c\u5206\u5757\u4e24\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\uff08DSL\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u8bd1\u65f6\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u7a97\u53e3\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u878d\u5408\u3001\u6d41\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5197\u4f59\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u7684I/O\u626b\u63cf\u548c\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d85\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5c06\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u52a0\u8f7d\u5230\u5185\u5b58\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6d41\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u7ed3\u5408DSL\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u4e8e\u5185\u5b58\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u4f9d\u8d56\u90bb\u57df\u503c\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u5904\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Standard practice aligns all specimens via Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) prior to splitting data into training and test sets, potentially introducing statistical dependence and contaminating downstream predictive models. Here, the effects of GPA-induced contamination are formally characterised using controlled 2D and 3D simulations across varying sample sizes, landmark densities, and allometric patterns. A novel realignment procedure is proposed, whereby test specimens are aligned to the training set prior to model fitting, eliminating cross-sample dependency. Simulations reveal a robust \"diagonal\" in sample-size vs. landmark-space, reflecting the scaling of RMSE under isotropic variation, with slopes analytically derived from the degrees of freedom in Procrustes tangent space. The importance of spatial autocorrelation among landmarks is further demonstrated using linear and convolutional regression models, highlighting performance degradation when landmark relationships are ignored.

We introduce DisasterInsight, a multimodal benchmark designed to evaluate vision-language models (VLMs) on realistic disaster analysis tasks. DisasterInsight restructures the xBD dataset into approximately 112K building-centered instances and supports instruction-diverse evaluation across multiple tasks, including building-function classification, damage-level and disaster-type classification, counting, and structured report generation aligned with humanitarian assessment guidelines.\n  To establish domain-adapted baselines, we propose DI-Chat, obtained by fine-tuning existing VLM backbones on disaster-specific instruction data using parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art generic and remote-sensing VLMs reveal substantial performance gaps across tasks, particularly in damage understanding and structured report generation. DI-Chat achieves significant improvements on damage-level and disaster-type classification as well as report generation quality, while building-function classification remains challenging for all evaluated models.

Active learning (AL) alleviates this burden by prioritizing informative samples for annotation, typically through a diversity-based cold-start phase followed by uncertainty-driven selection. We propose a novel cold-start sampling strategy that combines foundation-model embeddings with clustering, including automatic selection of the number of clusters and proportional sampling across clusters, to construct a diverse and representative initial training. This is followed by an uncertainty-based AL framework that integrates spatial diversity to guide sample selection. The proposed method is intuitive and interpretable, enabling visualization of the feature-space distribution of candidate samples. We evaluate our approach on three datasets spanning X-ray and MRI modalities. On the CheXmask dataset, the cold-start strategy outperforms random selection, improving Dice from 0.918 to 0.929 and reducing the Hausdorff distance from 32.41 to 27.66 mm. In the AL setting, combined entropy and diversity selection improves Dice from 0.919 to 0.939 and reduces the Hausdorff distance from 30.10 to 19.16 mm. On the Montgomery dataset, cold-start gains are substantial, with Dice improving from 0.928 to 0.950 and Hausdorff distance decreasing from 14.22 to 9.38 mm. On the SynthStrip dataset, cold-start selection slightly affects Dice but reduces the Hausdorff distance from 9.43 to 8.69 mm, while active learning improves Dice from 0.816 to 0.826 and reduces the Hausdorff distance from 7.76 to 6.38 mm.

Unlike unified models that face expensive training costs and understanding-generation trade-offs, GenAgent decouples these capabilities through an agentic framework: understanding is handled by the multimodal model itself, while generation is achieved by treating image generation models as invokable tools. Crucially, unlike existing modular systems constrained by static pipelines, this design enables autonomous multi-turn interactions where the agent generates multimodal chains-of-thought encompassing reasoning, tool invocation, judgment, and reflection to iteratively refine outputs. We employ a two-stage training strategy: first, cold-start with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality tool invocation and reflection data to bootstrap agent behaviors; second, end-to-end agentic reinforcement learning combining pointwise rewards (final image quality) and pairwise rewards (reflection accuracy), with trajectory resampling for enhanced multi-turn exploration. GenAgent significantly boosts base generator(FLUX.1-dev) performance on GenEval++ (+23.6\\%) and WISE (+14\\%). Beyond performance gains, our framework demonstrates three key properties: 1) cross-tool generalization to generators with varying capabilities, 2) test-time scaling with consistent improvements across interaction rounds, and 3) task-adaptive reasoning that automatically adjusts to different tasks.

Although the existing learned compression methods have achieved promising results for natural images from earth, there remain two critical issues that hinder their effectiveness for Martian image compression: 1) They overlook the highly-limited computational resources on Mars; 2) They do not utilize the strong \\textit{inter-image} similarities across Martian images to advance image compression performance. Motivated by our empirical analysis of the strong \\textit{intra-} and \\textit{inter-image} similarities from the perspective of texture, color, and semantics, we propose a reference-based Martian asymmetrical image compression (REMAC) approach, which shifts computational complexity from the encoder to the resource-rich decoder and simultaneously improves compression performance. To leverage \\textit{inter-image} similarities, we propose a reference-guided entropy module and a ref-decoder that utilize useful information from reference images, reducing redundant operations at the encoder and achieving superior compression performance. To exploit \\textit{intra-image} similarities, the ref-decoder adopts a deep, multi-scale architecture with enlarged receptive field size to model long-range spatial dependencies. Additionally, we develop a latent feature recycling mechanism to further alleviate the extreme computational constraints on Mars.

In particular, FemoroAcetabular Impingement (FAI) screening relies on angles traditionally measured on X-rays. However, assessing the height and span of the impingement area requires also a 3D view through an MRI scan. The two modalities inform the surgeon on different aspects of the condition. In this work, we conduct a matched-cohort validation study (89 patients, paired MRI/X-ray) using standard heatmap regression architectures to assess cross-modality clinical equivalence. Seen that landmark detection has been proven effective on X-rays, we show that MRI also achieves equivalent localisation and diagnostic accuracy for cam-type impingement. Our method demonstrates clinical feasibility for FAI assessment in coronal views of 3D MRI volumes, opening the possibility for volumetric analysis through placing further landmarks. These results support integrating automated FAI assessment into routine MRI workflows.

However, real-world medical datasets frequently exhibit severe class imbalance, where positive samples substantially outnumber negative samples, leading to biased models with low recall rates for minority classes. This imbalance not only compromises diagnostic accuracy but also poses clinical misdiagnosis risks. To address this challenge, we propose SDA-QEC (Simplified Diffusion Augmentation with Quantum-Enhanced Classification), an innovative framework that integrates simplified diffusion-based data augmentation with quantum-enhanced feature discrimination. Our approach employs a lightweight diffusion augmentor to generate high-quality synthetic samples for minority classes, rebalancing the training distribution. Subsequently, a quantum feature layer embedded within MobileNetV2 architecture enhances the model's discriminative capability through high-dimensional feature mapping in Hilbert space. Comprehensive experiments on coronary angiography image classification demonstrate that SDA-QEC achieves 98.33% accuracy, 98.78% AUC, and 98.33% F1-score, significantly outperforming classical baselines including ResNet18, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121, and VGG16. Notably, our framework simultaneously attains 98.33% sensitivity and 98.33% specificity, achieving a balanced performance critical for clinical deployment.

However, the transmission speed of the satellite downlink has become a major bottleneck in certain applications, such as disaster monitoring and emergency mapping, which demand a fast response ability. We propose an efficient AI-enabled Satellite Edge Computing paradigm for hyperspectral image classification, facilitating the satellites to attain autonomous decision-making. To accommodate the resource constraints of satellite platforms, the proposed method adopts a lightweight, non-deep learning framework integrated with a few-shot learning strategy. Moreover, onboard processing on satellites could be faced with sensor failure and scan pattern errors, which result in degraded image quality with bad/misaligned pixels and mixed noise. To address these challenges, we develop a novel two-stage pixel-wise label propagation scheme that utilizes only intrinsic spectral features at the single pixel level without the necessity to consider spatial structural information as requested by deep neural networks. In the first stage, initial pixel labels are obtained by propagating selected anchor labels through the constructed anchor-pixel affinity matrix.

Existing approaches address this using external verifiers or additional training on augmented data, which is computationally expensive and still limited in capturing fine-grained motion. In this work, we present self-refining video sampling, a simple method that uses a pre-trained video generator trained on large-scale datasets as its own self-refiner. By interpreting the generator as a denoising autoencoder, we enable iterative inner-loop refinement at inference time without any external verifier or additional training. We further introduce an uncertainty-aware refinement strategy that selectively refines regions based on self-consistency, which prevents artifacts caused by over-refinement.

Adapters derived from the same base model can be merged with weights, enabling the synthesis of new visual results within a vast and continuous design space. To explore this space, current workflows rely on manual slider-based tuning, an approach that scales poorly and makes weight selection difficult, even when the candidate set is limited to 20-30 adapters. We propose GimmBO to support interactive exploration of adapter merging for image generation through Preferential Bayesian Optimization (PBO). Motivated by observations from real-world usage, including sparsity and constrained weight ranges, we introduce a two-stage BO backend that improves sampling efficiency and convergence in high-dimensional spaces.

Existing methods underutilize frequency information and rely on static convolutional operations, which constrain the capacity to obtain rich feature representations and hinder the effective exploitation of deep semantic features. To address these issues, we propose EFSI-DETR, a novel detection framework that integrates efficient semantic feature enhancement with dynamic frequency-spatial guidance. EFSI-DETR comprises two main components: (1) a Dynamic Frequency-Spatial Unified Synergy Network (DyFusNet) that jointly exploits frequency and spatial cues for robust multi-scale feature fusion, (2) an Efficient Semantic Feature Concentrator (ESFC) that enables deep semantic extraction with minimal computational cost. Furthermore, a Fine-grained Feature Retention (FFR) strategy is adopted to incorporate spatially rich shallow features during fusion to preserve fine-grained details, crucial for small object detection in UAV imagery.

In segmentation, existing pipelines are typically tuned to large, homogeneous regions, but their performance drops when objects are small, sparse, or locally irregular. In this work, we propose a scale-aware SSL adaptation that integrates small-window cropping into the augmentation pipeline, zooming in on fine-scale structures during pretraining. We evaluate this approach across two domains with markedly different data modalities: seismic imaging, where the goal is to segment sparse faults, and neuroimaging, where the task is to delineate small cellular structures. In both settings, our method yields consistent improvements over standard and state-of-the-art baselines under label constraints, improving accuracy by up to 13% for fault segmentation and 5% for cell delineation. In contrast, large-scale features such as seismic facies or tissue regions see little benefit, underscoring that the value of SSL depends critically on the scale of the target objects.

Standard diffusion approaches often rely on a single, global linear transfer between domains. We find that this shortcut forces the sampler to traverse off-manifold, high-cost regions, inflating the correction burden and inviting semantic drift. We refer to this shared failure mode as fixed-schedule domain transfer. In this paper, we embed domain-shift dynamics directly into the generative process. Our model predicts a spatially varying mixing field at every reverse step and injects an explicit, target-consistent restoration term into the drift.

This task, essential for public safety applications, is hindered by cross-modal discrepancies and ambiguous user queries. We introduce CONQUER, a two-stage framework designed to address these challenges by enhancing cross-modal alignment during training and adaptively refining queries at inference. During training, CONQUER employs multi-granularity encoding, complementary pair mining, and context-guided optimal matching based on Optimal Transport to learn robust embeddings. At inference, a plug-and-play query enhancement module refines vague or incomplete queries via anchor selection and attribute-driven enrichment, without requiring retraining of the backbone. Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid demonstrate that CONQUER consistently outperforms strong baselines in both Rank-1 accuracy and mAP, yielding notable improvements in cross-domain and incomplete-query scenarios. These results highlight CONQUER as a practical and effective solution for real-world TBPS deployment.

Previous 3D talking head generation methods have relied on domain-specific heuristics such as warping-based facial motion representation priors to animate talking motions, yet still produce inaccurate 3D avatar reconstructions, thus undermining the realism of generated animations. We introduce Splat-Portrait, a Gaussian-splatting-based method that addresses the challenges of 3D head reconstruction and lip motion synthesis. Our approach automatically learns to disentangle a single portrait image into a static 3D reconstruction represented as static Gaussian Splatting, and a predicted whole-image 2D background. It then generates natural lip motion conditioned on input audio, without any motion driven priors. Training is driven purely by 2D reconstruction and score-distillation losses, without 3D supervision nor landmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Splat-Portrait exhibits superior performance on talking head generation and novel view synthesis, achieving better visual quality compared to previous works.

An Attraction-Centric Evaluation of Global Visual Knowledge", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "comment": "Work in progress", "summary": "Recent advances in text-to-video generation have produced visually compelling results, yet it remains unclear whether these models encode geographically equitable visual knowledge. In this work, we investigate the geo-equity and geographically grounded visual knowledge of text-to-video models through an attraction-centric evaluation. We introduce Geo-Attraction Landmark Probing (GAP), a systematic framework for assessing how faithfully models synthesize tourist attractions from diverse regions, and construct GEOATTRACTION-500, a benchmark of 500 globally distributed attractions spanning varied regions and popularity levels. GAP integrates complementary metrics that disentangle overall video quality from attraction-specific knowledge, including global structural alignment, fine-grained keypoint-based alignment, and vision-language model judgments, all validated against human evaluation. Applying GAP to the state-of-the-art text-to-video model Sora 2, we find that, contrary to common assumptions of strong geographic bias, the model exhibits a relatively uniform level of geographically grounded visual knowledge across regions, development levels, and cultural groupings, with only weak dependence on attraction popularity. These results suggest that current text-to-video models express global visual knowledge more evenly than expected, highlighting both their promise for globally deployed applications and the need for continued evaluation as such systems evolve.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGAP\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5730\u7406\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Sora 2\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5168\u7403\u89c6\u89c9\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0a\u6bd4\u9884\u671f\u66f4\u5747\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u5438\u5f15\u4eba\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u5730\u7406\u4e0a\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5730\u7406\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u5730\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u89c6\u89c9\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGeo-Attraction Landmark Probing (GAP)\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efaGEOATTRACTION-500\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u542b500\u4e2a\u5168\u7403\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u65c5\u6e38\u666f\u70b9\uff09\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5224\u65ad\u7b49\u4e92\u8865\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5c06GAP\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578bSora 2\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u5f3a\u70c8\u5730\u7406\u504f\u89c1\u5047\u8bbe\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u533a\u3001\u53d1\u5c55\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u6587\u5316\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u76f8\u5bf9\u5747\u5300\u7684\u5730\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u89c6\u89c9\u77e5\u8bc6\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4ec5\u5bf9\u666f\u70b9\u77e5\u540d\u5ea6\u6709\u5fae\u5f31\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u5168\u7403\u89c6\u89c9\u77e5\u8bc6\u6bd4\u9884\u671f\u66f4\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u8fd9\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u5168\u7403\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u968f\u7740\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u5c55\u9700\u8981\u6301\u7eed\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, addressing the heterogeneous nature of OOD data, ranging from low-level corruption to semantic shifts, remains a complex challenge that single-stage detectors often fail to resolve. To address this issue, we propose SeNeDiF-OOD, a novel methodology based on Semantic Nested Dichotomy Fusion. This framework decomposes the detection task into a hierarchical structure of binary fusion nodes, where each layer is designed to integrate decision boundaries aligned with specific levels of semantic abstraction. To validate the proposed framework, we present a comprehensive case study using MonuMAI, a real-world architectural style recognition system exposed to an open environment. This application faces a diverse range of inputs, including non-monument images, unknown architectural styles, and adversarial attacks, making it an ideal testbed for our proposal. Through extensive experimental evaluation in this domain, results demonstrate that our hierarchical fusion methodology significantly outperforms traditional baselines, effectively filtering these diverse OOD categories while preserving in-distribution performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSeNeDiF-OOD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5957\u4e8c\u5206\u878d\u5408\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u89e3\u51b3OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5f02\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728MonuMAI\u5efa\u7b51\u98ce\u683c\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u662fAI\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u53ef\u9760\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u4ece\u4f4e\u7ea7\u635f\u574f\u5230\u8bed\u4e49\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u5f02\u8d28OOD\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSeNeDiF-OOD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u878d\u5408\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6bcf\u5c42\u96c6\u6210\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u7ea7\u522b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728MonuMAI\u5efa\u7b51\u98ce\u683c\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8fc7\u6ee4\u591a\u6837OOD\u7c7b\u522b\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5957\u4e8c\u5206\u878d\u5408\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754cAI\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In the second phase, key terms are extracted and relevant images are generated using advanced models such as CLIP and diffusion models to enhance visual quality and semantic alignment. In the final phase, the generated images are synthesized into a video format, integrated with either pre-recorded or synthesized sound, resulting in a fully interactive educational video. The proposed system is compared with other systems such as TGAN, MoCoGAN, and TGANS-C, achieving a Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) score of 28.75%, which indicates improved visual quality and better over existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eGAN\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5408\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u6559\u80b2\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u6216\u8bed\u97f3\u751f\u6210\u6559\u80b2\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u6280\u672f\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u5df2\u6709\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4f46\u9488\u5bf9\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4ecd\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc(GAN)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1)\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u8f6c\u5f55\u8f93\u5165\uff1b2)\u63d0\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528CLIP\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b3)\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u5f55\u5236\u6216\u5408\u6210\u97f3\u9891\u3002", "result": "\u4e0eTGAN\u3001MoCoGAN\u3001TGANS-C\u7b49\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u83b7\u5f9728.75%\u7684FID\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eGAN\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u6216\u8bed\u97f3\u8f93\u5165\u521b\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u6559\u80b2\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Integrating these inherently distinct yet complementary data sources is essential for uncovering the cross-modal patterns that drive behavioral phenotypes. However, effective integration is hindered by the high dimensionality and non-linearity of connectome data, complex non-linear SC-FC coupling, and the challenge of disentangling shared information from modality-specific variations. To address these issues, we propose the Cross-Modal Joint-Individual Variational Network (CM-JIVNet), a unified probabilistic framework designed to learn factorized latent representations from paired SC-FC datasets. Our model utilizes a multi-head attention fusion module to capture non-linear cross-modal dependencies while isolating independent, modality-specific signals. Validated on Human Connectome Project Young Adult (HCP-YA) data, CM-JIVNet demonstrates superior performance in cross-modal reconstruction and behavioral trait prediction.

This work studies moral robustness in VLMs, defined as the ability to preserve moral judgments under textual and visual perturbations that do not alter the underlying moral context. We systematically probe VLMs with a diverse set of model-agnostic multimodal perturbations and find that their moral stances are highly fragile, frequently flipping under simple manipulations. Our analysis reveals systematic vulnerabilities across perturbation types, moral domains, and model scales, including a sycophancy trade-off where stronger instruction-following models are more susceptible to persuasion. We further show that lightweight inference-time interventions can partially restore moral stability.

Unlike conventional video (RGB with stereo/mono audio), our video stream provides a spatially grounded visualization of sound intensity across a scene, offering a new and powerful dimension of perceptual understanding. Our real-time pipeline uses low-cost beamforming microphone arrays that are already common in smart speakers and increasingly present in robotics and XR headsets, yet this sensing capability remains unutilized for scene understanding. To assess the value of spatial acoustic information, we constructed an evaluation set of 402 question-answer scenes, comparing a state-of-the-art VLM given conventional video with and without paired acoustic field video. Results show a clear and consistent improvement when incorporating spatial acoustic data; the VLM we test improves from 38.3% correct to 67.4%. Our findings highlight that many everyday scene understanding tasks remain underconstrained when relying solely on visual and audio input, and that acoustic field data provides a promising and practical direction for multimodal reasoning.

However, most existing methods have not employed standardized datasets, and their evaluations rely on traditional image quality (IQ) metrics that may lack clinical relevance. The absence of a standardized framework for clinically meaningful IQ assessment hinders fair comparison and raises concerns about the reproducibility and reliability of reported advancements in PACT. A benchmarking framework is proposed that provides open-source, anatomically plausible synthetic datasets and evaluation strategies for DL-based acoustic inversion methods in PACT. The datasets each include over 11,000 two-dimensional (2D) stochastic breast objects with clinically relevant lesions and paired measurements at varying modeling complexity. The evaluation strategies incorporate both traditional and task-based IQ measures to assess fidelity and clinical utility. A preliminary benchmarking study is conducted to demonstrate the framework's utility by comparing DL-based and physics-based reconstruction methods. The benchmarking study demonstrated that the proposed framework enabled comprehensive, quantitative comparisons of reconstruction performance and revealed important limitations in certain DL-based methods. Although they performed well according to traditional IQ measures, they often failed to accurately recover lesions. This highlights the inadequacy of traditional metrics and motivates the need for task-based assessments. The proposed benchmarking framework enables systematic comparisons of DL-based acoustic inversion methods for 2D PACT. By integrating clinically relevant synthetic datasets with rigorous evaluation protocols, it enables reproducible, objective assessments and facilitates method development and system optimization in PACT.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5149\u58f0\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u65ad\u5c42\u626b\u63cf\uff08PACT\uff09\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u58f0\u5b66\u53cd\u6f14\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5f00\u6e90\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dPACT\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6307\u6807\u53ef\u80fd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5173\u4e8ePACT\u62a5\u544a\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f00\u6e90\u3001\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u8fc711,000\u4e2a\u4e8c\u7ef4\u968f\u673a\u4e73\u817a\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u75c5\u53d8\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6548\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5168\u9762\u3001\u5b9a\u91cf\u5730\u6bd4\u8f83\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u67d0\u4e9b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6062\u590d\u75c5\u53d8\uff0c\u8fd9\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf92D PACT\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u58f0\u5b66\u53cd\u6f14\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u5b83\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u3001\u5ba2\u89c2\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdbPACT\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

At the same time, the rapidly increasing energetic cost of training large models raises the question of whether learning algorithms approach any fundamental efficiency bound. In this work, we propose a unifying theoretical framework connecting thermodynamic optimality, information geometry, and regularization.\n  Under three explicit assumptions -- (A1) that optimality requires an intrinsic, parametrization-invariant measure of information, (A2) that belief states are modeled by maximum-entropy distributions under known constraints, and (A3) that optimal processes are quasi-static -- we prove a conditional optimality theorem. Specifically, the Fisher--Rao metric is the unique admissible geometry on belief space, and thermodynamically optimal regularization corresponds to minimizing squared Fisher--Rao distance to a reference state.\n  We derive the induced geometries for Gaussian and circular belief models, yielding hyperbolic and von Mises manifolds, respectively, and show that classical regularization schemes are structurally incapable of guaranteeing thermodynamic optimality. We introduce a notion of thermodynamic efficiency of learning and propose experimentally testable predictions.

While semi-supervised learning (SSL) is commonly used for fetal US image analysis, existing SSL methods typically rely on random limited selection, which can lead to suboptimal model performance by overfitting to homogeneous labeled data. To address this, we propose a two-stage Active Learning (AL) sampler, Entropy-Guided Agreement-Diversity (EGAD), for fetal head segmentation. Our method first selects the most uncertain samples using predictive entropy, and then refines the final selection using the agreement-diversity score combining cosine similarity and mutual information. Additionally, our SSL framework employs a consistency learning strategy with feature downsampling to further enhance segmentation performance. In experiments, SSL-EGAD achieves an average Dice score of 94.57\\% and 96.32\\% on two public datasets for fetal head segmentation, using 5\\% and 10\\% labeled data for training, respectively. Our method outperforms current SSL models and showcases consistent robustness across diverse pregnancy stage data.

To address these challenges, we propose SpatialMath, a novel Spatial Comprehension-Infused Symbolic Reasoning Framework designed to integrate spatial representations into structured symbolic reasoning chains. SpatialMath employs a specialized perception module to extract spatially-grounded representations from visual diagrams, capturing critical geometric structures and spatial relationships. These representations are then methodically infused into symbolic reasoning chains, facilitating visual comprehension-aware structured reasoning. To this end, we introduce MATHVERSE-PLUS, a novel dataset containing structured visual interpretations and step-by-step reasoning paths for vision-intensive mathematical problems. SpatialMath significantly outperforms strong multimodal baselines, achieving up to 10 percentage points improvement over supervised fine-tuning with data augmentation in vision-intensive settings.

DIC is based on optical images taken during experimentation and post-test image processing. Its advantages include the capability to capture full-field deformation in a non-contact manner, the robustness in characterizing excessive deformation induced by events such as yielding and cracking, and the versatility to integrate optical cameras with a variety of open-source and commercial codes. In this paper, we developed a new paradigm of DIC analysis by integrating camera control into the DIC process flow. The essential idea is to dynamically increase the camera imaging frame rate with excessive deformation or deformation rate, while maintaining a relatively low imaging frame rate with small and slow deformation. We refer to this new DIC paradigm as in-situ on-demand (ISOD) DIC. ISOD DIC enables real-time deformation analysis, visualization, and closed-loop camera control. ISOD DIC has captured approximately 178% more images than conventional DIC for samples undergoing crack growth due to its dynamically adjusted frame rate, with the potential to significantly enhance data richness for damage inspection without consuming excessive storage space and analysis time, thereby benefiting the characterization of intrinsic constitutive behaviors and damage mechanisms", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6570\u5b57\u56fe\u50cf\u76f8\u5173\uff08DIC\uff09\u5206\u6790\u8303\u5f0f\u2014\u2014\u539f\u4f4d\u6309\u9700\uff08ISOD\uff09DIC\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u76f8\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u96c6\u6210\u5230DIC\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u53d8\u5f62\u7a0b\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6210\u50cf\u5e27\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfDIC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e27\u7387\u6210\u50cf\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u5f53\u6750\u6599\u7ecf\u5386\u5c48\u670d\u3001\u5f00\u88c2\u7b49\u5927\u53d8\u5f62\u65f6\uff0c\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e27\u7387\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u5173\u952e\u53d8\u5f62\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u800c\u5c0f\u53d8\u5f62\u65f6\u53c8\u53ef\u80fd\u6d6a\u8d39\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u5206\u6790\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86ISOD DIC\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u76f8\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u96c6\u6210\u5230DIC\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u601d\u60f3\u662f\u6839\u636e\u53d8\u5f62\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u53d8\u5f62\u901f\u7387\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u76f8\u673a\u6210\u50cf\u5e27\u7387\uff1a\u5728\u5927\u53d8\u5f62\u6216\u9ad8\u53d8\u5f62\u901f\u7387\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e27\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f\u800c\u6162\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u5e27\u7387\u3002", "result": "ISOD DIC\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u53d8\u5f62\u5206\u6790\u3001\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u95ed\u73af\u76f8\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u5728\u88c2\u7eb9\u6269\u5c55\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfDIC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cISOD DIC\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7ea6178%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u635f\u4f24\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6d88\u8017\u5b58\u50a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5206\u6790\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "ISOD DIC\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5e27\u7387\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6d88\u8017\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53d8\u5f62\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8868\u5f81\u6750\u6599\u672c\u6784\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u635f\u4f24\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u6d4b\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

ME-WARD is designed to process joint angle data from motion capture systems, including inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based setups, and deep learning human body pose tracking models. The tool's flexibility enables ergonomic risk assessment using any system capable of reliably measuring joint angles, extending the applicability of RULA beyond proprietary setups. To validate its performance, the tool was tested in an industrial setting during the assembly of conveyor belts, which involved high-risk tasks such as inserting rods and pushing conveyor belt components. The experiments leveraged gold standard IMU systems alongside a state-of-the-art monocular 3D pose estimation system. The results confirmed that ME-WARD produces reliable RULA scores that closely align with IMU-derived metrics for flexion-dominated movements and comparable performance with the monocular system, despite limitations in tracking lateral and rotational motions. This work highlights the potential of integrating multiple motion capture technologies into a unified and accessible ergonomic assessment pipeline. By supporting diverse input sources, including low-cost video-based systems, the proposed multimodal approach offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for ergonomic assessments, paving the way for broader adoption in resource-constrained industrial environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "ME-WARD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5de5\u6548\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5904\u7406\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0RULA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301IMU\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u59ff\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5de5\u6548\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u6709\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1ME-WARD\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0RULA\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u6765\u81eaIMU\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5173\u8282\u89d2\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u3002\u5728\u4f20\u9001\u5e26\u88c5\u914d\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u91d1\u6807\u51c6IMU\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5355\u76ee3D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "ME-WARD\u4ea7\u751f\u7684RULA\u5206\u6570\u4e0eIMU\u884d\u751f\u6307\u6807\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5c48\u66f2\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\uff09\uff0c\u4e0e\u5355\u76ee\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5982\u63d2\u5165\u6746\u4ef6\u548c\u63a8\u52a8\u4f20\u9001\u5e26\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4fa7\u5411\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ME-WARD\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u6280\u672f\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u5de5\u6548\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u652f\u6301\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u89c6\u9891\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u8f93\u5165\u6e90\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u5de5\u6548\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

To examine whether AI models can understand such signals in human cultural contexts, we introduce AVMeme Exam, a human-curated benchmark of over one thousand iconic Internet sounds and videos spanning speech, songs, music, and sound effects. Each meme is paired with a unique Q&A assessing levels of understanding from surface content to context and emotion to usage and world knowledge, along with metadata such as original year, transcript, summary, and sensitivity. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) alongside human participants using this benchmark. Our results reveal a consistent limitation: current models perform poorly on textless music and sound effects, and struggle to think in context and in culture compared to surface content. These findings highlight a key gap in human-aligned multimodal intelligence and call for models that can perceive contextually and culturally beyond the surface of what they hear and see.

The architecture integrates a diffusion-based denoising module to suppress environmental noise while preserving Bangla-specific phonetic cues, and a contextual cross-attention module that conditions recognition on speaker embeddings for robustness across gender, age, and dialects. Trained end-to-end with a composite objective combining CTC loss, phonetic consistency, and speaker alignment, BanglaRobustNet achieves substantial reductions in word error rate (WER) and character error rate (CER) compared to Wav2Vec-BERT and Whisper baselines.

We introduce a novel pipeline grounded in semiotic theory that leverages large language models and text-to-image models to generate metonymic visual representations. Using this framework, we construct ViMET, the first visual metonymy dataset comprising 2,000 multiple-choice questions to evaluate the cognitive reasoning abilities in multimodal language models.

Despite rapid progresses, there lacks fair and comprehensive comparisons of existing EEG foundation models, due to inconsistent pre-training objectives, preprocessing choices, and downstream evaluation protocols. This paper fills this gap. We first review 50 representative models and organize their design choices into a unified taxonomic framework including data standardization, model architectures, and self-supervised pre-training strategies. We then evaluate 12 open-source foundation models and competitive specialist baselines across 13 EEG datasets spanning nine BCI paradigms. Emphasizing real-world deployments, we consider both cross-subject generalization under a leave-one-subject-out protocol and rapid calibration under a within-subject few-shot setting. We further compare full-parameter fine-tuning with linear probing to assess the transferability of pre-trained representations, and examine the relationship between model scale and downstream performance. Our results indicate that: 1) linear probing is frequently insufficient; 2) specialist models trained from scratch remain competitive across many tasks; and, 3) larger foundation models do not necessarily yield better generalization performance under current data regimes and training practices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5bf9EEG\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e8612\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u572813\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u4e13\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3001\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "EEG\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u53d1\u5c55\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u516c\u5e73\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u56de\u987e50\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8bc4\u4f3012\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u4e13\u4e1a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u572813\u4e2aEEG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u91c7\u7528\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u7559\u4e00\u6cd5\u548c\u88ab\u8bd5\u5185\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u4e24\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\uff1b2\uff09\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4ecd\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff1b3\uff09\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0b\uff0c\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "EEG\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u9886\u57df\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While recent works have accelerated inference via KV cache reuse or heuristic decoding, they overlook the intrinsic inefficiencies within the block-wise diffusion process. Specifically, they suffer from spatial redundancy by modeling informative-sparse suffix regions uniformly and temporal inefficiency by applying fixed denoising schedules across all the decoding process. To address this, we propose Streaming-dLLM, a training-free framework that streamlines inference across both spatial and temporal dimensions. Spatially, we introduce attenuation guided suffix modeling to approximate the full context by pruning redundant mask tokens. Temporally, we employ a dynamic confidence aware strategy with an early exit mechanism, allowing the model to skip unnecessary iterations for converged tokens. Extensive experiments show that Streaming-dLLM achieves up to 68.2X speedup while maintaining generation quality, highlighting its effectiveness in diffusion decoding.

Forgetting and regularization are not heuristic add-ons but structural requirements for adaptive systems. Drawing on information theory, thermodynamics, and information geometry, we introduce the BEDS (Bayesian Emergent Dissipative Structures) framework, modeling learning as the evolution of compressed belief states under dissipation constraints.\n  A central contribution is the Conditional Optimality Theorem, showing that Fisher-Rao regularization measuring change via information divergence rather than Euclidean distance is the unique thermodynamically optimal regularization strategy, achieving minimal dissipation. Euclidean regularization is shown to be structurally suboptimal. The framework unifies existing methods (Ridge, SIGReg, EMA, SAC) as special cases of a single governing equation.\n  Within this view, overfitting corresponds to over-crystallization, while catastrophic forgetting reflects insufficient dissipation control. The framework distinguishes BEDS-crystallizable problems, where beliefs converge to stable equilibria, from BEDS-maintainable problems, which require continual adaptation. It extends naturally to continual and multi-agent systems, where viability, stability under adaptation and finite resources replaces asymptotic optimality as the primary criterion.

We present a computational methodology for systematically exploring and analyzing the relationships among convergence, pruning, and quantization. The workflow first performs a structured design sweep across a large set of architectures, then evaluates convergence behavior, pruning sensitivity, and quantization robustness on representative models. Focusing on well-known image classification of increasing complexity, and across Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Vision Transformers, our initial results show that, despite architectural diversity, performance is largely invariant and learning dynamics consistently exhibit three regimes: unstable, learning, and overfitting. We further characterize the minimal learnable parameters required for stable learning, uncover distinct convergence and pruning phases, and quantify the effect of reduced numeric precision on trainable parameters. Aligning with intuition, the results confirm that deeper architectures are more resilient to pruning than shallower ones, with parameter redundancy as high as 60%, and quantization impacts models with fewer learnable parameters more severely and has a larger effect on harder image datasets. These findings provide actionable guidance for selecting compact, stable models under pruning and low-precision constraints in image classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7d22\u6536\u655b\u3001\u526a\u679d\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c3d\u7ba1\u67b6\u6784\u591a\u6837\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u57fa\u672c\u4e0d\u53d8\u4e14\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u5448\u73b0\u4e09\u4e2a\u7a33\u5b9a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u526a\u679d\u548c\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7f51\u7edc\u64c5\u957f\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4f46\u786e\u5b9a\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u67b6\u6784\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7d22\u6536\u655b\u3001\u526a\u679d\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u7d27\u51d1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u526a\u679d\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9012\u589e\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728DNN\u3001CNN\u548cViT\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u67b6\u6784\u591a\u6837\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u57fa\u672c\u4e0d\u53d8\uff1b\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u5448\u73b0\u4e09\u4e2a\u7a33\u5b9a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u67b6\u6784\u6bd4\u6d45\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u526a\u679d\u66f4\u5177\u97e7\u6027\uff08\u53c2\u6570\u5197\u4f59\u9ad8\u8fbe60%\uff09\uff1b\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u8f83\u5c11\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u5bf9\u66f4\u96be\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u526a\u679d\u548c\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u9009\u62e9\u7d27\u51d1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u666e\u904d\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002"}}

Our approach enhances traditional DQAS with a lightweight Classical Noise Layer applied before quantum processing, enabling simultaneous optimization of gate selection and noise parameters. This design preserves the quantum circuit's integrity while introducing trainable perturbations that enhance robustness without compromising standard performance. Experimental validation on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR datasets shows consistent improvements in both clean and adversarial accuracy compared to existing quantum architecture search methods. Under various attack scenarios, including Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Basic Iterative Method (BIM), and Momentum Iterative Method (MIM), and under realistic quantum noise conditions, our hybrid framework maintains superior performance.

Our core contribution is to formulate this as a tractable black-box optimization problem. We parameterize the hand's motion using a low-dimensional, spline-based representation built on sparse temporal keyframes. This allows us to use a powerful gradient-free optimizer, CMA-ES, to treat the high-fidelity physics engine as a black-box objective function. Our method finds motions that simultaneously maximize physical success (e.g., stable grasp and lift) while minimizing deviation from the original human demonstration.\n  Compared to MANIPTRANS-recent transfer pipelines, our approach achieves lower hand and object pose errors during replay and more accurately recovers hand-object physical interactions.

Here, we present a compact and cost-effective lensfree holography platform integrated with deep learning for automated HER2 scoring of immunohistochemically stained breast tissue sections. The system captures lensfree diffraction patterns of stained HER2 tissue sections under RGB laser illumination and acquires complex field information over a sample area of ~1,250 mm^2 at an effective throughput of ~84 mm^2 per minute. To enhance diagnostic reliability, we incorporated an uncertainty quantification strategy based on Bayesian Monte Carlo dropout, which provides autonomous uncertainty estimates for each prediction and supports reliable, robust HER2 scoring, with an overall correction rate of 30.4%. Using a blinded test set of 412 unique tissue samples, our approach achieved a testing accuracy of 84.9% for 4-class (0, 1+, 2+, 3+) HER2 classification and 94.8% for binary (0/1+ vs. 2+/3+) HER2 scoring with uncertainty quantification. Overall, this lensfree holography approach provides a practical pathway toward portable, high-throughput, and cost-effective HER2 scoring, particularly suited for resource-limited settings, where traditional digital pathology infrastructure is unavailable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u900f\u955c\u81ea\u7531\u5168\u606f\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5207\u7247HER2\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u73af\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "HER2\u8868\u8fbe\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u9884\u540e\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u9009\u62e9\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u5b57HER2\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b28\u91cd\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u900f\u955c\u81ea\u7531\u5168\u606f\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5728RGB\u6fc0\u5149\u7167\u660e\u4e0b\u6355\u83b7\u67d3\u8272HER2\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5207\u7247\u7684\u884d\u5c04\u56fe\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1bdropout\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728412\u4e2a\u72ec\u7279\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6837\u672c\u7684\u76f2\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c4\u7c7bHER2\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe84.9%\uff0c\u4e8c\u5143HER2\u8bc4\u5206\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe94.8%\uff0c\u603b\u4f53\u6821\u6b63\u7387\u4e3a30.4%\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u901a\u91cf\u7ea684 mm\u00b2/\u5206\u949f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u900f\u955c\u81ea\u7531\u5168\u606f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4fbf\u643a\u3001\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u3001\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u7684HER2\u8bc4\u5206\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u5b57\u75c5\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

Modern day VLMs have made tremendous progress in image understanding but they struggle when it comes to understanding technical diagrams. One way to overcome this problem is to fine-tune on real world hand-drawn images, but it is not practically possible to generate large number of such images. In this paper, we introduce a large synthetically generated corpus (reflective of real world images) for training VLMs and subsequently evaluate VLMs on a smaller corpus of hand-drawn images (with the help of humans). We introduce several new self-supervision tasks for training and perform extensive experiments with various baseline models and fine-tune Llama 3.2 11B-instruct model on synthetic images on these tasks to obtain LLama-VL-TUG, which significantly improves the ROUGE-L performance of Llama 3.2 11B-instruct by 2.14x and achieves the best all-round performance across all baseline models.

Beyond simple label prediction, robust affective reasoning must synthesize fine-grained signals such as facial micro-expressions and prosodic which shifts to decode the latent causality within complex social contexts. However, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) face significant limitations in fine-grained perception, primarily due to data scarcity and insufficient cross-modal fusion. As a result, these models often exhibit unimodal dominance which leads to hallucinations in complex multimodal interactions, particularly when visual and acoustic cues are subtle, ambiguous, or even contradictory (e.g., in sarcastic scenery). To address this, we introduce SABER-LLM, a framework designed for robust multimodal reasoning. First, we construct SABER, a large-scale emotion reasoning dataset comprising 600K video clips, annotated with a novel six-dimensional schema that jointly captures audiovisual cues and causal logic. Second, we propose the structured evidence decomposition paradigm, which enforces a \"perceive-then-reason\" separation between evidence extraction and reasoning to alleviate unimodal dominance. The ability to perceive complex scenes is further reinforced by consistency-aware direct preference optimization, which explicitly encourages alignment among modalities under ambiguous or conflicting perceptual conditions. Experiments on EMER, EmoBench-M, and SABER-Test demonstrate that SABER-LLM significantly outperforms open-source baselines and achieves robustness competitive with closed-source models in decoding complex emotional dynamics.

In this work, based on the prominent Whisper ASR, first, we propose a simple and effective visual fusion method -- use of visual features both in encoder and decoder (dual-use) -- to learn the audiovisual interactions in the encoder and to weigh modalities in the decoder. Second, we compare visual fusion methods in Whisper models of various sizes. Our proposed dual-use method shows consistent noise robustness improvement, e.g., a 35% relative improvement (WER: 4.41% vs. 6.83%) based on Whisper small, and a 57% relative improvement (WER: 4.07% vs. 9.53%) based on Whisper medium, compared to typical reference middle fusion in babble noise with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 0dB. Third, we conduct ablation studies examining the impact of various module designs and fusion options. Fine-tuned on 1929 hours of audiovisual data, our dual-use method using Whisper medium achieves 4.08% (MUSAN babble noise) and 4.43% (NoiseX babble noise) average WER across various SNRs, thereby establishing a new state-of-the-art in noisy conditions on the LRS3 AV-ASR benchmark.

Although CLIP-based losses effectively align modalities at the semantic level, the resulting latent spaces often remain only partially shared, revealing a structural mismatch known as the modality gap. While the necessity of addressing this phenomenon remains debated, particularly given its limited impact on instance-wise tasks (e.g., retrieval), we prove that its influence is instead strongly pronounced in group-level tasks (e.g., clustering). To support this claim, we introduce a novel method designed to consistently reduce this discrepancy in two-modal settings, with a straightforward extension to the general $n$-modal case. Through our extensive evaluation, we demonstrate our novel insight: while reducing the gap provides only marginal or inconsistent improvements in traditional instance-wise tasks, it significantly enhances group-wise tasks. These findings may reshape our understanding of the modality gap, highlighting its key role in improving performance on tasks requiring semantic grouping.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\uff08modality gap\uff09\u5bf9\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u805a\u7c7b\uff09\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u68c0\u7d22\uff09\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u9650\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "CLIP\u7b49\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u9762\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f80\u5f80\u53ea\u662f\u90e8\u5206\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8fd9\u79cd\u95f4\u9699\u5bf9\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u5bf9\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6301\u7eed\u51cf\u5c11\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u4ee5\u7b80\u5355\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e00\u822c\u7684n\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u4ec5\u5e26\u6765\u8fb9\u9645\u6216\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u805a\u7c7b\uff09\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u8fd9\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u7ec4\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5728\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6bd4\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u66f4\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u80fd\u91cd\u5851\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5176\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u9700\u8981\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u7ec4\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Effective reasoning, therefore, hinges on knowing which tools to use, when to invoke them, and how to compose them over multiple steps, even when faced with new tools or new tasks. We introduce \\textbf{AdaReasoner}, a family of multimodal models that learn tool use as a general reasoning skill rather than as tool-specific or explicitly supervised behavior. AdaReasoner is enabled by (i) a scalable data curation pipeline exposing models to long-horizon, multi-step tool interactions; (ii) Tool-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes tool selection and sequencing based on end-task success; and (iii) an adaptive learning mechanism that dynamically regulates tool usage. Together, these components allow models to infer tool utility from task context and intermediate outcomes, enabling coordination of multiple tools and generalization to unseen tools. Empirically, AdaReasoner exhibits strong tool-adaptive and generalization behaviors: it autonomously adopts beneficial tools, suppresses irrelevant ones, and adjusts tool usage frequency based on task demands, despite never being explicitly trained to do so. These capabilities translate into state-of-the-art performance across challenging benchmarks, improving the 7B base model by +24.9\\% on average and surpassing strong proprietary systems such as GPT-5 on multiple tasks, including VSP and Jigsaw.", "AI": {"tldr": "AdaReasoner\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7279\u5b9a\u5de5\u5177\u6216\u663e\u5f0f\u76d1\u7763\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5de5\u5177\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u8d85\u51fa\u81ea\u8eab\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u4f1a\u4f7f\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\u77e5\u9053\u4f7f\u7528\u54ea\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u3001\u4f55\u65f6\u8c03\u7528\u5b83\u4eec\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u7ec4\u5408\u5b83\u4eec\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u9762\u5bf9\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u6216\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u4e5f\u662f\u5982\u6b64\u3002", "method": "1) \u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u63a5\u89e6\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u3001\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b2) Tool-GRPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u7ec8\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b3) \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u9891\u7387\u3002", "result": "AdaReasoner\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1a\u80fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u91c7\u7528\u6709\u76ca\u5de5\u5177\u3001\u6291\u5236\u65e0\u5173\u5de5\u5177\u3001\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u8c03\u6574\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4ece\u672a\u88ab\u663e\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\u3002\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c7B\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534724.9%\uff0c\u5728VSP\u548cJigsaw\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8aGPT-5\u7b49\u5f3a\u5927\u4e13\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "AdaReasoner\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5de5\u5177\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3aMLLMs\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Many existing models incorporate the simulation mesh as an additional input, thereby reducing prediction errors. However, generating a simulation mesh for new geometries is computationally costly. In contrast, mesh-free methods, which do not rely on the simulation mesh, typically incur higher errors. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce SMART, a neural surrogate model that predicts physical quantities at arbitrary query locations using only a point-cloud representation of the geometry, without requiring access to the simulation mesh. The geometry and simulation parameters are encoded into a shared latent space that captures both structural and parametric characteristics of the physical field. A physics decoder then attends to the encoder's intermediate latent representations to map spatial queries to physical quantities. Through this cross-layer interaction, the model jointly updates latent geometric features and the evolving physical field.

As the field transitions toward more complex task scenarios, multi-agent system frameworks are becoming essential for achieving scalable, efficient, and collaborative solutions. This shift is fueled by three primary factors: increasing agent capabilities, enhancing system efficiency through task delegation, and enabling advanced human-agent interactions. To address the challenges posed by multi-agent collaboration, we propose the Multi-Agent Robotic System (MARS) Challenge, held at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on SpaVLE. The competition focuses on two critical areas: planning and control, where participants explore multi-agent embodied planning using vision-language models (VLMs) to coordinate tasks and policy execution to perform robotic manipulation in dynamic environments. By evaluating solutions submitted by participants, the challenge provides valuable insights into the design and coordination of embodied multi-agent systems, contributing to the future development of advanced collaborative AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MARS\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7NeurIPS 2025\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u63a8\u52a8\u5177\u8eabAI\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5177\u8eabAI\u5411\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u5927\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\uff1a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u59d4\u6d3e\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u589e\u5f3a\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u6311\u6218\u6765\u63a8\u52a8\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMARS\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u4f5c\u4e3aNeurIPS 2025 SpaVLE\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5177\u8eab\u89c4\u5212\u4ee5\u534f\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b2) \u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u53c2\u8d5b\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5177\u8eab\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9d\u8d35\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u8d5b\u65b9\u6848\u8bc4\u4f30\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u534f\u4f5cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "MARS\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u6210\u529f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u9ad8\u7ea7\u534f\u4f5cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u505a\u51fa\u4e86\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u5177\u8eab\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}
