For\nlarge-scale magnetic fields, however, their strength and length scale may not\nnecessarily originate from a singular primordial mechanism, namely inflationary\nmagnetogenesis, which has been a popular consideration in the literature. In\nthis paper, we propose a minimal scenario wherein a large-scale magnetic field\nis generated from the inflationary perturbation without any non-conformal\ncoupling. Due to their origin in the inflationary scalar spectrum, these\nprimordial fields are inherently weak, with their strength suppressed by the\nsmall amplitude of scalar fluctuations. We then consider the coupling between\nthis large-scale weak primordial magnetic field and a light axion of mass\n$<10^{-28}$ eV, which is assumed to be frozen in a misaligned state until the\nphoton decoupling. After the decoupling, when the universe enters into a dark\nage, the light axion coherently oscillates. By appropriately tuning the\naxion-photon coupling parameter $\\alpha$, we demonstrate that a large-scale\nmagnetic field of sufficient strength can indeed be generated through tachyonic\nresonance. We further show that the produced magnetic field induces a unique\nspectrum with multiple peaks of secondary gravitational waves, which the\nupcoming CMB-S4 can probe through B-mode polarization. The strength can be\nsufficient enough to violate the PLANCK bound on tensor-to-scalar ratio $r\n\\lesssim 0.036$. Such a violation leads to a constraint on $\\alpha \\lesssim\n80$.

In particular, we aim to determine how different amounts\nof viscosity affect the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI), turbulence\nevolution, and the efficiency of gas mixing and cooling. Using idealized 2D\nnumerical setups, we compute the critical viscosity required to suppress the\nKHI in shear flows characterized by different density contrasts and Mach\nnumbers. These results are then used in a 3D shear layer setup to explore the\nimpact of viscosity on cooling efficiency and turbulence across different\ncooling regimes.

However, in the strong\ncooling regime, when cooling timescales are shorter than viscous timescales,\nkey scaling relations in TRMLs remain largely intact. In this regime -- which\nmust hold for gas to remain multiphase -- radiative losses dominate, and the\nsystem effectively behaves as non-viscous regardless of the actual level of\nviscosity. Our findings have direct implications for both the interpretation of\nobservational diagnostics and the development of subgrid models in large-scale\nsimulations."}

Within a minimal type-I seesaw extension of the Standard\nModel (SM), we explore the conditions under which the population of thermally\nproduced RHNs remain long-lived and cause a period of matter-domination. We\nfind that the suppression of the GW spectrum occurs above a characteristic\nfrequency determined by the RHN mass and active-sterile mixing. For RHN masses\nin the range $0.1$ - $10$ GeV and mixing $10^{-12} \\lesssim |V_{eN}|^2 \\lesssim\n10^{-5}$, we estimate such characteristic frequencies and the signal-to-noise\nratio to assess the detection prospects in GW observatories such as THEIA,\n$\\mu$-ARES, LISA, BBO and ET. We find complementarity between GW signals and\nlaboratory searches in SHiP, DUNE and LEGEND-1000. Notably, RHN masses of $0.2$\n- $2$ GeV and mixing $10^{-10} \\lesssim |V_{eN}|^2 \\lesssim 10^{-7}$ are\ntestable in both laboratory experiments and GW observations. Additionally, GW\nexperiments can probe the canonical seesaw regime of light neutrino mass\ngeneration, a region largely inaccessible to laboratory searches."}

We study\nthe warm multi natural inflation scenario with both linear and cubic\ndissipation coefficients. The model is motivated by axion-like inflation models\nwith coupling to non-Abelian gauge fields through a dimension five coupling and\ndissipation originating from sphaleron decay in a thermal bath. Both cases of\ndissipation coefficients can be compatible with current observations. In the\ncase of the cubic dissipation coefficient, we find that the curvature\nperturbation starts to grow suddenly when a transition from a weak dissipation\nto a strong dissipation regime occurs at the later stage of the inflation. We\nalso show that such rapid growth of the curvature perturbation on small scales\ngives rise to abundant scalar induced gravitational waves, which may be\ndetectable with future gravitational wave detectors such as DECIGO and ET. On\nthe other hand, there are also other parameter regions of the model, in the\nwarm inflation regime of weak to strong dissipation and with sub-Planckian\naxion decay constant, that can lead to overproduction of primordial black holes\non small scales, which are constrained by nucleosynthesis bounds, thus ruling\nout the model in this region of parameters."}

This allows their\nnon-ballistic propagation in magnetized structures to be captured. In certain\nsituations, a neutral cosmic ray component can arise. For example, cosmic ray\nneutrons are produced in considerable numbers through hadronic pp and p$\\gamma$\ninteractions. At ultrahigh energies, the decay timescales of these neutrons is\ndilated, allowing them to traverse distances on the scale of galactic and\ncosmological structures. Unlike charged cosmic rays, neutrons are not deflected\nby magnetic fields. They propagate ballistically at the speed of light in\nstraight lines. The presence of a neutral baryonic cosmic ray component formed\nin galaxies, clusters and cosmological filaments can facilitate the escape and\nleakage of cosmic rays from magnetic structures that would otherwise confine\nthem.

The snapshots span 11.65~Gyr of cosmic time, corresponding to the\nredshift range $0 \\le z \\le 3$. Using the comoving galaxy fields, voids were\nidentified via a well-tested, watershed transformation-based algorithm. Voids\nwere defined to be underdense regions that are unlikely to have arisen from\nPoisson noise, resulting in the selection of $\\sim100-200$ of the largest\nunderdense regions in each snapshot. At all redshifts, the radial density\nprofiles as traced by both the galaxies and the dark matter resemble inverse\ntop-hat functions. However, details of the functions (particularly the\nunderdensities of the innermost regions and the overdensities of the ridges)\nevolve considerably more for the dark matter density profiles than for the\ngalaxy density profiles. At all redshifts, a linear relationship between the\ngalaxy and dark matter density profiles exists, and the slope of the\nrelationship is similar to the bias estimates for \\texttt{TNG300} snapshots.\nLastly, we identify distinct environments in which voids can exist, defining\n``void-in-void\" and ``void-in-cloud\" populations (i.e., voids that reside in\nlarger underdense or overdense regions, respectively) and we investigate ways\nin which the relative densities of dark matter and galaxies in the interiors\nand ridges of these structures vary as a function of void environment."}

Submitted to A&A", "summary": "(Aims) Hot Dust Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs) are a population of\nhyper-luminous, heavily obscured quasars. Although nuclear obscurations close\nto Compton-thick are typical, a fraction show blue UV spectral energy\ndistributions consistent with unobscured quasar activity, albeit two orders of\nmagnitude fainter than expected from their mid-IR luminosity. The origin of the\nUV emission in these Blue excess Hot DOGs (BHDs) has been linked to scattered\nlight from the central engine. Here we study the properties of the UV emission\nin the BHD WISE J020446.13-050640.8 (W0204-0506). (Methods) We use imaging\npolarization observations in the $R_{\\rm Special}$ band obtained with the FORS2\ninstrument at VLT. We compare these data with radiative transfer simulations to\nconstrain the characteristics of the scattering material. (Results) We find a\nspatially integrated polarization fraction of $24.7\\pm 0.7$%, confirming the\nscattered-light nature of the UV emission of W0204-0506. The source is\nspatially resolved in the observations and we find a gradient in polarization\nfraction and angle that is aligned with the extended morphology of the source\nfound in HST/WFC3 imaging. A dusty, conical polar outflow starting at the AGN\nsublimation radius with a half-opening angle $\\lesssim 50~\\rm deg$ viewed at an\ninclination $\\gtrsim 45~\\rm deg$ can reproduce the observed polarization\nfraction if the dust is graphite-rich. We find that the gas mass and outflow\nvelocity are consistent with the range of values found for [OIII] outflows\nthrough spectroscopy in other Hot DOGs, though it is unclear whether the\noutflow is energetic enough to affect the long-term evolution of the host\ngalaxy. Our study highlights the unique potential for polarization imaging to\nstudy dusty quasar outflows, providing complementary constraints to those\nobtained through traditional spectroscopic studies."}
