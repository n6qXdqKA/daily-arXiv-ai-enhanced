Although recent deep architectures and large-scale datasets have\ndriven impressive closed-set performance, these models struggle to recognize or\nproperly segment objects outside their training classes.

In this\npaper, we propose a plug and play framework for O3S. By modeling the\nsegmentation pipeline as a conditional Markov chain, we derive a novel\nregularizer term dubbed Conditional Channel Capacity Maximization (3CM), that\nmaximizes the mutual information between features and predictions conditioned\non each class. When incorporated into standard loss functions, 3CM encourages\nthe encoder to retain richer, label-dependent features, thereby enhancing the\nnetwork's ability to distinguish and segment previously unseen categories.\nExperimental results demonstrate effectiveness of proposed method on detecting\nunseen objects.

While previous work has employed few-shot\nguidance to address this issue, existing methods still fail to capture and\ngenerate features unique to specific real images. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel dataset generation framework named LoFT, LoRA-Fused Training-data\nGeneration with Few-shot Guidance.

We evaluate the synthetic data produced by LoFT on\n10 datasets, using 8 to 64 real images per class as guidance and scaling up to\n1000 images per class. Our experiments show that training on LoFT-generated\ndata consistently outperforms other synthetic dataset methods, significantly\nincreasing accuracy as the dataset size increases.

Token reduction techniques that\ncompress models by sharing the denoising process among similar tokens have been\nintroduced.

However, these models\n(e.g., diffusion models (DMs)) typically require large amounts of fully sampled\n(clean) training data, which is often impractical in medical and scientific\nsettings such as dynamic imaging.\n  On the other hand, training-data-free approaches like the Deep Image Prior\n(DIP) do not require clean ground-truth images but suffer from noise\noverfitting and can be computationally expensive as the network parameters need\nto be optimized for each measurement set independently. Moreover, DIP-based\nmethods often overlook the potential of learning a prior using a small number\nof sub-sampled measurements (or degraded images) available during training. In\nthis paper, we propose UGoDIT, an Unsupervised Group DIP via Transferable\nweights, designed for the low-data regime where only a very small number, M, of\nsub-sampled measurement vectors are available during training.

While existing PO methods primarily\nconcentrate on producing favorable outputs, they often overlook the\nsignificance of classifier-free guidance (CFG) in mitigating undesirable\nresults. Diffusion-NPO addresses this gap by introducing negative preference\noptimization (NPO), training models to generate outputs opposite to human\npreferences and thereby steering them away from unfavorable outcomes. However,\nprior NPO approaches, including Diffusion-NPO, rely on costly and fragile\nprocedures for obtaining explicit preference annotations (e.g., manual pairwise\nlabeling or reward model training), limiting their practicality in domains\nwhere such data are scarce or difficult to acquire. In this work, we introduce\nSelf-NPO, a Negative Preference Optimization approach that learns exclusively\nfrom the model itself, thereby eliminating the need for manual data labeling or\nreward model training. Moreover, our method is highly efficient and does not\nrequire exhaustive data sampling.

Recently, approaches leveraging pre-trained models\nhave gained increasing popularity to mitigate this issue, due to the strong\ngeneralization ability of foundation models. To adjust pre-trained models for\nnew tasks, existing methods usually employ low-rank adaptation, which restricts\nparameter updates to a fixed low-rank subspace. However, constraining the\noptimization space inherently compromises the model's learning capacity,\nresulting in inferior performance.

These sequential\nsubspaces are dynamically determined through the singular value decomposition\nof gradients. CoSO updates the model by projecting gradients into these\nsubspaces, ensuring memory-efficient optimization.

Previous work in visual\nreasoning has primarily focused on reasoning segmentation, where models aim to\nsegment objects based on implicit text queries. This paper introduces reasoning\nvisual tasks (RVTs), a unified formulation that extends beyond traditional\nvideo reasoning segmentation to a diverse family of visual language reasoning\nproblems, which can therefore accommodate multiple output formats including\nbounding boxes, natural language descriptions, and question-answer pairs.\nCorrespondingly, we identify the limitations in current benchmark construction\nmethods that rely solely on large language models (LLMs), which inadequately\ncapture complex spatial-temporal relationships and multi-step reasoning chains\nin video due to their reliance on token representation, resulting in benchmarks\nwith artificially limited reasoning complexity.

Despite their\nimpressive capabilities, the robustness of these models under adversarial\nperturbations remains underexplored, which is a critical concern for\nsafety-sensitive applications. In this work, we present the first comprehensive\nstudy of adversarial vulnerability in unified multi-modal encoders. We find\nthat even mild adversarial perturbations lead to substantial performance drops\nacross all modalities.

This work has been submitted to the Elsevier for\n  possible publication", "summary": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely adopted technique for transferring\nknowledge from a high-capacity teacher model to a smaller student model by\naligning their output distributions. However, existing methods often\nunderperform in fine-grained visual recognition tasks, where distinguishing\nsubtle differences between visually similar classes is essential. This\nperformance gap stems from the fact that conventional approaches treat the\nteacher's output logits as a single, undifferentiated signal-assuming all\ncontained information is equally beneficial to the student. Consequently,\nstudent models may become overloaded with redundant signals and fail to capture\nthe teacher's nuanced decision boundaries. To address this issue, we propose\nFine-Grained Knowledge Distillation (FiGKD), a novel frequency-aware framework\nthat decomposes a model's logits into low-frequency (content) and\nhigh-frequency (detail) components using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT).\nFiGKD selectively transfers only the high-frequency components, which encode\nthe teacher's semantic decision patterns, while discarding redundant\nlow-frequency content already conveyed through ground-truth supervision. Our\napproach is simple, architecture-agnostic, and requires no access to\nintermediate feature maps. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet,\nand multiple fine-grained recognition benchmarks show that FiGKD consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art logit-based and feature-based distillation methods\nacross a variety of teacher-student configurations.

However, clinical\ndata for all modalities may not be available for every patient, creating a\nsignificant challenge. To address this, previous studies encode multiple\nmodalities into a shared latent space. While somewhat effective, it remains\nsuboptimal, as each modality contains distinct and valuable information. In\nthis study, we propose DC-Seg (Disentangled Contrastive Learning for\nSegmentation), a new method that explicitly disentangles images into\nmodality-invariant anatomical representation and modality-specific\nrepresentation, by using anatomical contrastive learning and modality\ncontrastive learning respectively. This solution improves the separation of\nanatomical and modality-specific features by considering the modality gaps,\nleading to more robust representations.

However, relying on manual prompts is impractical for real-world\napplications, particularly in scenarios where rapid prompt provision and\nresource efficiency are crucial. In this paper, we propose the Automation of\nPrompts for SAM (AoP-SAM), a novel approach that learns to generate essential\nprompts in optimal locations automatically. AoP-SAM enhances SAM's efficiency\nand usability by eliminating manual input, making it better suited for\nreal-world tasks. Our approach employs a lightweight yet efficient Prompt\nPredictor model that detects key entities across images and identifies the\noptimal regions for placing prompt candidates. This method leverages SAM's\nimage embeddings, preserving its zero-shot generalization capabilities without\nrequiring fine-tuning.

However, existing deep\nlearning-based whale detection methods usually require manually created,\nhigh-quality bounding box annotations, which are labor-intensive to produce.\nMoreover, existing studies often exclude ``uncertain whales'', individuals that\nhave ambiguous appearances in satellite imagery, limiting the applicability of\nthese models in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, this study\nintroduces an automated pipeline for detecting beluga whales and harp seals in\nVHR satellite imagery. The pipeline leverages point annotations and the Segment\nAnything Model (SAM) to generate precise bounding box annotations, which are\nused to train YOLOv8 for multiclass detection of certain whales, uncertain\nwhales, and harp seals. Experimental results demonstrated that SAM-generated\nannotations significantly improved detection performance, achieving higher\n$\\text{F}_\\text{1}$-scores compared to traditional buffer-based annotations.\nYOLOv8 trained on SAM-labeled boxes achieved an overall\n$\\text{F}_\\text{1}$-score of 72.2% for whales overall and 70.3% for harp seals,\nwith superior performance in dense scenes. The proposed approach not only\nreduces the manual effort required for annotation but also enhances the\ndetection of uncertain whales, offering a more comprehensive solution for\nmarine animal monitoring. This method holds great potential for extending to\nother species, habitats, and remote sensing platforms, as well as for\nestimating whale biometrics, thereby advancing ecological monitoring and\nconservation efforts.

While\nhigh-field MRI (HF-MRI) is standard in research and clinical settings, its\nlimited availability hinders widespread use. Low-field MRI (LF-MRI),\nparticularly portable systems, offers a cost-effective and accessible\nalternative. However, existing cortical surface analysis tools are optimized\nfor high-resolution HF-MRI and struggle with the lower signal-to-noise ratio\nand resolution of LF-MRI. In this work, we present a machine learning method\nfor 3D reconstruction and analysis of portable LF-MRI across a range of\ncontrasts and resolutions. Our method works \"out of the box\" without\nretraining. It uses a 3D U-Net trained on synthetic LF-MRI to predict signed\ndistance functions of cortical surfaces, followed by geometric processing to\nensure topological accuracy. We evaluate our method using paired HF/LF-MRI\nscans of the same subjects, showing that LF-MRI surface reconstruction accuracy\ndepends on acquisition parameters, including contrast type (T1 vs T2),\norientation (axial vs isotropic), and resolution. A 3mm isotropic T2-weighted\nscan acquired in under 4 minutes, yields strong agreement with HF-derived\nsurfaces: surface area correlates at r=0.96, cortical parcellations reach\nDice=0.98, and gray matter volume achieves r=0.93.

Although numerous Transformer-based enhancement\nmethods have achieved impressive performance, their computational and memory\ndemands hinder deployment on edge devices. Quantization offers a practical\nsolution by reducing the bit-width of weights and activations to improve\nefficiency. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to video\nenhancement tasks often leads to significant performance degradation and loss\nof fine details. This stems from two limitations: (a) inability to allocate\nvarying representational capacity across frames, which results in suboptimal\ndynamic range adaptation; (b) over-reliance on full-precision teachers, which\nlimits the learning of low-bit student models. To tackle these challenges, we\npropose a novel quantization method for video enhancement: Progressive\nMulti-Frame Quantization for Video Enhancement (PMQ-VE).

Remote sensing imagery exhibits substantial variability across\ntemporal, spectral, and spatial (TSS) dimensions, complicating unified data\nprocessing. Current deep learning models for dense prediction tasks, such as\nsemantic segmentation and change detection, are typically tailored to specific\ninput-output configurations. Consequently, variations in data dimensionality or\ntask requirements often lead to significant performance degradation or model\nincompatibility, necessitating costly retraining or fine-tuning efforts for\ndifferent application scenarios. This paper introduces the\nTemporal-Spectral-Spatial Unified Network (TSSUN), a novel architecture\ndesigned for unified representation and modeling of remote sensing data across\ndiverse TSS characteristics and task types. TSSUN employs a\nTemporal-Spectral-Spatial Unified Strategy that leverages meta-information to\ndecouple and standardize input representations from varied temporal, spectral,\nand spatial configurations, and similarly unifies output structures for\ndifferent dense prediction tasks and class numbers.

To bridge this gap, we introduce LogicOCR, a benchmark\ncomprising 1,100 multiple-choice questions designed to evaluate LMMs' logical\nreasoning abilities on text-rich images, while minimizing reliance on\ndomain-specific knowledge (e.g., mathematics). We construct LogicOCR by\ncurating a text corpus from the Chinese National Civil Servant Examination and\ndevelop a scalable, automated pipeline to convert it into multimodal samples.\nFirst, we design prompt templates to steer GPT-Image-1 to generate images with\ndiverse backgrounds, interleaved text-illustration layouts, and varied fonts,\nensuring contextual relevance and visual realism. Then, the generated images\nare manually verified, with low-quality examples discarded. We evaluate a range\nof representative open-source and proprietary LMMs under both Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) and direct-answer settings. Our multi-dimensional analysis reveals key\ninsights, such as the impact of test-time scaling, input modality differences,\nand sensitivity to visual-text orientation. Notably, LMMs still lag in\nmultimodal reasoning compared to text-only inputs, indicating that they have\nnot fully bridged visual reading with reasoning.

A common approach\nto improving OOD robustness is through data augmentations. However, in\nreal-world scenarios, models trained with generic augmentations can only\nimprove marginally when generalized under distribution shifts toward unlabeled\ntarget domains. While dataset-specific targeted augmentations can address this\nissue, they typically require expert knowledge and extensive prior data\nanalysis to identify the nature of the datasets and domain shift. To address\nthese challenges, we propose Frequency-Pixel Connect, a domain-adaptation\nframework that enhances OOD robustness by introducing a targeted augmentation\nin both the frequency space and pixel space. Specifically, we mix the amplitude\nspectrum and pixel content of a source image and a target image to generate\naugmented samples that introduce domain diversity while preserving the semantic\nstructure of the source image.

Nonetheless, the significant\nvariations among degradation types present challenges for training a universal\nmodel, often resulting in task interference, where the gradient update\ndirections of different tasks may diverge due to shared parameters. To address\nthis issue, motivated by the routing strategy, we propose DFPIR, a novel\nall-in-one image restorer that introduces Degradation-aware Feature\nPerturbations(DFP) to adjust the feature space to align with the unified\nparameter space. In this paper, the feature perturbations primarily include\nchannel-wise perturbations and attention-wise perturbations. Specifically,\nchannel-wise perturbations are implemented by shuffling the channels in\nhigh-dimensional space guided by degradation types, while attention-wise\nperturbations are achieved through selective masking in the attention space. To\nachieve these goals, we propose a Degradation-Guided Perturbation Block (DGPB)\nto implement these two functions, positioned between the encoding and decoding\nstages of the encoder-decoder architecture. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that DFPIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on several\nall-in-one image restoration tasks including image denoising, image dehazing,\nimage deraining, motion deblurring, and low-light image enhancement.

Recent\nadvances in vision-language models (VLMs), which can generate scene\ndescriptions for arbitrary images, combined with the availability of\nquantitative metrics for comparing linguistic descriptions, offer a new\nopportunity to model human scene understanding.

Based on this assumption, we propose a novel\nimage-computable model that integrates foveated vision with VLMs to produce a\nspatially resolved map of scene understanding as a function of fixation\nlocation (Foveated Scene Understanding Map, or F-SUM), along with an aggregate\nF-SUM score. This metric correlates with average (N=17) human RTs (r=0.47) and\nnumber of saccades (r=0.51) required to comprehend a scene (across 277 scenes).\nThe F-SUM score also correlates with average (N=16) human description accuracy\n(r=-0.56) in time-limited presentations.

Despite its popularity\nin image synthesis, invisible generative watermarking remains largely\nunderexplored in video generation. To address this gap, we propose Safe-Sora,\nthe first framework to embed graphical watermarks directly into the video\ngeneration process. Motivated by the observation that watermarking performance\nis closely tied to the visual similarity between the watermark and cover\ncontent, we introduce a hierarchical coarse-to-fine adaptive matching\nmechanism. Specifically, the watermark image is divided into patches, each\nassigned to the most visually similar video frame, and further localized to the\noptimal spatial region for seamless embedding. To enable spatiotemporal fusion\nof watermark patches across video frames, we develop a 3D wavelet\ntransform-enhanced Mamba architecture with a novel spatiotemporal local\nscanning strategy, effectively modeling long-range dependencies during\nwatermark embedding and retrieval.

To advance the task towards more practical scenarios, we\nintroduce \\textbf{Long-RVOS}, a large-scale benchmark for long-term referring\nvideo object segmentation. Long-RVOS contains 2,000+ videos of an average\nduration exceeding 60 seconds, covering a variety of objects that undergo\nocclusion, disappearance-reappearance and shot changing. The objects are\nmanually annotated with three different types of descriptions to individually\nevaluate the understanding of static attributes, motion patterns and\nspatiotemporal relationships.

We benchmark 6\nstate-of-the-art methods on Long-RVOS. The results show that current approaches\nstruggle severely with the long-video challenges. To address this, we further\npropose ReferMo, a promising baseline method that integrates motion information\nto expand the temporal receptive field, and employs a local-to-global\narchitecture to capture both short-term dynamics and long-term dependencies.\nDespite simplicity, ReferMo achieves significant improvements over current\nmethods in long-term scenarios.

Thus GradMix encourages the model to learn a more\ncomplete set of representative features from the same data source. Extensive\nexperiments on open set recognition, close set classification, and\nout-of-distribution detection reveal that our method can often outperform the\nstate-of-the-art.

As an\ninstance, the TarFlow model combines the transformer architecture with\nNormalizing Flow models, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple\nbenchmarks. However, due to the causal form of attention requiring sequential\ncomputation, TarFlow's sampling process is extremely slow. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate that through a series of optimization strategies, TarFlow sampling\ncan be greatly accelerated by using the Gauss-Seidel-Jacobi (abbreviated as\nGS-Jacobi) iteration method. Specifically, we find that blocks in the TarFlow\nmodel have varying importance: a small number of blocks play a major role in\nimage generation tasks, while other blocks contribute relatively little; some\nblocks are sensitive to initial values and prone to numerical overflow, while\nothers are relatively robust. Based on these two characteristics, we propose\nthe Convergence Ranking Metric (CRM) and the Initial Guessing Metric (IGM): CRM\nis used to identify whether a TarFlow block is \"simple\" (converges in few\niterations) or \"tough\" (requires more iterations); IGM is used to evaluate\nwhether the initial value of the iteration is good.

However, such frame-based methods inherently face\nchallenges in achieving low-latency performance and often fail in\nresource-constrained environments. Visual object tracking using bio-inspired\nevent cameras has emerged as a promising research direction in recent years,\noffering distinct advantages for low-latency applications. In this paper, we\npropose a novel Slow-Fast Tracking paradigm that flexibly adapts to different\noperational requirements, termed SFTrack. The proposed framework supports two\ncomplementary modes, i.e., a high-precision slow tracker for scenarios with\nsufficient computational resources, and an efficient fast tracker tailored for\nlatency-aware, resource-constrained environments. Specifically, our framework\nfirst performs graph-based representation learning from\nhigh-temporal-resolution event streams, and then integrates the learned\ngraph-structured information into two FlashAttention-based vision backbones,\nyielding the slow and fast trackers, respectively. The fast tracker achieves\nlow latency through a lightweight network design and by producing multiple\nbounding box outputs in a single forward pass.

While significant progress has been made, there\nare still key challenges that need to be addressed. First, many approaches\ndepend on a predefined degradation operator, making them ill-suited for complex\nor unknown degradations that deviate from standard analytical models. Second,\nmany methods struggle to provide a stable guidance in the latent space and\nfinally most methods convert latent representations back to the pixel domain\nfor guidance at every sampling iteration, which significantly increases\ncomputational and memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we introduce\na wavelet-inspired invertible neural network (INN) that simulates degradations\nthrough a forward transform and reconstructs lost details via the inverse\ntransform.

However, they usually apply single\nreceptive field (RF), small asymmetric RFs, or pyramid RFs to learn different\nfeature representations, still encountering two significant challenges in\nmedical image classification tasks: 1) They have limitations in capturing\ndiverse lesion characteristics efficiently, e.g., tiny, coordination, small and\nsalient, which have unique roles on results, especially imbalanced medical\nimage classification. 2) The predictions generated by those CNNs are often\nunfair/biased, bringing a high risk by employing them to real-world medical\ndiagnosis conditions. To tackle these issues, we develop a new concept,\nExpert-Like Reparameterization of Heterogeneous Pyramid Receptive Fields\n(ERoHPRF), to simultaneously boost medical image classification performance and\nfairness. This concept aims to mimic the multi-expert consultation mode by\napplying the well-designed heterogeneous pyramid RF bags to capture different\nlesion characteristics effectively via convolution operations with multiple\nheterogeneous kernel sizes. Additionally, ERoHPRF introduces an expert-like\nstructural reparameterization technique to merge its parameters with the\ntwo-stage strategy, ensuring competitive computation cost and inference speed\nthrough comparisons to a single RF.

Even recent vision foundation\nmodels, including the segment anything model (SAM), show notable performance\ndegradation in industrial settings. These challenges raise critical questions:\nCan we build a vision foundation model for industrial applications without\nrelying on real images or manual annotations?

To address these questions, we\npropose the Instance Core Segmentation Dataset (InsCore), a synthetic\npre-training dataset based on formula-driven supervised learning (FDSL).\nInsCore generates fully annotated instance segmentation images that reflect key\ncharacteristics of industrial data, including complex occlusions, dense\nhierarchical masks, and diverse non-rigid shapes, distinct from typical web\nimagery. Unlike previous methods, InsCore requires neither real images nor\nhuman annotations. Experiments on five industrial datasets show that models\npre-trained with InsCore outperform those trained on COCO and ImageNet-21k, as\nwell as fine-tuned SAM, achieving an average improvement of 6.2 points in\ninstance segmentation performance. This result is achieved using only 100k\nsynthetic images, more than 100 times fewer than the 11 million images in SAM's\nSA-1B dataset, demonstrating the data efficiency of our approach.

Recent\nadvances primarily build Birds-Eye-View (BEV) feature from front-view (FV)\nimages to perceive 3D information of Lane more effectively.

But separate training of these two models\nmakes them vulnerable to unknown attacks and burdens deployment environments.\nThe lack of a Unified Face Attack Detection model to handle both types of\nattacks is mainly due to two factors. First, there's a lack of adequate\nbenchmarks for models to explore. Existing UAD datasets have limited attack\ntypes and samples, restricting the model's ability to address advanced threats.\nTo address this, we propose UniAttackDataPlus (UniAttackData+), the most\nextensive and sophisticated collection of forgery techniques to date. It\nincludes 2,875 identities and their 54 kinds of falsified samples, totaling\n697,347 videos. Second, there's a lack of a reliable classification criterion.\nCurrent methods try to find an arbitrary criterion within the same semantic\nspace, which fails when encountering diverse attacks. So, we present a novel\nVisual-Language Model-based Hierarchical Prompt Tuning Framework (HiPTune) that\nadaptively explores multiple classification criteria from different semantic\nspaces. We build a Visual Prompt Tree to explore various classification rules\nhierarchically.

The quality of the VT\nlargely defines the upper bound of AR model performance. However, current\ndiscrete VTs fall significantly behind continuous variational autoencoders\n(VAEs), leading to degraded image reconstructions and poor preservation of\ndetails and text. Existing benchmarks focus on end-to-end generation quality,\nwithout isolating VT performance. To address this gap, we introduce VTBench, a\ncomprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates VTs across three core\ntasks: Image Reconstruction, Detail Preservation, and Text Preservation, and\ncovers a diverse range of evaluation scenarios. We systematically assess\nstate-of-the-art VTs using a set of metrics to evaluate the quality of\nreconstructed images. Our findings reveal that continuous VAEs produce superior\nvisual representations compared to discrete VTs, particularly in retaining\nspatial structure and semantic detail.

To alleviate this requirement and unlock the potential for\nself-supervised training on large-scale uncalibrated videos, we propose a novel\ntwo-stage strategy to train a view synthesis model from only raw video frames\nor multi-view images, without providing camera parameters or other priors. In\nthe first stage, we learn to reconstruct the scene implicitly in a latent space\nwithout relying on any explicit 3D representation. Specifically, we predict\nper-frame latent camera and scene context features, and employ a view synthesis\nmodel as a proxy for explicit rendering. This pretraining stage substantially\nreduces the optimization complexity and encourages the network to learn the\nunderlying 3D consistency in a self-supervised manner. The learned latent\ncamera and implicit scene representation have a large gap compared with the\nreal 3D world. To reduce this gap, we introduce the second stage training by\nexplicitly predicting 3D Gaussian primitives. We additionally apply explicit\nGaussian Splatting rendering loss and depth projection loss to align the\nlearned latent representations with physically grounded 3D geometry. In this\nway, Stage 1 provides a strong initialization and Stage 2 enforces 3D\nconsistency - the two stages are complementary and mutually beneficial.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving\nhigh-quality novel view synthesis and accurate camera pose estimation, compared\nto methods that employ supervision with calibration, pose, or depth\ninformation.

We propose three methods to extract these\nemerging entities, complementing each other based on label availability and\ndimensionality. Discrete sequence chunking (DSC) creates a dictionary of\nentities; population averaging (PA) extracts recurring entities that correspond\nto known labels; and unsupervised chunk discovery (UCD) can be used when labels\nare absent.

Environmental prompt injection attacks manipulate the environment to\ninduce the web agent to perform a specific, attacker-chosen action--referred to\nas the target action. However, existing attacks suffer from limited\neffectiveness or stealthiness, or are impractical in real-world settings. In\nthis work, we propose EnvInjection, a new attack that addresses these\nlimitations. Our attack adds a perturbation to the raw pixel values of the\nrendered webpage, which can be implemented by modifying the webpage's source\ncode. After these perturbed pixels are mapped into a screenshot, the\nperturbation induces the web agent to perform the target action. We formulate\nthe task of finding the perturbation as an optimization problem.

During this time,\npatients may experience organ motion due to breathing and other physiological\nfactors. Predicting and modeling this motion before treatment is crucial for\nensuring precise radiation delivery. However, existing pre-treatment organ\nmotion prediction methods primarily rely on deformation analysis using\nprincipal component analysis (PCA), which is highly dependent on registration\nquality and struggles to capture periodic temporal dynamics for motion\nmodeling.In this paper, we observe that organ motion prediction closely\nresembles an autoregressive process, a technique widely used in natural\nlanguage processing (NLP). Autoregressive models predict the next token based\non previous inputs, naturally aligning with our objective of predicting future\norgan motion phases. Building on this insight, we reformulate organ motion\nprediction as an autoregressive process to better capture patient-specific\nmotion patterns. Specifically, we acquire 4D CT scans for each patient before\ntreatment, with each sequence comprising multiple 3D CT phases. These phases\nare fed into the autoregressive model to predict future phases based on prior\nphase motion patterns. We evaluate our method on a real-world test set of 4D CT\nscans from 50 patients who underwent radiotherapy at our institution and a\npublic dataset containing 4D CT scans from 20 patients (some with multiple\nscans), totaling over 1,300 3D CT phases.

To address these, we propose MINGLE, a novel framework for\ntest-time continual model merging, which leverages test-time adaptation using a\nsmall set of unlabeled test samples from the current task to dynamically guide\nthe merging process. MINGLE employs a mixture-of-experts architecture composed\nof parameter-efficient, low-rank experts, enabling efficient adaptation and\nimproving robustness to distribution shifts. To mitigate catastrophic\nforgetting, we propose Null-Space Constrained Gating, which restricts gating\nupdates to subspaces orthogonal to prior task representations. This suppresses\nactivations on old task inputs and preserves model behavior on past tasks. To\nfurther balance stability and adaptability, we design an Adaptive Relaxation\nStrategy, which dynamically adjusts the constraint strength based on\ninterference signals captured during test-time adaptation. Extensive\nexperiments on standard continual merging benchmarks demonstrate that MINGLE\nachieves robust generalization, reduces forgetting significantly, and\nconsistently surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods by 7-9\\% on average\nacross diverse task orders.", "AI": {"tldr": "MINGLE\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6301\u7eed\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5408\u5e76\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89e3\u51b3\u53c2\u6570\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u9057\u5fd8\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6301\u7eed\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u5e03\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5dee\u3002", "method": "MINGLE\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4f4e\u79e9\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u95e8\u63a7\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u677e\u5f1b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5408\u5e76\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMINGLE\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5408\u5e76\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53477-9%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u9057\u5fd8\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MINGLE\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

One critical task for ophthalmologists\nusing OCT is delineation of retinal layers within scans. This process is\ntime-consuming and prone to human bias, affecting the accuracy and reliability\nof diagnoses. Previous efforts to automate delineation using deep learning face\nchallenges in uptake from clinicians and statisticians due to the absence of\nuncertainty estimation, leading to \"confidently wrong\" models via\nhallucinations. In this study, we address these challenges by applying Bayesian\nconvolutional neural networks (BCNNs) to segment an openly available OCT\nimaging dataset containing 35 human retina OCTs split between healthy controls\nand patients with multiple sclerosis. Our findings demonstrate that Bayesian\nmodels can be used to provide uncertainty maps of the segmentation, which can\nfurther be used to identify highly uncertain samples that exhibit recording\nartefacts such as noise or miscalibration at inference time. Our method also\nallows for uncertainty-estimation for important secondary measurements such as\nlayer thicknesses, that are medically relevant for patients. We show that these\nfeatures come in addition to greater performance compared to similar work over\nall delineations; with an overall Dice score of 95.65%.

However, integrating AI into these assessments raises ethical\nconcerns, especially around bias amplification rooted in training data. These\nbiases can lead to discriminatory outcomes based on protected attributes like\ngender, ethnicity, and age. To address this, we introduce a\ncounterfactual-based framework to systematically evaluate and quantify bias in\nAI-driven personality assessments. Our approach employs generative adversarial\nnetworks (GANs) to generate counterfactual representations of job applicants by\naltering protected attributes, enabling fairness analysis without access to the\nunderlying model. Unlike traditional bias assessments that focus on unimodal or\nstatic data, our method supports multimodal evaluation-spanning visual, audio,\nand textual features. This comprehensive approach is particularly important in\nhigh-stakes applications like hiring, where third-party vendors often provide\nAI systems as black boxes. Applied to a state-of-the-art personality prediction\nmodel, our method reveals significant disparities across demographic groups. We\nalso validate our framework using a protected attribute classifier to confirm\nthe effectiveness of our counterfactual generation.

To address\nthe challenges of multi-scale feature fusion and diverse noise distribution\npatterns in LDCT denoising, this paper introduces an innovative model,\nCTLformer, which combines convolutional structures with transformer\narchitecture. Two key innovations are proposed: a multi-scale attention\nmechanism and a dynamic attention control mechanism. The multi-scale attention\nmechanism, implemented through the Token2Token mechanism and self-attention\ninteraction modules, effectively captures both fine details and global\nstructures at different scales, enhancing relevant features and suppressing\nnoise. The dynamic attention control mechanism adapts the attention\ndistribution based on the noise characteristics of the input image, focusing on\nhigh-noise regions while preserving details in low-noise areas, thereby\nenhancing robustness and improving denoising performance. Furthermore,\nCTLformer integrates convolutional layers for efficient feature extraction and\nuses overlapping inference to mitigate boundary artifacts, further\nstrengthening its denoising capability. Experimental results on the 2016\nNational Institutes of Health AAPM Mayo Clinic LDCT Challenge dataset\ndemonstrate that CTLformer significantly outperforms existing methods in both\ndenoising performance and model efficiency, greatly improving the quality of\nLDCT images.

PDC operates solely on egocentric vision for task\nspecification, enabling object search, target placement, and skill selection\nthrough visual cues, without relying on privileged state information (e.g., 3D\nobject positions and geometries).

To achieve these goals, we conduct a focused analysis to\nidentify specific vulnerabilities within DMs, allowing VoiceCloak to disrupt\nthe cloning process by introducing adversarial perturbations into the reference\naudio.

The method allows DCLA to robustly mitigate\nhallucinations across multiple LVLMs. Experiments on hallucination benchmarks\nsuch as MME and POPE demonstrate that DCLA effectively reduces hallucinations\nwhile enhancing the reliability and performance of LVLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u673a\u5236DCLA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u805a\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u5c42\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "DCLA\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u5408\u524d\u5c42\u8868\u793a\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5e76\u6821\u6b63\u8bed\u4e49\u504f\u79bb\u7684\u5c42\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728MME\u548cPOPE\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDCLA\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DCLA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cdLVLM\u3002"}}

We\nintroduce Preference Isolation Forest (PIF), which embeds data into a\nhigh-dimensional preference space via manifold fitting, and isolates outliers\nusing two variants: Voronoi-iForest, based on geometric distances, and\nRuzHash-iForest, leveraging Locality Sensitive Hashing for scalability. We also\npropose Sliding-PIF, which captures local manifold information for streaming\nscenarios. Our methods outperform existing techniques on synthetic and real\ndatasets. We extend this to structure-based clustering with MultiLink, a novel\nmethod for recovering multiple geometric model families in noisy data.\nMultiLink merges clusters via a model-aware linkage strategy, enabling robust\nmulti-class structure recovery. It offers key advantages over existing\napproaches, such as speed, reduced sensitivity to thresholds, and improved\nrobustness to poor initial sampling. The second part of the thesis addresses\nonline anomaly detection in evolving data streams.

It avoids\nretraining while achieving accuracy comparable to offline models, with superior\nefficiency for real-time applications.

Secondly, our unified\ntokenization framework discretizes score images, audio, MIDI, and MusicXML into\na sequence of tokens, enabling a single encoder-decoder Transformer to tackle\nmultiple cross-modal translation as one coherent sequence-to-sequence task.\nExperimental results confirm that our unified multitask model improves upon\nsingle-task baselines in several key areas, notably reducing the symbol error\nrate for optical music recognition from 24.58% to a state-of-the-art 13.67%,\nwhile similarly substantial improvements are observed across the other\ntranslation tasks.

Conventional methods\noften optimize only the diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) without considering\ntheir relationship with the non-diffusion-weighted (b=0) reference images.\nHowever, calculating diffusion metrics, such as the apparent diffusion\ncoefficient (ADC) and diffusion tensor with its derived metrics like fractional\nanisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), relies on the ratio between each DWI\nand the b=0 image, which is crucial for clinical observation and diagnostics.\nIn this study, we demonstrate that solely enhancing DWIs using a conventional\npixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) loss is insufficient, as the error in ratio\nbetween generated DWIs and b=0 diverges. We propose a novel ratio loss, defined\nas the MSE loss between the predicted and ground-truth log of DWI/b=0 ratios.\nOur results show that incorporating the ratio loss significantly improves the\nconvergence of this ratio error, achieving lower ratio MSE and slightly\nenhancing the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of generated DWIs. This leads\nto improved dMRI super-resolution and better preservation of b=0 ratio-based\nfeatures for the derivation of diffusion metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6bd4\u7387\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u5584\u6269\u6563MRI\uff08dMRI\uff09\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6210\u50cf\u4e2dDWI\u4e0eb=0\u56fe\u50cf\u6bd4\u7387\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6269\u6563\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387dMRI\u6210\u50cf\u9762\u4e34\u91c7\u96c6\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f18\u5316DWI\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u5176\u4e0eb=0\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6269\u6563\u5ea6\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6bd4\u7387\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9eDWI/b=0\u6bd4\u7387\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684MSE\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u6bd4\u7387\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u6bd4\u7387\u635f\u5931\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6bd4\u7387\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u7565\u5fae\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210DWI\u7684PSNR\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6210\u50cf\u548c\u6269\u6563\u5ea6\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u4fdd\u7559\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6bd4\u7387\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86dMRI\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

We introduce a regularization that\naligns the output distribution for spuriosity-injected labels with the original\nzero-shot model, ensuring that the model is not induced to extract irrelevant\nfeatures further from these descriptions.We leverage recent language models to\nget such spuriosity-injected labels by generating alternative textual\ndescriptions that highlight potentially confounding features.Extensive\nexperiments validate the robust generalization of StarFT and its emerging\nproperties: zero-shot group robustness and improved zero-shot classification.\nNotably, StarFT boosts both worst-group and average accuracy by 14.30% and\n3.02%, respectively, in the Waterbirds group shift scenario, where other robust\nfine-tuning baselines show even degraded performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "StarFT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u865a\u5047\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982CLIP\uff09\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u5b66\u4e60\u865a\u5047\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u80cc\u666f\u6216\u7eb9\u7406\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStarFT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u865a\u5047\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u865a\u5047\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "StarFT\u5728Waterbirds\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6700\u5dee\u7ec4\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0814.30%\u548c3.02%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "StarFT\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

MM-PRM\ndemonstrates that process supervision is a powerful tool for enhancing the\nlogical robustness of multimodal reasoning systems.

In this\npaper, we aim to push the limits of memory-efficient training by minimizing\nmemory usage on model weights, gradients, and optimizer states, within a\nunified framework. Our idea is to eliminate both gradients and optimizer states\nusing zeroth-order optimization, which approximates gradients by perturbing\nweights during forward passes to identify gradient directions. To minimize\nmemory usage on weights, we employ model quantization, e.g., converting from\nbfloat16 to int4. However, directly applying zeroth-order optimization to\nquantized weights is infeasible due to the precision gap between discrete\nweights and continuous gradients, which would otherwise require de-quantization\nand re-quantization. To overcome this challenge, we propose Quantized\nZeroth-order Optimization (QZO), a novel approach that perturbs the continuous\nquantization scale for gradient estimation and uses a directional derivative\nclipping method to stabilize training. QZO is orthogonal to both scalar-based\nand codebook-based post-training quantization methods. Compared to\nfull-parameter fine-tuning in bfloat16, QZO can reduce the total memory cost by\nmore than 18$\\times$ for 4-bit LLMs, and enables fine-tuning Llama-2-13B and\nStable Diffusion 3.5 Large within a single 24GB GPU.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aQZO\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11GPU\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff0cGPU\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u4e3a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u914d\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u6d88\u9664\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\uff08\u5982bfloat16\u8f6cint4\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51faQZO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u91cf\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "QZO\u57284\u4f4dLLM\u4e0a\u6bd4bfloat16\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u51cf\u5c1118\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u53ef\u572824GB GPU\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03Llama-2-13B\u548cStable Diffusion 3.5 Large\u3002", "conclusion": "QZO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}
