To this end, we propose the Grouped NonLinear\ntransformation generation method (GroupNL), which generates diversified feature\nmaps by utilizing data-agnostic Nonlinear Transformation Functions (NLFs) to\nimprove the robustness of the CNN model. Specifically, partial convolution\nfilters are designated as seed filters in a convolutional layer, and a small\nset of feature maps, i.e., seed feature maps, are first generated based on\nvanilla convolution operation. Then, we split seed feature maps into several\ngroups, each with a set of different NLFs, to generate corresponding diverse\nfeature maps with in-place nonlinear processing. Moreover, GroupNL effectively\nreduces the parameter transmission between multiple nodes during model training\nby setting the hyperparameters of NLFs to random initialization and not\nupdating them during model training, and reduces the computing resources by\nusing NLFs to generate feature maps instead of most feature maps generated\nbased on sliding windows.

We first perform an MIA method under the white-box setting, where we\ncan obtain the embeddings of the image through the vision part of the target\nLVLM. The attacks are based on the embedding similarity between the image and\nits corrupted version. We further explore a more practical scenario where we\nhave no knowledge about target LVLMs and we can only query the target LVLMs\nwith an image and a question.

While most existing TTA methods for video primarily utilize visual\nsupervisory signals, they often overlook the potential contribution of inherent\naudio data. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that incorporates\naudio information into video TTA. Our method capitalizes on the rich semantic\ncontent of audio to generate audio-assisted pseudo-labels, a new concept in the\ncontext of video TTA. Specifically, we propose an audio-to-video label mapping\nmethod by first employing pre-trained audio models to classify audio signals\nextracted from videos and then mapping the audio-based predictions to video\nlabel spaces through large language models, thereby establishing a connection\nbetween the audio categories and video labels. To effectively leverage the\ngenerated pseudo-labels, we present a flexible adaptation cycle that determines\nthe optimal number of adaptation iterations for each sample, based on changes\nin loss and consistency across different views. This enables a customized\nadaptation process for each sample.

Typically, existing CBM\nmethods associate the final layer of visual encoders with concepts to explain\nthe model's predictions. However, we empirically discover the phenomenon of\nconcept preference variation, that is, the concepts are preferably associated\nwith the features at different layers than those only at the final layer; yet a\nblind last-layer-based association neglects such a preference variation and\nthus weakens the accurate correspondences between features and concepts,\nimpairing model interpretability. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nMulti-layer Visual Preference-enhanced Concept Bottleneck Model (MVP-CBM),\nwhich comprises two key novel modules: (1) intra-layer concept preference\nmodeling, which captures the preferred association of different concepts with\nfeatures at various visual layers, and (2) multi-layer concept sparse\nactivation fusion, which sparsely aggregates concept activations from multiple\nlayers to enhance performance. Thus, by explicitly modeling concept\npreferences, MVP-CBM can comprehensively leverage multi-layer visual\ninformation to provide a more nuanced and accurate explanation of model\ndecisions.

However,\nthese large models typically process videos by averaging embedding outputs from\nmultiple clips over time to produce fixed-length representations. This approach\nfails to account for a variety of time-related features, such as variable video\ndurations, chronological order of events, and temporal variance in feature\nsignificance. While methods for temporal modeling do exist, they often require\nsignificant architectural changes and expensive retraining, making them\nimpractical for off-the-shelf, fine-tuned large encoders. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose DejaVid, an encoder-agnostic method that enhances model\nperformance without the need for retraining or altering the architecture. Our\nframework converts a video into a variable-length temporal sequence of\nembeddings, which we call a multivariate time series (MTS). An MTS naturally\npreserves temporal order and accommodates variable video durations. We then\nlearn per-timestep, per-feature weights over the encoded MTS frames, allowing\nus to account for variations in feature importance over time. We introduce a\nnew neural network architecture inspired by traditional time series alignment\nalgorithms for this learning task.

Existing multi-scale fusion methods help, but add\ncomputational burden and blur fine details, making small object detection in\ncluttered scenes difficult. To overcome these challenges, we propose the\nMulti-scale Global-detail Feature Integration Strategy (MGDFIS), a unified\nfusion framework that tightly couples global context with local detail to boost\ndetection performance while maintaining efficiency. MGDFIS comprises three\nsynergistic modules: the FusionLock-TSS Attention Module, which marries\ntoken-statistics self-attention with DynamicTanh normalization to highlight\nspectral and spatial cues at minimal cost; the Global-detail Integration\nModule, which fuses multi-scale context via directional convolution and\nparallel attention while preserving subtle shape and texture variations; and\nthe Dynamic Pixel Attention Module, which generates pixel-wise weighting maps\nto rebalance uneven foreground and background distributions and sharpen\nresponses to true object regions.

While existing models perform well\non novel view synthesis for isolated objects, they struggle to generalize to\ncomplex, cluttered scenes. To address this, GenMOJO decomposes the scene into\nindividual objects, optimizing a differentiable set of deformable Gaussians per\nobject. This object-wise decomposition allows leveraging object-centric\ndiffusion models to infer unobserved regions in novel viewpoints. It performs\njoint Gaussian splatting to render the full scene, capturing cross-object\nocclusions, and enabling occlusion-aware supervision. To bridge the gap between\nobject-centric priors and the global frame-centric coordinate system of videos,\nGenMOJO uses differentiable transformations that align generative and rendering\nconstraints within a unified framework.

Some previous methods inspired by dropout, which enhances\ngeneralization by regularizing features, have shown promising results in blind\nSR. Nevertheless, these methods focus solely on regularizing features before\nthe final layer and overlook the need for generalization in features at\nintermediate layers. Without explicit regularization of features at\nintermediate layers, the blind SR network struggles to obtain well-generalized\nfeature representations. However, the key challenge is that directly applying\ndropout to intermediate layers leads to a significant performance drop, which\nwe attribute to the inconsistency in training-testing and across layers it\nintroduced. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Dropout, a new regularization method\nfor blind SR models, which mitigates the inconsistency and facilitates\napplication across intermediate layers of networks. Specifically, for\ntraining-testing inconsistency, we re-design the form of dropout and integrate\nthe features before and after dropout adaptively. For inconsistency in\ngeneralization requirements across different layers, we innovatively design an\nadaptive training strategy to strengthen feature propagation by layer-wise\nannealing. Experimental results show that our method outperforms all past\nregularization methods on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets,\nalso highly effective in other image restoration tasks.

Current learning-based methods attempt to\nleverage ``more\" information from both the spatial and the short-term temporal\ndomains, but suffer from unreliable performance under complex conditions while\nincurring computational redundancy. In this paper, we explore the ``more\nessential\" information from a more crucial domain for the detection. Through\ntheoretical analysis, we reveal that the global temporal saliency and\ncorrelation information in the temporal profile demonstrate significant\nsuperiority in distinguishing target signals from other signals. To investigate\nwhether such superiority is preferentially leveraged by well-trained networks,\nwe built the first prediction attribution tool in this field and verified the\nimportance of the temporal profile information. Inspired by the above\nconclusions, we remodel the IRST detection task as a one-dimensional signal\nanomaly detection task, and propose an efficient deep temporal probe network\n(DeepPro) that only performs calculations in the time dimension for IRST\ndetection. We conducted extensive experiments to fully validate the\neffectiveness of our method.

Traditional approaches, which rely on empirical formulas or\nphysical simulations, often suffer from limited accuracy or require strong\nscene priors. Recent neural radiance field (NeRF-based) methods improve\nreconstruction fidelity through differentiable volumetric rendering, but their\nreliance on computationally expensive multilayer perceptron (MLP) queries\nhinders real-time deployment. To overcome these challenges, we introduce\nGaussian splatting (GS) to the wireless domain, leveraging its efficiency in\nmodeling optical radiance fields to enable compact and accurate WRF\nreconstruction. Specifically, we propose SwiftWRF, a deformable 2D Gaussian\nsplatting framework that synthesizes WRF spectra at arbitrary positions under\nsingle-sided transceiver mobility. SwiftWRF employs CUDA-accelerated\nrasterization to render spectra at over 100000 fps and uses a lightweight MLP\nto model the deformation of 2D Gaussians, effectively capturing\nmobility-induced WRF variations.

Consequently, performance on extensive masked areas\nremains suboptimal.

DiT\nsynergistically combines the advantages of diffusion models and transformer\narchitectures to maintain long-term temporal consistency while ensuring\nhigh-quality inpainting results. We propose a Circular Position-Shift strategy\nto further enhance long-term temporal consistency during the inference stage.\nAdditionally, the proposed method automatically detects objects within videos,\ninteractively removes specified objects, and generates corresponding prompts.\nIn terms of processing speed, it takes only 180 seconds (testing on one NVIDIA\nA100 GPU) to complete a video with a resolution of $1080 \\times 1920$ with 121\nframes without any acceleration method. Experimental results indicate that the\nproposed method demonstrates superior performance in content fidelity, texture\nrestoration, and temporal consistency.

Furthermore, our\nproposed models provide competitive results or outperform alternative models,\noften using significantly fewer parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u591a\u4eba2D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u67e5\u8be2\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u5c11\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u591a\u4eba\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6b63\u8d1f\u67e5\u8be2\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\uff085-10\u500d\u5c11\u8f6e\u6b21\uff09\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cf\u5316\u5e93\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u591a\u4eba\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Traditional motion-capture systems rely on physical markers.\nAlthough they offer high accuracy, their requirements of specialized hardware,\nmanual marker placement, and extensive post-processing make them costly and\ntime-consuming. Recent learning-based methods attempt to overcome these\nlimitations, but most are designed for single-person capture, rely on sparse\nkeypoints, or struggle with occlusions and physical interactions. In this work,\nwe introduce a method that predicts dense 2D surface landmarks conditioned on\nsegmentation masks, enabling person-specific correspondence estimation even\nunder heavy occlusion. We employ a novel architecture that exploits learnable\nqueries for each landmark. We demonstrate that our approach can handle complex\nperson--person interaction and offers greater accuracy than existing methods.\nTo train our network, we construct a large, synthetic multi-view dataset\ncombining human motions from diverse sources, including extreme poses, hand\nmotions, and close interactions. Our dataset yields high-variability synthetic\nsequences with rich body contact and occlusion, and includes SMPL-X\nground-truth annotations with dense 2D landmarks. The result is a system\ncapable of capturing human motion without the need for markers. Our approach\noffers competitive reconstruction quality compared to commercial marker-based\nmotion-capture solutions, without the extensive manual cleanup. Finally, we\naddress the absence of common benchmarks for dense-landmark prediction and\nmarkerless motion capture by introducing two evaluation settings built from\nreal multi-view sequences.

However, perceptual\nerrors -- especially overlooked but visible abnormalities -- remain common and\nclinically significant. Current workflows and AI systems provide limited\nsupport for detecting such errors after interpretation and often lack\nmeaningful human--AI collaboration. We introduce RADAR (Radiologist--AI\nDiagnostic Assistance and Review), a post-interpretation companion system.\nRADAR ingests finalized radiologist annotations and CXR images, then performs\nregional-level analysis to detect and refer potentially missed abnormal\nregions. The system supports a \"second-look\" workflow and offers suggested\nregions of interest (ROIs) rather than fixed labels to accommodate\ninter-observer variation. We evaluated RADAR on a simulated perceptual-error\ndataset derived from de-identified CXR cases, using F1 score and Intersection\nover Union (IoU) as primary metrics. RADAR achieved a recall of 0.78, precision\nof 0.44, and an F1 score of 0.56 in detecting missed abnormalities in the\nsimulated perceptual-error dataset. Although precision is moderate, this\nreduces over-reliance on AI by encouraging radiologist oversight in human--AI\ncollaboration. The median IoU was 0.78, with more than 90% of referrals\nexceeding 0.5 IoU, indicating accurate regional localization. RADAR effectively\ncomplements radiologist judgment, providing valuable post-read support for\nperceptual-error detection in CXR interpretation. Its flexible ROI suggestions\nand non-intrusive integration position it as a promising tool in real-world\nradiology workflows.

It extends conventional Video Crowd\nCounting (VCC) beyond the per-frame pedestrian count. In contrast to VCC that\nonly learns to count repeated pedestrian patterns across frames, the key\nproblem of VIC is how to identify co-existent pedestrians between frames, which\nturns out to be a correspondence problem. Existing VIC approaches, however,\nmainly follow a one-to-one (O2O) matching strategy where the same pedestrian\nmust be exactly matched between frames, leading to sensitivity to appearance\nvariations or missing detections. In this work, we show that the O2O matching\ncould be relaxed to a one-to-many (O2M) matching problem, which better fits the\nproblem nature of VIC and can leverage the social grouping behavior of walking\npedestrians.

However, directly applying\nMamba to PCR tasks yields suboptimal performance due to the unordered and\nirregular nature of point cloud data. To address this challenge, we propose\nMT-PCR, the first point cloud registration framework that integrates both Mamba\nand Transformer modules. Specifically, we serialize point cloud features using\nZ-order space-filling curves to enforce spatial locality, enabling Mamba to\nbetter model the geometric structure of the input. Additionally, we remove the\norder indicator module commonly used in Mamba-based sequence modeling, leads to\nimproved performance in our setting. The serialized features are then processed\nby an optimized Mamba encoder, followed by a Transformer refinement stage.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MT-PCR\noutperforms Transformer-based and concurrent state-of-the-art methods in both\naccuracy and efficiency, significantly reducing while GPU memory usage and\nFLOPs.", "AI": {"tldr": "MT-PCR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408Mamba\u548cTransformer\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u6ce8\u518c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Z-order\u7a7a\u95f4\u586b\u5145\u66f2\u7ebf\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u70b9\u4e91\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u6ce8\u518c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u70b9\u4e91\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u3002Mamba\u867d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u70b9\u4e91\u6ce8\u518c\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMT-PCR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Z-order\u7a7a\u95f4\u586b\u5145\u66f2\u7ebf\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u70b9\u4e91\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f18\u5316Mamba\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u79fb\u9664\u987a\u5e8f\u6307\u793a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMT-PCR\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eGPU\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "MT-PCR\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408Mamba\u548cTransformer\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u70b9\u4e91\u6ce8\u518c\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, existing methods\nstruggle with consistently achieving sub-millimeter accuracy, robustness under\nbroad initial pose estimates or need manual key-point annotations. This work\naims to address these challenges by proposing a novel multi-view X-ray/CT\nregistration method for intraoperative bone registration. Methods: The proposed\nregistration method consists of a multi-view, contour-based iterative closest\npoint (ICP) optimization. Unlike previous methods, which attempt to match bone\ncontours across the entire silhouette in both imaging modalities, we focus on\nmatching specific subcategories of contours corresponding to bone\nsubstructures. This leads to reduced ambiguity in the ICP matches, resulting in\na more robust and accurate registration solution. This approach requires only\ntwo X-ray images and operates fully automatically. Additionally, we contribute\na dataset of 5 cadaveric specimens, including real X-ray images, X-ray image\nposes and the corresponding CT scans. Results: The proposed registration method\nis evaluated on real X-ray images using mean reprojection error (mRPD). The\nmethod consistently achieves sub-millimeter accuracy with a mRPD 0.67mm\ncompared to 5.35mm by a commercial solution requiring manual intervention.\nFurthermore, the method offers improved practical applicability, being fully\nautomatic. Conclusion: Our method offers a practical, accurate, and efficient\nsolution for multi-view X-ray/CT registration in orthopedic surgeries, which\ncan be easily combined with tracking systems. By improving registration\naccuracy and minimizing manual intervention, it enhances intraoperative\nnavigation, contributing to more accurate and effective surgical outcomes in\ncomputer-assisted surgery (CAS).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u89c6\u89d2X\u5c04\u7ebf/CT\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9aa8\u79d1\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u9aa8\u914d\u51c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e9a\u6beb\u7c73\u7ea7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u5e7f\u6cdb\u521d\u59cb\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6216\u624b\u52a8\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u6700\u8fd1\u70b9\uff08ICP\uff09\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5339\u914d\u9aa8\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u8f6e\u5ed3\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6b67\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9eX\u5c04\u7ebf\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u91cd\u6295\u5f71\u8bef\u5dee\uff08mRPD\uff09\u4e3a0.67mm\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff085.35mm\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9aa8\u79d1\u624b\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2X\u5c04\u7ebf/CT\u914d\u51c6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u672f\u4e2d\u5bfc\u822a\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Existing 3D scene understanding methods use large-scale\ntraining data and CLIP to align text queries with 3D semantic features.\nHowever, their reliance on predefined vocabulary priors from training data\nhinders free-form semantic querying. Besides, recent advanced methods rely on\nLLMs for scene understanding but lack comprehensive 3D scene-level information\nand often overlook the potential inconsistencies in LLM-generated outputs. In\nour paper, we propose FreeQ-Graph, which enables Free-form Querying with a\nsemantic consistent scene Graph for 3D scene understanding. The core idea is to\nencode free-form queries from a complete and accurate 3D scene graph without\npredefined vocabularies, and to align them with 3D consistent semantic labels,\nwhich accomplished through three key steps. We initiate by constructing a\ncomplete and accurate 3D scene graph that maps free-form objects and their\nrelations through LLM and LVLM guidance, entirely free from training data or\npredefined priors. Most importantly, we align graph nodes with accurate\nsemantic labels by leveraging 3D semantic aligned features from merged\nsuperpoints, enhancing 3D semantic consistency. To enable free-form semantic\nquerying, we then design an LLM-based reasoning algorithm that combines\nscene-level and object-level information to intricate reasoning.

A total of 560 days of\nmultimodal sensor data, including acceleration, step count, ambient motion, GPS\nlocation, heart rate, and sleep, alongside clinical scores, were remotely\ncollected from patients at home. Clustering was first carried out separately\nfor each data modality to assess the impact of feature sets extracted from each\nmodality on patients' recovery trajectories.

The quality of these\nclusters and their corresponding labels was validated through rigorous\nstatistical testing and visualization against clinical scores collected\nalongside the multimodal sensor data. The results demonstrated the statistical\nsignificance of most modality-specific cluster labels generated by the large\nlanguage model with respect to clinical scores, confirming the efficacy of the\nproposed method for interpreting sensor data in an unsupervised manner.

However,\ncurrent multimodal reranking methods remain underexplored, with significant\nroom for improvement in both training strategies and overall effectiveness.\nMoreover, the lack of explicit reasoning makes it difficult to analyze and\noptimize these methods further. In this paper, We propose MM-R5, a MultiModal\nReasoning-Enhanced ReRanker via Reinforcement Learning for Document Retrieval,\naiming to provide a more effective and reliable solution for multimodal\nreranking tasks. MM-R5 is trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT)\nand reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we focus on improving\ninstruction-following and guiding the model to generate complete and\nhigh-quality reasoning chains. To support this, we introduce a novel data\nconstruction strategy that produces rich, high-quality reasoning data. In the\nRL stage, we design a task-specific reward framework, including a reranking\nreward tailored for multimodal candidates and a composite template-based reward\nto further refine reasoning quality. We conduct extensive experiments on\nMMDocIR, a challenging public benchmark spanning multiple domains.

Drawing on the center-surround\norganization of retinal ganglion cell receptive fields, we propose a\nfrequency-domain feature extraction algorithm that enhances the detection of\nfault signatures in vibration signals. SFRFs are designed as antagonistic\nspectral filters centered on characteristic fault frequencies, with inhibitory\nsurrounds that enable robust characterization of incipient faults under\nvariable operating conditions. A multi-objective evolutionary optimization\nstrategy based on NSGA-II algorithm is employed to tune the receptive field\nparameters by simultaneously minimizing RUL prediction error, maximizing\nfeature monotonicity, and promoting smooth degradation trajectories. The method\nis demonstrated on the XJTU-SY bearing run-to-failure dataset, confirming its\nsuitability for constructing condition indicators in health monitoring\napplications. Key contributions include: (i) the introduction of SFRFs,\ninspired by the biology of vision in the primate retina; (ii) an evolutionary\noptimization framework guided by condition monitoring and prognosis criteria;\nand (iii) experimental evidence supporting the detection of early-stage faults\nand their precursors.

Attackers can implant latent triggers\nthat persist through downstream tasks, enabling malicious control of model\nbehavior upon trigger presentation. Despite great success in recent defense\nmechanisms, they remain impractical due to strong assumptions about attacker\nknowledge or excessive clean data requirements. In this paper, we introduce\nInverTune, the first backdoor defense framework for multimodal models under\nminimal attacker assumptions, requiring neither prior knowledge of attack\ntargets nor access to the poisoned dataset. Unlike existing defense methods\nthat rely on the same dataset used in the poisoning stage, InverTune\neffectively identifies and removes backdoor artifacts through three key\ncomponents, achieving robust protection against backdoor attacks. Specifically,\nInverTune first exposes attack signatures through adversarial simulation,\nprobabilistically identifying the target label by analyzing model response\npatterns. Building on this, we develop a gradient inversion technique to\nreconstruct latent triggers through activation pattern analysis. Finally, a\nclustering-guided fine-tuning strategy is employed to erase the backdoor\nfunction with only a small amount of arbitrary clean data, while preserving the\noriginal model capabilities. Experimental results show that InverTune reduces\nthe average attack success rate (ASR) by 97.87% against the state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) attacks while limiting clean accuracy (CA) degradation to just 3.07%.\nThis work establishes a new paradigm for securing multimodal systems, advancing\nsecurity in foundation model deployment without compromising performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "InverTune\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u77e5\u8bc6\u6216\u4e2d\u6bd2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u53cd\u6f14\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u5fae\u8c03\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982CLIP\uff09\u6613\u53d7\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u5047\u8bbe\u8fc7\u5f3a\u6216\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u8fc7\u9ad8\u800c\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u3002", "method": "InverTune\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u6a21\u62df\u66b4\u9732\u653b\u51fb\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u53cd\u6f14\u91cd\u5efa\u6f5c\u5728\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff0c\u805a\u7c7b\u5fae\u8c03\u6d88\u9664\u540e\u95e8\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aInverTune\u5c06\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u964d\u4f4e97.87%\uff0c\u4ec5\u635f\u59313.07%\u7684\u6e05\u6d01\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "InverTune\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

The analysis critically assesses prevailing repertoires,\ncomputational approaches, and evaluation methodologies, highlighting\nsignificant challenges. It reveals that a substantial portion of existing\nresearch suffers from inadequate validation protocols and an over-reliance on\nsimple accuracy metrics for often imbalanced datasets, which can undermine the\ncredibility of attribution claims. The crucial role of robust metrics like\nBalanced Accuracy and rigorous cross-validation in ensuring trustworthy results\nis emphasized. The survey also details diverse feature representations and the\nevolution of machine learning models employed. Notable real-world authorship\nattribution cases, such as those involving works attributed to Bach, Josquin\nDesprez, and Lennon-McCartney, are specifically discussed, illustrating the\nopportunities and pitfalls of applying computational techniques to resolve\ndisputed musical provenance.

However, directly applying INR techniques to 3D\ndental cone-beam CT (CBCT) with a truncated field of view (FOV) is challenging.\nDuring the training process, if the FOV does not fully encompass the patient's\nhead, a discrepancy arises between the measured projections and the forward\nprojections computed within the truncated domain. This mismatch leads the\nnetwork to estimate attenuation values inaccurately, producing severe artifacts\nin the reconstructed images. In this study, we propose a computationally\nefficient INR-based reconstruction framework that leverages multi-resolution\nhash encoding for 3D dental CBCT with a truncated FOV. To mitigate truncation\nartifacts, we train the network over an expanded reconstruction domain that\nfully encompasses the patient's head. For computational efficiency, we adopt an\nadaptive training strategy that uses a multi-resolution grid: finer resolution\nlevels and denser sampling inside the truncated FOV, and coarser resolution\nlevels with sparser sampling outside. To maintain consistent input\ndimensionality of the network across spatially varying resolutions, we\nintroduce an adaptive hash encoder that selectively activates the lower-level\nfeatures of the hash hierarchy for points outside the truncated FOV. The\nproposed method with an extended FOV effectively mitigates truncation\nartifacts.

However, directly modeling the shape of a neural implicit surface,\nespecially as the zero-level set of a neural signed distance function (SDF),\nwith sparse geometric control is still a challenging task. Sparse input shape\ncontrol typically includes 3D curve networks or, more generally, 3D curve\nsketches, which are unstructured and cannot be connected to form a curve\nnetwork, and therefore more difficult to deal with. While 3D curve networks or\ncurve sketches provide intuitive shape control, their sparsity and varied\ntopology pose challenges in generating high-quality surfaces to meet such curve\nconstraints. In this paper, we propose NeuVAS, a variational approach to shape\nmodeling using neural implicit surfaces constrained under sparse input shape\ncontrol, including unstructured 3D curve sketches as well as connected 3D curve\nnetworks.

In this work, we\nintroduce \\textbf{Metis-RISE} (\\textbf{R}L \\textbf{I}ncentivizes and\n\\textbf{S}FT \\textbf{E}nhances) for multimodal reasoning model learning. Unlike\nconventional approaches, Metis-RISE distinctively omits an initial SFT stage,\nbeginning instead with an RL phase (e.g., using a Group Relative Policy\nOptimization variant) to incentivize and activate the model's latent reasoning\ncapacity. Subsequently, the targeted SFT stage addresses two key challenges\nidentified during RL: (1) \\textit{inefficient trajectory sampling} for tasks\nwhere the model possesses but inconsistently applies correct reasoning, which\nwe tackle using self-distilled reasoning trajectories from the RL model itself;\nand (2) \\textit{fundamental capability absence}, which we address by injecting\nexpert-augmented knowledge for prompts where the model entirely fails. This\nstrategic application of RL for incentivization followed by SFT for enhancement\nforms the core of Metis-RISE, leading to two versions of our MLLMs (7B and 72B\nparameters).

In this paper, we propose\ncontext-oriented decomposition adaptation (CorDA), a novel method that\ninitializes adapters in a task-aware manner. Concretely, we develop\ncontext-oriented singular value decomposition, where we collect covariance\nmatrices of input activations for each linear layer using sampled data from the\ntarget task, and apply SVD to the product of weight matrix and its\ncorresponding covariance matrix. By doing so, the task-specific capability is\ncompacted into the principal components. Thanks to the task awareness, our\nmethod enables two optional adaptation modes, knowledge-preserved mode (KPM)\nand instruction-previewed mode (IPM), providing flexibility to choose between\nfreezing the principal components to preserve their associated knowledge or\nadapting them to better learn a new task. We further develop CorDA++ by\nderiving a metric that reflects the compactness of task-specific principal\ncomponents, and then introducing dynamic covariance selection and dynamic rank\nallocation strategies based on the same metric. The two strategies provide each\nlayer with the most representative covariance matrix and a proper rank\nallocation. Experimental results show that CorDA++ outperforms CorDA by a\nsignificant margin. CorDA++ in KPM not only achieves better fine-tuning\nperformance than LoRA, but also mitigates the forgetting of pre-trained\nknowledge in both large language models and vision language models.

In this\nwork, we present SeqPE, a unified and fully learnable position encoding\nframework that represents each $n$-dimensional position index as a symbolic\nsequence and employs a lightweight sequential position encoder to learn their\nembeddings in an end-to-end manner. To regularize SeqPE's embedding space, we\nintroduce two complementary objectives: a contrastive objective that aligns\nembedding distances with a predefined position-distance function, and a\nknowledge distillation loss that anchors out-of-distribution position\nembeddings to in-distribution teacher representations, further enhancing\nextrapolation performance. Experiments across language modeling, long-context\nquestion answering, and 2D image classification demonstrate that SeqPE not only\nsurpasses strong baselines in perplexity, exact match (EM), and\naccuracy--particularly under context length extrapolation--but also enables\nseamless generalization to multi-dimensional inputs without requiring manual\narchitectural redesign.

Existing LMMs typically concatenate\nrepresentation of modalities along the sequence dimension and feed them into a\nlarge language model (LLM) backbone. While sequence-dimension concatenation is\nstraightforward for modality integration, it often relies heavily on\nlarge-scale data to learn modality alignments. In this paper, we aim to model\nthe relationships between modalities more purposefully, thereby achieving more\nefficient and flexible modality alignments. To this end, we propose\nStream-Omni, a large language-vision-speech model with efficient modality\nalignments, which can simultaneously support interactions under various\nmodality combinations. Stream-Omni employs LLM as the backbone and aligns the\nvision and speech to the text based on their relationships. For vision that is\nsemantically complementary to text, Stream-Omni uses sequence-dimension\nconcatenation to achieve vision-text alignment. For speech that is semantically\nconsistent with text, Stream-Omni introduces a CTC-based layer-dimension\nmapping to achieve speech-text alignment.

We introduce VisuoTactile Local\n(ViTaL) policy learning, a framework that solves fine-grained manipulation\ntasks by decomposing them into two phases: a reaching phase, where a\nvision-language model (VLM) enables scene-level reasoning to localize the\nobject of interest, and a local interaction phase, where a reusable,\nscene-agnostic ViTaL policy performs contact-rich manipulation using egocentric\nvision and tactile sensing. This approach is motivated by the observation that\nwhile scene context varies, the low-level interaction remains consistent across\ntask instances. By training local policies once in a canonical setting, they\ncan generalize via a localize-then-execute strategy. ViTaL achieves around 90%\nsuccess on contact-rich tasks in unseen environments and is robust to\ndistractors. ViTaL's effectiveness stems from three key insights: (1)\nfoundation models for segmentation enable training robust visual encoders via\nbehavior cloning; (2) these encoders improve the generalizability of policies\nlearned using residual RL; and (3) tactile sensing significantly boosts\nperformance in contact-rich tasks. Ablation studies validate each of these\ninsights, and we demonstrate that ViTaL integrates well with high-level VLMs,\nenabling robust, reusable low-level skills.

Preprint. Work in Progress", "summary": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling.\nDespite more stable training, the loss of diffusion models is not indicative of\nabsolute data-fitting quality, since its optimal value is typically not zero\nbut unknown, leading to confusion between large optimal loss and insufficient\nmodel capacity. In this work, we advocate the need to estimate the optimal loss\nvalue for diagnosing and improving diffusion models. We first derive the\noptimal loss in closed form under a unified formulation of diffusion models,\nand develop effective estimators for it, including a stochastic variant\nscalable to large datasets with proper control of variance and bias. With this\ntool, we unlock the inherent metric for diagnosing the training quality of\nmainstream diffusion model variants, and develop a more performant training\nschedule based on the optimal loss. Moreover, using models with 120M to 1.5B\nparameters, we find that the power law is better demonstrated after subtracting\nthe optimal loss from the actual training loss, suggesting a more principled\nsetting for investigating the scaling law for diffusion models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u4f18\u635f\u5931\u503c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u635f\u5931\u503c\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u53cd\u6620\u6570\u636e\u62df\u5408\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5bfc\u6700\u4f18\u635f\u5931\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u635f\u5931\u503c\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u4e3a\u96f6\u4e14\u672a\u77e5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u635f\u5931\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u5148\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u4f18\u635f\u5931\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u968f\u673a\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u635f\u5931\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u4e3b\u6d41\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u5212\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u51cf\u53bb\u6700\u4f18\u635f\u5931\u540e\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u66f4\u80fd\u4f53\u73b0\u5e42\u5f8b\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u635f\u5931\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}
