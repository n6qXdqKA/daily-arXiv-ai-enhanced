Despite their importance, PEs suffer from physics\nfailures, deviations from expected physical behaviors that can compromise\nsoftware reliability, degrade user experience, and potentially cause critical\nfailures in autonomous vehicles or medical robotics. Current testing approaches\nfor PE-based software are inadequate, typically requiring white-box access and\nfocusing on crash detection rather than semantically complex physics failures.\nThis paper presents the first large-scale empirical study characterizing\nphysics failures in PE-based software. We investigate three research questions\naddressing the manifestations of physics failures, the effectiveness of\ndetection techniques, and developer perceptions of current detection practices.\nOur contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of physics failure manifestations;\n(2) a comprehensive evaluation of detection methods including deep learning,\nprompt-based techniques, and large multimodal models; and (3) actionable\ninsights from developer experiences for improving detection approaches.

However, models' complex trade-offs among these dimensions have\nrarely been explored due to (1) the lack of datasets that allow fine-grained\nquantification of these trade-offs, and (2) the use of a single metric for\nmultiple dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG-Bench (Trade-offs in\nImage Generation), which spans 10 dimensions (Realism, Originality, Aesthetics,\nContent, Relation, Style, Knowledge, Ambiguity, Toxicity, and Bias), contains\n40,200 samples, and covers 132 pairwise dimensional subsets. Furthermore, we\ndevelop TRIGScore, a VLM-as-judge metric that automatically adapts to various\ndimensions. Based on TRIG-Bench and TRIGScore, we evaluate 14 models across T2I\nand I2I tasks. In addition, we propose the Relation Recognition System to\ngenerate the Dimension Trade-off Map (DTM) that visualizes the trade-offs among\nmodel-specific capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that DTM consistently\nprovides a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs between dimensions for\neach type of generative model.

Jakab and F. Kofler have shared last authorship", "summary": "Background Brain tumours are the most common solid malignancies in children,\nencompassing diverse histological, molecular subtypes and imaging features and\noutcomes. Paediatric brain tumours (PBTs), including high- and low-grade\ngliomas (HGG, LGG), medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and rarer forms, pose\ndiagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Deep learning (DL)-based segmentation\noffers promising tools for tumour delineation, yet its performance across\nheterogeneous PBT subtypes and MRI protocols remains uncertain. Methods A\nretrospective single-centre cohort of 174 paediatric patients with HGG, LGG,\nmedulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and other rarer subtypes was used. MRI\nsequences included T1, T1 post-contrast (T1-C), T2, and FLAIR. Manual\nannotations were provided for four tumour subregions: whole tumour (WT),\nT2-hyperintensity (T2H), enhancing tumour (ET), and cystic component (CC). A 3D\nnnU-Net model was trained and tested (121/53 split), with segmentation\nperformance assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and compared\nagainst intra- and inter-rater variability. Results The model achieved robust\nperformance for WT and T2H (mean DSC: 0.85), comparable to human annotator\nvariability (mean DSC: 0.86). ET segmentation was moderately accurate (mean\nDSC: 0.75), while CC performance was poor. Segmentation accuracy varied by\ntumour type, MRI sequence combination, and location.

While current diffusion-based approaches have demonstrated\nimpressive performance in approximating the data distribution, their inherent\nstochastic sampling process and inability to model exact densities limit their\neffectiveness in accurately capturing uncertainty.

Our analysis reveals a simple but fundamental\nflaw in existing methods: over-reliance on memorizing high-level semantic\nfeatures. UVOS inherently suffers from the deficiency of lacking fine-grained\ninformation due to the absence of pixel-level prior knowledge. Consequently,\nmemory design relying solely on high-level features, which predominantly\ncapture abstract semantic cues, is insufficient to generate precise\npredictions. To resolve this fundamental issue, we propose a novel hierarchical\nmemory architecture to incorporate both shallow- and high-level features for\nmemory, which leverages the complementary benefits of pixel and semantic\ninformation. Furthermore, to balance the simultaneous utilization of the pixel\nand semantic memory features, we propose a heterogeneous interaction mechanism\nto perform pixel-semantic mutual interactions, which explicitly considers their\ninherent feature discrepancies.

Recent research efforts have\nprogressively extended this paradigm to multimodal reasoning tasks.

However, despite\ntheir acclaim, these algorithms are limited to processing point correspondences\noriginating from a pair of views each one representing an instantaneous capture\nof the scene. Yet, in the case of rolling shutter cameras, or more recently,\nevent cameras, this synchronization breaks down. In this work, we present a\nunified approach for structure and linear motion estimation from 2D point\ncorrespondences with arbitrary timestamps, from an arbitrary set of views. By\nformulating the problem in terms of first-order dynamics and leveraging a\nconstant velocity motion model, we derive a novel, linear point incidence\nrelation allowing for the efficient recovery of both linear velocity and 3D\npoints with predictable degeneracies and solution multiplicities. Owing to its\ngeneral formulation, it can handle correspondences from a wide range of sensing\nmodalities such as global shutter, rolling shutter, and event cameras, and can\neven combine correspondences from different collocated sensors. We validate the\neffectiveness of our solver on both simulated and real-world data, where we\nshow consistent improvement across all modalities when compared to recent\napproaches.

A\ncommon countermeasure is trigger inversion -- reconstructing malicious\n\"shortcut\" patterns (triggers) inserted by an adversary during training.\nCurrent trigger-inversion methods typically search the full pixel space under\nspecific assumptions but offer no assurances that the estimated trigger is more\nthan an adversarial perturbation that flips the model output. Here, we propose\na data-free, zero-shot trigger-inversion strategy that restricts the search\nspace while avoiding strong assumptions on trigger appearance. Specifically, we\nincorporate a diffusion-based generator guided by the target classifier;\nthrough iterative generation, we produce candidate triggers that align with the\ninternal representations the model relies on for malicious behavior.

Studying AAA progression and\nrupture risk often involves in-silico blood flow modelling with computational\nfluid dynamics (CFD) and extraction of hemodynamic factors like time-averaged\nwall shear stress (TAWSS) or oscillatory shear index (OSI). However, CFD\nsimulations are known to be computationally demanding. Hence, in recent years,\ngeometric deep learning methods, operating directly on 3D shapes, have been\nproposed as compelling surrogates, estimating hemodynamic parameters in just a\nfew seconds. In this work, we propose a geometric deep learning approach to\nestimating hemodynamics in AAA patients, and study its generalisability to\ncommon factors of real-world variation. We propose an E(3)-equivariant deep\nlearning model utilising novel robust geometrical descriptors and projective\ngeometric algebra. Our model is trained to estimate transient WSS using a\ndataset of CT scans of 100 AAA patients, from which lumen geometries are\nextracted and reference CFD simulations with varying boundary conditions are\nobtained. Results show that the model generalizes well within the distribution,\nas well as to the external test set. Moreover, the model can accurately\nestimate hemodynamics across geometry remodelling and changes in boundary\nconditions. Furthermore, we find that a trained model can be applied to\ndifferent artery tree topologies, where new and unseen branches are added\nduring inference. Finally, we find that the model is to a large extent agnostic\nto mesh resolution. These results show the accuracy and generalisation of the\nproposed model, and highlight its potential to contribute to hemodynamic\nparameter estimation in clinical practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u4f30\u8ba1\u8179\u4e3b\u52a8\u8109\u7624\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u8840\u6d41\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u53d8\u5316\u56e0\u7d20\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff08CFD\uff09\u6a21\u62df\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5feb\u901f\u4f30\u8ba1\u8840\u6d41\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6f5c\u5728\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528E(3)-\u7b49\u53d8\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u578b\u7a33\u5065\u51e0\u4f55\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u548c\u6295\u5f71\u51e0\u4f55\u4ee3\u6570\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e100\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u7684CT\u626b\u63cf\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u5851\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u8840\u6d41\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8840\u6d41\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u53d1\u6325\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Currently, the main AIS assessment tool, X-rays, poses significant\nlimitations, including radiation exposure and limited accessibility in poor and\nremote areas. To address this problem, the current solutions are using RGB\nimages to analyze spine morphology. However, RGB images are highly susceptible\nto environmental factors, such as lighting conditions, compromising model\nstability and generalizability. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel\npipeline to accurately estimate the depth information of the unclothed back,\ncompensating for the limitations of 2D information, and then estimate spine\nmorphology by integrating both depth and surface information. To capture the\nsubtle depth variations of the back surface with precision, we design an\nadaptive multiscale feature learning network named Grid-Aware Multiscale\nAdaptive Network (GAMA-Net). This model uses dual encoders to extract both\npatch-level and global features, which are then interacted by the Patch-Based\nHybrid Attention (PBHA) module. The Adaptive Multiscale Feature Fusion (AMFF)\nmodule is used to dynamically fuse information in the decoder. As a result, our\ndepth estimation model achieves remarkable accuracy across three different\nevaluation metrics, with scores of nearly 78.2%, 93.6%, and 97.5%,\nrespectively.

Recent design approaches of dental crowns are\ncarried out using commercial dental design software. Once a scan of a\npreparation is uploaded to the software, a dental technician needs to manually\ndefine a precise margin line on the preparation surface, which constitutes a\nnon-repeatable and inconsistent procedure. This work proposes a new framework\nto determine margin lines automatically and accurately using deep learning. A\ndataset of incisor teeth was provided by a collaborating dental laboratory to\ntrain a deep learning segmentation model. A mesh-based neural network was\nmodified by changing its input channels and used to segment the prepared tooth\ninto two regions such that the margin line is contained within the boundary\nfaces separating the two regions. Next, k-fold cross-validation was used to\ntrain 5 models, and a voting classifier technique was used to combine their\nresults to enhance the segmentation. After that, boundary smoothing and\noptimization using the graph cut method were applied to refine the segmentation\nresults. Then, boundary faces separating the two regions were selected to\nrepresent the margin line faces. A spline was approximated to best fit the\ncenters of the boundary faces to predict the margin line. Our results show that\nan ensemble model combined with maximum probability predicted the highest\nnumber of successful test cases (7 out of 13) based on a maximum distance\nthreshold of 200 m (representing human error) between the predicted and ground\ntruth point clouds. It was also demonstrated that the better the quality of the\npreparation, the smaller the divergence between the predicted and ground truth\nmargin lines (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of -0.683).
