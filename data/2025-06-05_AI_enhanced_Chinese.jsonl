While conventional\nmethods for precise carbon accounting are hindered by substantial data\ncollection efforts, the rise of open data and advanced learning techniques\noffers a promising solution. Once an open data-based prediction model is\ndeveloped and trained, it can easily infer emissions for new areas based on\navailable open data. To address this, we incorporate two modalities of open\ndata, satellite images and point-of-interest (POI) data, to predict\nhigh-resolution urban carbon emissions, with satellite images providing\nmacroscopic and static and POI data offering fine-grained and relatively\ndynamic functionality information. However, estimating high-resolution carbon\nemissions presents two significant challenges: the intertwined and implicit\neffects of various functionalities on carbon emissions, and the complex spatial\ncontiguity correlations that give rise to the agglomeration effect. Our model,\nOpenCarbon, features two major designs that target the challenges: a\ncross-modality information extraction and fusion module to extract\ncomplementary functionality information from two modules and model their\ninteractions, and a neighborhood-informed aggregation module to capture the\nspatial contiguity correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our model's\nsuperiority, with a significant performance gain of 26.6\\% on R2.

With the emergence of high-performance pre-trained vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) such as CLIP, LLaVa and GPT-4V, the direction of using these\nmodels to replace time-consuming manual annotation workflows and achieve\n\"manual-annotation-free\" training for downstream tasks has become a highly\npromising research avenue. This paper focuses on learning from noisy partial\nlabels annotated by pre-trained VLMs and proposes an innovative collaborative\nconsistency regularization (Co-Reg) method. Unlike the symmetric noise\nprimarily addressed in traditional noisy label learning, the noise generated by\npre-trained models is instance-dependent, embodying the underlying patterns of\nthe pre-trained models themselves, which significantly increases the learning\ndifficulty for the model.

A common observation is that DiT latent noise vectors change slowly\nacross inference steps, which suggests that the DiT compute may be redundant\nacross steps. In this paper, we aim to speed up inference by reducing this\nredundancy, without additional training. We first study how activations change\nbetween steps in two state-of-the-art open-source DiTs. We find that just 5-25%\nof the values in attention and MLP explain 70-90% of the change in activations\nacross steps. This finding motivates our approach, Chipmunk, which uses dynamic\nsparsity at inference time to recompute only the fastest-changing intermediate\nactivations, while caching the rest. Dynamic sparsity introduces two systems\nchallenges: (1) sparse attention and MLP operations tend to underutilize GPU\ntensor cores; and (2) computing dynamic sparsity patterns at runtime and\ncaching activations both introduce overhead. To address these challenges,\nChipmunk first uses a voxel-based reordering of input tokens to introduce\ncolumn-wise sparsity. We implement column-sparse kernels utilizing efficient\nsparse gathers from global to shared GPU memory, achieving a 9.3x speedup at\n93% sparsity compared to highly-optimized dense baselines. Second, Chipmunk\noverlaps the computation of sparsity patterns and cache updates with other\nparts of the computation (e.g., second layer of the MLP) to hide the extra\nlatency. Chipmunk achieves up to 2.16x speedup on HunyuanVideo and 1.41x on\nFLUX.1-dev without compromising generation quality. Furthermore, we show that\nChipmunk can be stacked on top of full step caching, achieving a 3.72x speedup\non HunyuanVideo, a 2.67x speedup on WAN2.1, and a 2.25x speedup on FLUX.1-dev\nwith minimal quality impact.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aChipmunk\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u51cf\u5c11Diffusion Transformers\uff08DiTs\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "DiTs\u5728\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0DiT\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u5411\u91cf\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u53d8\u5316\u7f13\u6162\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b58\u5728\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "method": "Chipmunk\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ec5\u91cd\u65b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d8\u5316\u6700\u5feb\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7f13\u5b58\u5176\u4f59\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u5165\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u4f53\u7d20\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6838\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u53e0\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u7f13\u5b58\u66f4\u65b0\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cChipmunk\u5728HunyuanVideo\u548cFLUX.1-dev\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e862.16\u500d\u548c1.41\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u6b65\u9aa4\u7f13\u5b58\u540e\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "Chipmunk\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86DiTs\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

We employ a multimodal approach that integrates geo-referenced sound\nrecordings with both street-level and remote sensing imagery across three major\nglobal cities: London, New York, and Tokyo. Utilizing the AST model for audio,\nalong with CLIP and RemoteCLIP for imagery, as well as CLIPSeg and Seg-Earth OV\nfor semantic segmentation, we extract embeddings and class-level features to\nevaluate cross-modal similarity.

Results imply that for large (VGG16) and\nsmall (MobileNetV3-small) parameter deep CV models, adding >60% additional\nsynthetic images to a real image dataset during model training can narrow the\ntest-training accuracy gap to ~1-2% without a conclusive effect on test\naccuracy compared to using real world images alone. Likewise, adding <10%\nadditional real training images to synthetic only training sets decreased the\nclassification error rate in half, then decreasing further when adding more\nreal training images. For these cases tested, using synthetic images from\nrendering engines allow researchers to only use 10% of their real images during\ntraining, compared to the traditional 50-70%.

To address this challenge, we propose ControlThinker, a novel\nframework that employs a \"comprehend-then-generate\" paradigm. Firstly, by\nincentivizing the visual reasoning capability of a MLLM, latent semantics from\ncontrol images are mined to enrich text prompts.

To further tackle the uncertainty arising\nfrom the ambiguity of control images, we encourage broader exploration of\nreasoning trajectories and select the optimal one using a metric-based output\nreward model (ORM).

For example, a visually complex image (e.g., a cluttered room)\ninherently carries more information and thus deserves more tokens than a simple\nimage (e.g., a blank wall). To address this inefficiency, we propose DOVE, a\ndynamic vision encoder that produces a variable number of visual tokens (i.e.,\ncontinuous representation vectors) to reconstruct each image. Our results show\nthat DOVE significantly reduces the average number of tokens while maintaining\nhigh reconstruction quality.

However, variations in appearance and\npositioning often complicate the alignment of these references with the test\nimage, limiting detection accuracy. We observe that most anomalies manifest as\nlocal variations, meaning that even within anomalous images, valuable normal\ninformation remains. We argue that this information is useful and may be more\naligned with the anomalies since both the anomalies and the normal information\noriginate from the same image. Therefore, rather than relying on external\nnormality from the training set, we propose INP-Former, a novel method that\nextracts Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) directly from the test image.\nSpecifically, we introduce the INP Extractor, which linearly combines normal\ntokens to represent INPs. We further propose an INP Coherence Loss to ensure\nINPs can faithfully represent normality for the testing image. These INPs then\nguide the INP-guided Decoder to reconstruct only normal tokens, with\nreconstruction errors serving as anomaly scores. Additionally, we propose a\nSoft Mining Loss to prioritize hard-to-optimize samples during training.\nINP-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-class, multi-class,\nand few-shot AD tasks across MVTec-AD, VisA, and Real-IAD, positioning it as a\nversatile and universal solution for AD.

Existing methods fuse\nfeatures or distill knowledge from multiple modalities into a unified\nrepresentation, improving robustness but restricting each modality's ability to\nfully leverage its strengths in different situations. We reformulate\nmulti-modal semantic segmentation as a mask-level classification task and\npropose BiXFormer, which integrates Unified Modality Matching (UMM) and Cross\nModality Alignment (CMA) to maximize modality effectiveness and handle missing\nmodalities. Specifically, BiXFormer first categorizes multi-modal inputs into\nRGB and X, where X represents any non-RGB modalities, e.g., depth, allowing\nseparate processing for each. This design leverages the well-established\npretraining for RGB, while addressing the relative lack of attention to X\nmodalities. Then, we propose UMM, which includes Modality Agnostic Matching\n(MAM) and Complementary Matching (CM). MAM assigns labels to features from all\nmodalities without considering modality differences, leveraging each modality's\nstrengths.

Ultrasound-assisted diagnosis offers an objective yet effective way\nto assess fetal head position via two key parameters: Angle of Progression\n(AoP) and Head-Symphysis Distance (HSD), calculated by segmenting the fetal\nhead (FH) and pubic symphysis (PS), which aids clinicians in ensuring a smooth\ndelivery process. Therefore, accurate segmentation of FH and PS is crucial. In\nthis work, we propose a sparse self-attention network architecture with good\nperformance and high computational efficiency, named DSSAU-Net, for the\nsegmentation of FH and PS.

Traditional position encoding methods exhibit\nsignificant limitations due to lack of robustness and flexibility of position.\nTherefore, Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) was proposed to alleviate these\nissues, which integrates positional information by rotating the embeddings in\nthe attention mechanism. However, RoPE requires manually defined rotation\nmatrices with limited transformation space, constraining the model's capacity.\nIn this work, we propose ComRoPE, which generalizes RoPE by defining it in\nterms of trainable commuting angle matrices. Specifically, we demonstrate that\npairwise commutativity of these matrices is essential for RoPE to achieve\nscalability and positional robustness. We formally define the RoPE Equation,\nwhich is an essential condition that ensures consistent performance with\nposition offsets.

At present, models\nbased on Transformers have shone brightly in the field of super-resolution due\nto their ability to capture long-term dependencies in information.

Given a video, we fine-tune a lightweight appearance embedding\ninside a pre-trained general-purpose point tracker on a sparse set of annotated\nframes. These annotations can be obtained from human labelers or off-the-shelf\npose detectors. The fine-tuned model is then applied to the rest of the frames\nfor automatic labeling. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance at a\nreasonable annotation cost. We believe our pipeline offers a valuable tool for\nthe automatic quantification of animal behavior.

Recent advances in feed-forward 3D Gaussian sparse-view\nreconstruction methods provide an efficient solution for real-time novel view\nsynthesis by leveraging geometric priors learned from large-scale multi-view\ndatasets and computing 3D Gaussian centers via back-projection.

To address this problem, we propose Vision Remember, which\nis inserted between the LLM decoder layers to allow vision tokens to\nre-memorize vision features. Specifically, we retain multi-level vision\nfeatures and resample them with the vision tokens that have interacted with the\ntext token. During the resampling process, each vision token only attends to a\nlocal region in vision features, which is referred to as saliency-enhancing\nlocal attention. Saliency-enhancing local attention not only improves\ncomputational efficiency but also captures more fine-grained contextual\ninformation and spatial relationships within the region. Comprehensive\nexperiments on multiple visual understanding benchmarks validate the\neffectiveness of our method when combined with various Efficient Vision\nProjectors, showing performance gains without sacrificing efficiency. Based on\nVision Remember, LLaVA-VR with only 2B parameters is also superior to previous\nrepresentative MLLMs such as Tokenpacker-HD-7B and DeepSeek-VL-7B.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faVision Remember\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728LLM\u89e3\u7801\u5c42\u95f4\u63d2\u5165\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u591a\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u4e2d\u538b\u7f29\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9OCR\u548c\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u7b49\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u5728LLM\u89e3\u7801\u5c42\u95f4\u63d2\u5165Vision Remember\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u591a\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u91cd\u65b0\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0cLLaVA-VR\u4ec52B\u53c2\u6570\u5373\u4f18\u4e8e\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "Vision Remember\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6548\u7387\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u89c6\u89c9\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u3002"}}

This paper\nintroduces DiffCAP, a novel diffusion-based purification strategy that can\neffectively neutralize adversarial corruptions in VLMs. We observe that adding\nminimal noise to an adversarially corrupted image significantly alters its\nlatent embedding with respect to VLMs. Building on this insight, DiffCAP\ncumulatively injects random Gaussian noise into adversarially perturbed input\ndata. This process continues until the embeddings of two consecutive noisy\nimages reach a predefined similarity threshold, indicating a potential approach\nto neutralize the adversarial effect.

We argue that a robust object referring model\nshould be grounded, meaning its predictions should be both explainable and\nfaithful to the visual content. Specifically, it should satisfy two key\nproperties: 1) Verifiable, by producing interpretable reasoning that justifies\nits predictions and clearly links them to visual evidence; and 2) Trustworthy,\nby learning to abstain when no object in the image satisfies the given\nexpression. However, most methods treat referring as a direct bounding box\nprediction task, offering limited interpretability and struggling to reject\nexpressions with no matching object. In this work, we propose Rex-Thinker, a\nmodel that formulates object referring as an explicit CoT reasoning task. Given\na referring expression, we first identify all candidate object instances\ncorresponding to the referred object category. Rex-Thinker then performs\nstep-by-step reasoning over each candidate to assess whether it matches the\ngiven expression, before making a final prediction. To support this paradigm,\nwe construct a large-scale CoT-style referring dataset named HumanRef-CoT by\nprompting GPT-4o on the HumanRef dataset.

In the deconvolution part, blurry inputs are first\npreprocessed by the PPN with non-local operations. Then, the output frames from\nthe PPN are deblurred by the ABDN based on the frame alignment.

In 3D car tracking, our results show\nthat Contour Errors reduce functional failures (FPs/FNs) by 80% at close ranges\nand 60% at far ranges compared to IoU in the evaluation stage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5Contour Errors\uff08CEs\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u53473D\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf2D\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982IoU\u548cCPD\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u529f\u80fd\u5931\u8d25\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b49\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf2D\u5339\u914d\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982IoU\u548cCPD\uff09\u5728\u590d\u67423D\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u611f\u77e5\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u529f\u80fd\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5339\u914d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f66\u8f86\u6216\u76ee\u6807\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u7684Contour Errors\uff08CEs\uff09\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u5728\u8f66\u8f86\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u8f6e\u5ed3\u8bef\u5dee\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5339\u914d\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCEs\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf2D\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u57283D\u8f66\u8f86\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e2d\uff0c\u529f\u80fd\u5931\u8d25\u7387\uff08FPs/FNs\uff09\u5728\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u5206\u522b\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8680%\u548c60%\u3002", "conclusion": "Contour Errors\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u67423D\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

CS Video-to-Speech\ngeneration (CSV2S) task aims to convert the CS visual expressions (CS videos)\nof hearing-impaired individuals into comprehensible speech signals. Direct\ngeneration of speech from CS video (called single CSV2S) yields poor\nperformance due to insufficient CS data. Current research mostly focuses on CS\nRecognition (CSR), which convert video content into linguistic text. Based on\nthis, one straightforward way of CSV2S is to combine CSR with a Text-to-Speech\nsystem. This combined architecture relies on text as an intermediate medium for\nstepwise cross-modal alignment, which may lead to error propagation and\ntemporal misalignment between speech and video dynamics. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel approach that directly generates speech from CS\nvideos without relying on intermediate text. Building upon this, we propose\nUniCUE, the first unified framework for CSV2S, whose core innovation lies in\nthe integration of the CSR task that provides fine-grained visual-semantic\ninformation to facilitate speech generation from CS videos.

Recently, In-context\nConditioning emerged as a powerful paradigm for unified conditional video\ngeneration, which enables diverse controls by concatenating varying context\nconditioning signals with noisy video latents into a long unified token\nsequence and jointly processing them via full-attention, e.g., FullDiT. Despite\ntheir effectiveness, these methods face quadratic computation overhead as task\ncomplexity increases, hindering practical deployment. In this paper, we study\nthe efficiency bottleneck neglected in original in-context conditioning video\ngeneration framework. We begin with systematic analysis to identify two key\nsources of the computation inefficiencies: the inherent redundancy within\ncontext condition tokens and the computational redundancy in context-latent\ninteractions throughout the diffusion process. Based on these insights, we\npropose FullDiT2, an efficient in-context conditioning framework for general\ncontrollability in both video generation and editing tasks, which innovates\nfrom two key perspectives. Firstly, to address the token redundancy, FullDiT2\nleverages a dynamic token selection mechanism to adaptively identify important\ncontext tokens, reducing the sequence length for unified full-attention.\nAdditionally, a selective context caching mechanism is devised to minimize\nredundant interactions between condition tokens and video latents. Extensive\nexperiments on six diverse conditional video editing and generation tasks\ndemonstrate that FullDiT2 achieves significant computation reduction and 2-3\ntimes speedup in averaged time cost per diffusion step, with minimal\ndegradation or even higher performance in video generation quality.

Previous methods often rely on task-specific\narchitectures (e.g., additional adapter modules) or dedicated customizations\n(e.g., DDIM inversion), which limit the integration of versatile editing\nconditions and the unification of various editing tasks. In this paper, we\nintroduce UNified In-Context Video Editing (UNIC), a simple yet effective\nframework that unifies diverse video editing tasks within a single model in an\nin-context manner. To achieve this unification, we represent the inputs of\nvarious video editing tasks as three types of tokens: the source video tokens,\nthe noisy video latent, and the multi-modal conditioning tokens that vary\naccording to the specific editing task. Based on this formulation, our key\ninsight is to integrate these three types into a single consecutive token\nsequence and jointly model them using the native attention operations of DiT,\nthereby eliminating the need for task-specific adapter designs. Nevertheless,\ndirect task unification under this framework is challenging, leading to severe\ntoken collisions and task confusion due to the varying video lengths and\ndiverse condition modalities across tasks. To address these, we introduce\ntask-aware RoPE to facilitate consistent temporal positional encoding, and\ncondition bias that enables the model to clearly differentiate different\nediting tasks. This allows our approach to adaptively perform different video\nediting tasks by referring the source video and varying condition tokens \"in\ncontext\", and support flexible task composition. To validate our method, we\nconstruct a unified video editing benchmark containing six representative video\nediting tasks. Results demonstrate that our unified approach achieves superior\nperformance on each task and exhibits emergent task composition abilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "UNIC\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u4e09\u79cd\u4ee4\u724c\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528DiT\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7279\u5b9a\u9002\u914d\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7f16\u8f91\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7edf\u4e00\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u6e90\u89c6\u9891\u4ee4\u724c\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u89c6\u9891\u6f5c\u5728\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5RoPE\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u504f\u7f6e\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4efb\u52a1\u7ec4\u5408\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "UNIC\u6846\u67b6\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate DUAL's\neffectiveness across multiple domains: in computer vision tasks, it achieves\nsubstantial improvements of 7.1% accuracy on CIFAR-10, 6.5% accuracy on\nCIFAR-100, and 2.3% accuracy on Tiny-ImageNet; in multi-modal learning, it\ndemonstrates consistent gains of 4.1% accuracy on CMU-MOSEI and 2.8% accuracy\non CMU-MOSI for sentiment analysis, while achieving 1.4% accuracy improvements\non MISR.

However, practical instrumentation and\ngeometric constraints limit the number of acoustic sensors available around the\nimaging target, leading to sparsity in sensor data. Traditional photoacoustic\n(PA) image reconstruction methods, when directly applied to sparse PA data,\nproduce severe artifacts. Additionally, these traditional methods do not\nconsider the inter-frame relationships in dynamic imaging. Temporal resolution\nis crucial for dynamic photoacoustic imaging, which is fundamentally limited by\nthe low repetition rate (e.g., 20 Hz) and high cost of high-power laser\ntechnology. Recently, Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has emerged as a\npowerful deep learning tool for solving inverse problems with sparse data, by\ncharacterizing signal properties as continuous functions of their coordinates\nin an unsupervised manner. In this work, we propose an INR-based method to\nimprove dynamic photoacoustic image reconstruction from sparse-views and\nenhance temporal resolution, using only spatiotemporal coordinates as input.\nSpecifically, the proposed INR represents dynamic photoacoustic images as\nimplicit functions and encodes them into a neural network. The weights of the\nnetwork are learned solely from the acquired sparse sensor data, without the\nneed for external training datasets or prior images. Benefiting from the strong\nimplicit continuity regularization provided by INR, as well as explicit\nregularization for low-rank and sparsity, our proposed method outperforms\ntraditional reconstruction methods under two different sparsity conditions,\neffectively suppressing artifacts and ensuring image quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff08INR\uff09\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5149\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4f2a\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5149\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u4e25\u91cd\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u8003\u8651\u52a8\u6001\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e27\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u6fc0\u5149\u6280\u672f\u7684\u4f4e\u91cd\u590d\u7387\u548c\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528INR\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u5149\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u9690\u5f0f\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u65f6\u7a7a\u5750\u6807\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6216\u5148\u9a8c\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4e\u79e9\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u663e\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u7a00\u758f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u4f2a\u5f71\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "INR\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u52a8\u6001\u5149\u58f0\u6210\u50cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

By comparing both the original base image (before exposure\nto the wound) and the wound-exposed image, we developed automated computer\nvision techniques to compare density changes between the two assay images,\nwhich allow us to automatically determine the severity of the wound. The iOS\napp ensures accurate data collection and presents actionable insights, despite\nchallenges such as variations in camera configurations and ambient conditions.\nThe proposed integrated sensor and iOS app will allow healthcare professionals\nto monitor wound conditions real-time, track healing progress, and assess\ncritical parameters related to wound care.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u591a\u5206\u6790\u7269\u76843D\u6253\u5370\u68c0\u6d4b\u88c5\u7f6e\u548ciOS\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u8db3\u6e83\u75a1\uff08DFUs\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u6280\u672f\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u4f24\u53e3\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u8db3\u6e83\u75a1\uff08DFUs\uff09\u6bcf\u5e74\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\u91cf\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\u975e\u6108\u5408\u6027\u6e83\u75a1\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u6cbb\u7597\u6210\u672c\u548c\u622a\u80a2\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u54083D\u6253\u5370\u7684\u591a\u5206\u6790\u7269\u68c0\u6d4b\u88c5\u7f6e\u548ciOS\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u6280\u672f\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f24\u53e3\u66b4\u9732\u524d\u540e\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f24\u53e3\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u76f8\u673a\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u96c6\u6210\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548ciOS\u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u5e2e\u52a9\u533b\u7597\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u4f24\u53e3\u72b6\u51b5\uff0c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6108\u5408\u8fdb\u5ea6\u3002"}}

In recent decades,\nsurgical treatments for craniosynostosis have significantly improved, leading\nto reduced invasiveness, faster recovery, and less blood loss. At Great Ormond\nStreet Hospital (GOSH), the main surgical treatment for patients diagnosed with\nsagittal craniosynostosis (SC) is spring assisted cranioplasty (SAC). This\nprocedure involves a 15x15 mm2 osteotomy, where two springs are inserted to\ninduce distraction. Despite the numerous advantages of this surgical technique\nfor patients, the outcome remains unpredictable due to the lack of efficient\npreoperative planning tools. The surgeon's experience and the baby's age are\ncurrently relied upon to determine the osteotomy location and spring selection.\nPrevious tools for predicting the surgical outcome of SC relied on finite\nelement modeling (FEM), which involved computed tomography (CT) imaging and\nrequired engineering expertise and lengthy calculations. The main goal of this\nresearch is to develop a real-time prediction tool for the surgical outcome of\npatients, eliminating the need for CT scans to minimise radiation exposure\nduring preoperative planning. The proposed methodology involves creating\npersonalised synthetic skulls based on three-dimensional (3D) photographs,\nincorporating population average values of suture location, skull thickness,\nand soft tissue properties. A machine learning (ML) surrogate model is employed\nto achieve the desired surgical outcome. The resulting multi-output support\nvector regressor model achieves a R2 metric of 0.95 and MSE and MAE below 0.13.\nFurthermore, in the future, this model could not only simulate various surgical\nscenarios but also provide optimal parameters for achieving a maximum cranial\nindex (CI).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u7167\u7247\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9885\u7f1d\u65e9\u95ed\u624b\u672f\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11CT\u626b\u63cf\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u9885\u7f1d\u65e9\u95ed\u624b\u672f\u7ed3\u679c\u96be\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u533b\u751f\u7ecf\u9a8c\u548c\u5a74\u513f\u5e74\u9f84\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u6548\u672f\u524d\u89c4\u5212\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u75283D\u7167\u7247\u521b\u5efa\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5408\u6210\u5934\u9aa8\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7fa4\u5e73\u5747\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u624b\u672f\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684R2\u8fbe\u52300.95\uff0cMSE\u548cMAE\u4f4e\u4e8e0.13\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u8f90\u5c04\u66b4\u9732\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u8fd8\u80fd\u6a21\u62df\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u4f18\u53c2\u6570\u3002"}}

To reconstruct these objects from CT\nprojections, a common approach is to divide the projections into several\ncollections based on their motion phases and perform reconstruction within each\ncollection, assuming they originate from a static object. This describes the\ngating-based method, which is the standard approach for time-periodic\nreconstruction.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACL significantly improves\nCL performance across benchmarks and integrated methods, offering a versatile\nsolution for PTM-based CL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aACL\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6838\u5fc3\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CL\uff09\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e4b\u524d\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff08PTM\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u51bb\u7ed3PTM\u4e3b\u5e72\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u5851\u6027\uff1b\u800c\u5b8c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03PTM\u5219\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002ACL\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "ACL\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6bcf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u524d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u9636\u6bb5\u8c03\u6574PTM\u4e3b\u5e72\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\uff08prompt tuning\uff09\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cACL\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "ACL\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8ePTM\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u3002"}}

Real-world evaluation is often challenging due to safety concerns\nand a lack of reproducibility, whereas closed-loop simulation can face\ninsufficient realism or high computational costs. Open-loop evaluation, while\nbeing efficient and data-driven, relies on metrics that generally overlook\ncompounding errors. In this paper, we propose pseudo-simulation, a novel\nparadigm that addresses these limitations. Pseudo-simulation operates on real\ndatasets, similar to open-loop evaluation, but augments them with synthetic\nobservations generated prior to evaluation using 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our key\nidea is to approximate potential future states the AV might encounter by\ngenerating a diverse set of observations that vary in position, heading, and\nspeed. Our method then assigns a higher importance to synthetic observations\nthat best match the AV's likely behavior using a novel proximity-based\nweighting scheme. This enables evaluating error recovery and the mitigation of\ncausal confusion, as in closed-loop benchmarks, without requiring sequential\ninteractive simulation. We show that pseudo-simulation is better correlated\nwith closed-loop simulations (R^2=0.8) than the best existing open-loop\napproach (R^2=0.7).
