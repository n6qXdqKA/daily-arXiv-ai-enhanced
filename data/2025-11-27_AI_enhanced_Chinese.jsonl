This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings. This work contributes to the growing understanding of privacy risks in MMs and provides evidence on neuro VLMs privacy threat resilience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u65e5\u76ca\u7a81\u51fa\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u795e\u7ecf\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u62d3\u6251\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6846\u67b6(tau)\uff0c\u5728BLIP\u3001PaliGemma 2\u548cViT-GPT2\u4e09\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528COCO\u3001CC3M\u548cNoCaps\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u53d8\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728BLIP\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u53d8\u4f53VLM\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5e73\u5747ROC-AUC\u4e0b\u964d24%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\uff08\u751f\u6210\u5b57\u5e55\u4e0e\u53c2\u8003\u5b57\u5e55\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff09\u5728MPNet\u548cROUGE-2\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u4f3c\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u4e5f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u795e\u7ecf\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u62b5\u5fa1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8bc1\u636e\u3002"}}

Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation.\n  Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios.

Recent advances in mobile edge computing have made it possible to offload computation-intensive object detection to edge servers equipped with high-accuracy neural networks, while lightweight and fast object tracking algorithms run locally on devices. This hybrid approach offers a promising solution but introduces a new challenge: deciding when to perform edge detection versus local tracking. To address this, we formulate two long-term optimization problems for both single-device and multi-device scenarios, taking into account the temporal correlation of consecutive frames and the dynamic conditions of mobile edge networks.

In multi-device setting, we further enhance LTED-Ada using federated learning to enable collaborative policy training across devices, thereby improving its generalization to unseen frame rates and performance requirements.

We present DeeAD, a training-free, action-guided early-exit framework that accelerates VLA planning by evaluating the physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories. Instead of relying on confidence scores, DeeAD terminates inference when predicted trajectories align with lightweight planning priors (e.g., Navigation or Low-precision Planning) within a tolerable deviation (<2m).

Our method builds on a DINOv2 model pretrained to detect synthetic images on the B-Free dataset. We add a linear classification head on top of the Vision Transformer's patch embeddings to predict manipulations at a $14\\times 14$ patch resolution. The head is trained to focus on semantically altered regions, treating non-semantic edits as part of the original content. Because the ViT accepts only fixed-size inputs, we use a sliding-window strategy to aggregate predictions over larger images; the resulting heatmaps are post-processed to refine the estimated binary manipulation masks. Empirical results show that DinoLizer surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors on a range of inpainting datasets derived from different generative models. It remains robust to common post-processing operations such as resizing, noise addition, and JPEG (double) compression. On average, DinoLizer achieves a 12\\% higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) than the next best model, with even greater gains after post-processing. Our experiments with off-the-shelf DINOv2 demonstrate the strong representational power of Vision Transformers for this task.

However, as no existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance, the capacity remains unknown. To address this, we introduce CANVAS, a benchmark for VLMs on tool-based user interface design. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories (e.g., onboarding, messaging). In each task, a VLM updates the design step-by-step through context-based tool invocations (e.g., create a rectangle as a button background), linked to design software. Specifically, CANVAS incorporates two task types: (i) design replication evaluates the ability to reproduce a whole UI screen; (ii) design modification evaluates the ability to modify a specific part of an existing screen.

This standard paradigm results in encoders that process images agnostically, without regard to the specific downstream task or text query. To address this limitation, we propose the Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE), which generates image representations conditioned on the input text query. VLMs equipped with TIE outperform their conventional counterparts by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine image-to-text benchmarks at the 1B and 3B scales, respectively, with gains reaching up to 6 points on tasks such as DocVQA and InfoVQA.

However, most existing methods rely on dense or full-scene observations, limiting their effectiveness in constrained or partial view environment. To address this challenge, we introduce SMARC, a unified model for Surface MAterial Reconstruction and Classification from minimal visual input. By giving only a single 10% contiguous patch of the image, SMARC recognizes and reconstructs the full RGB surface while simultaneously classifying the material category. Our architecture combines a Partial Convolutional U-Net with a classification head, enabling both spatial inpainting and semantic understanding under extreme observation sparsity. We compared SMARC against five models including convolutional autoencoders [17], Vision Transformer (ViT) [13], Masked Autoencoder (MAE) [5], Swin Transformer [9], and DETR [2] using Touch and Go dataset [16] of real-world surface textures. SMARC achieves state-of-the-art results with a PSNR of 17.55 dB and a material classification accuracy of 85.10%.

However, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, especially when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed. Inspired by how humans comprehend long videos - by first skimming globally and then examining relevant clips for details - we introduce LongVT, an end-to-end agentic framework that enables \"Thinking with Long Videos\" via interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought. Specifically, we exploit LMMs' inherent temporal grounding ability as a native video cropping tool to zoom in on a specific video clip and resample finer-grained video frames. This global-to-local reasoning loop continues until answers are grounded in retrieved visual evidence. Given the scarcity of fine-grained question-answering (QA) data for the long video reasoning task, we curate and will release a data suite named VideoSIAH to facilitate both training and evaluation. Specifically, our training dataset consists of 247.9K samples for tool-integrated cold-start supervised fine-tuning, 1.6K samples for agentic reinforcement learning, and 15.4K samples for agentic reinforcement fine-tuning, respectively. Our evaluation benchmark consists of 1,280 QA pairs that are carefully curated through a semi-automatic data pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation. With a meticulously designed three-stage training strategy and extensive empirical validation, LongVT consistently outperforms existing strong baselines across four challenging long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks.

In this paper we connect the various dynamic sampling methods by developing and analyzing a novel operator which generalizes existing methods, which we term \"warping\". Warping provides a minimal implementation of dynamic sampling which is amenable to analysis, and can be used to reconstruct existing architectures including deformable convolutions, active convolutional units, and spatial transformer networks. Using our formalism, we provide statistical analysis of the operator by modeling the inputs as both IID variables and homogeneous random fields. Extending this analysis, we discover a unique asymmetry between the forward and backward pass of the model training. We demonstrate that these mechanisms represent an entirely different class of orthogonal operators to the traditional translationally invariant operators defined by convolutions. With a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical investigation, we find the conditions necessary to ensure stable training of dynamic sampling networks. In addition, statistical analysis of discretization effects are studied. Finally, we introduce a novel loss landscape visualization which utilizes gradient update information directly, to better understand learning behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a\"warping\"\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u524d\u5411\u548c\u540e\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u786e\u4fdd\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u7f51\u7edc\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5df2\u8bc1\u660e\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5c1a\u672a\u7edf\u4e00\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7b97\u5b50\u6765\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u5206\u6790\u5404\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u79f0\u4e3a\"warping\"\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u5b50\u6982\u62ec\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u5377\u79ef\u3001\u4e3b\u52a8\u5377\u79ef\u5355\u5143\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u6362\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3aIID\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u9f50\u6b21\u968f\u673a\u573a\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u524d\u5411\u548c\u540e\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5e73\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u5377\u79ef\u7b97\u5b50\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u7b97\u5b50\u7c7b\u522b\u3002\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u786e\u4fdd\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u7f51\u7edc\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "warping\u7b97\u5b50\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

However, most existing NeRF frameworks require complete retraining when new views are introduced incrementally, limiting their applicability in domains where data arrives sequentially. This limitation is particularly problematic in satellite-based terrain analysis, where regions are repeatedly observed over time. Incremental refinement of NeRFs remains underexplored, and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting when past data is unavailable. We propose $\u0394$-NeRF, a unique modular residual framework for incremental NeRF refinement. $\u0394$-NeRF introduces several novel techniques including: (1) a residual controller that injects per-layer corrections into a frozen base NeRF, enabling refinement without access to past data; (2) an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism that prevents overcorrection by adaptively combining base and refined predictions; and (3) a view selection strategy that reduces training data by up to 47\\% while maintaining performance. Additionally, we employ knowledge distillation to compress the enhanced model into a compact student network (20\\% of original size). Experiments on satellite imagery demonstrate that $\u0394$-NeRF achieves performance comparable to joint training while reducing training time by 30-42\\%. $\u0394$-NeRF consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving an improvement of up to 43.5\\% in PSNR over naive fine-tuning and surpassing joint training on some metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u0394-NeRF\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u91cfNeRF\u7cbe\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6b8b\u5dee\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u4e0d\u8bbf\u95ee\u8fc7\u53bb\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709NeRF\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u89c6\u56fe\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u536b\u661f\u5730\u5f62\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u987a\u5e8f\u5230\u8fbe\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u589e\u91cf\u7cbe\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1) \u6b8b\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5411\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u57fa\u7840NeRF\u6ce8\u5165\u9010\u5c42\u4fee\u6b63\uff1b2) \u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u7cbe\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b3) \u89c6\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff1b4) \u4f7f\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5c06\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u5b66\u751f\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\uff0c\u0394-NeRF\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1130-42%\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u51cf\u5c1147%\u3002PSNR\u6bd4\u7b80\u5355\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u534743.5%\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u0394-NeRF\u4e3a\u589e\u91cfNeRF\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u536b\u661f\u5730\u5f62\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Unlike conventional methods relying on annotated datasets or handcrafted rules, StM splits a large corpus of unlabeled videos into dynamic foreground and background layers, then self-composes them to learn how dynamic subjects interact with diverse scenes. This process enables the model to learn the complex compositional dynamics required for realistic video generation. StM introduces a novel transformation-aware training pipeline that utilizes a multi-layer fusion and augmentation to achieve affordance-aware composition, alongside an identity-preservation loss that maintains foreground fidelity during blending. Experiments show StM outperforms SoTA methods in both quantitative benchmarks and in humans/VLLM-based qualitative evaluations.

These priors are computationally expensive and require extensive training on massive datasets. In this work, we challenge the necessity of a trained prior at all by employing Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a training-free and data-free alternative, to replace the need for a prior. OVI initializes a latent visual representation from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes it to maximize the cosine similarity with input textual prompt embedding. We further propose two novel constraints, a Mahalanobis-based and a Nearest-Neighbor loss, to regularize the OVI optimization process toward the distribution of realistic images. Our experiments, conducted on Kandinsky 2.2, show that OVI can serve as an alternative to traditional priors. More importantly, our analysis reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation benchmarks like T2I-CompBench++, where simply using the text embedding as a prior achieves surprisingly high scores, despite lower perceptual quality. Our constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity over this baseline, with the Nearest-Neighbor approach proving particularly effective, achieving quantitative scores comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, indicating that the idea merits further investigation.

Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision. Across multiple public centerline datasets, RefTr achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA, while offering faster inference and substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating its potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "RefTr\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8840\u7ba1\u6811\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\u76843D\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af\u7cbe\u70bc\u6c47\u5408\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u8840\u7ba1\u6811\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ebf\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u6811\u72b6\u62d3\u6251\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u9057\u6f0f\u5c0f\u5206\u652f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u81f4\u547d\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u7684\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ebf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Producer-Refiner\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u3002Producer\u63d0\u51fa\u521d\u59cb\u6c47\u5408\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0cRefiner\u5faa\u73af\u7cbe\u70bc\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f68\u8ff9\u5f62\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6c47\u5408\u8f68\u8ff9\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6811\u72b6\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u6811\u56fe\u7684\u975e\u6781\u5927\u503c\u6291\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u5408\u5e76\u91cd\u590d\u5206\u652f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRefTr\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524dSOTA\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c112.4\u500d\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "RefTr\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f5c\u4e3a3D\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u8840\u7ba1\u6811\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65b0SOTA\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Despite recent progress in depth estimation and depth-of-field rendering, research remains constrained by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity, real stereo DSLR datasets, limiting real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data as shown extensively in literature. We present the first high-resolution (5472$\\times$3648px) stereo DSLR dataset with 18000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across complex real scenes and capturing the optical realism and complexity of professional camera systems. For 9 scenes with varying scene complexity, lighting and background, images are captured with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations in 2000 images per scene. This full-range optics coverage enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for monocular and stereo depth estimation, shallow depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Each focal configuration has a dedicated calibration image set, supporting evaluation of classical and learning based methods for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. The dataset features challenging visual elements such as multi-scale optical illusions, reflective surfaces, mirrors, transparent glass walls, fine-grained details, and natural / artificial ambient light variations. This work attempts to bridge the realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics, and demonstrates challenges with the current state-of-the-art monocular, stereo depth and depth-of-field methods.

A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval.

In contrast with previous approaches, which estimate the parameters sequentially and thus are prone to error propagation, our algorithm estimates all the parameters simultaneously by solving a novel optimisation problem. By assuming that fog is only locally homogeneous, our method effectively handles real-world fog, which is often globally inhomogeneous. The proposed algorithm can be easily used as an add-on module in existing visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) or odometry systems in the presence of fog. In order to assess our method, we also created a new dataset, the Stereo Driving In Real Fog (SDIRF), consisting of high-quality, consecutive stereo frames of real, foggy road scenes under a variety of visibility conditions, totalling over 40 minutes and 34k frames. As a first-of-its-kind, SDIRF contains the camera's photometric parameters calibrated in a lab environment, which is a prerequisite for correctly applying the atmospheric scattering model to foggy images. The dataset also includes the counterpart clear data of the same routes recorded in overcast weather, which is useful for companion work in image defogging and depth reconstruction. We conducted extensive experiments using both synthetic foggy data and real foggy sequences from SDIRF to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over prior methods. Our method not only produces the most accurate estimates on synthetic data, but also adapts better to real fog.

This task poses significant challenges due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models, such as SAM2, non-trivial to apply directly. To address this, we present V^2-SAM, a unified cross-view object correspondence framework that adapts SAM2 from single-view segmentation to cross-view correspondence through two complementary prompt generators. Specifically, the Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor), built upon DINOv3 features, establishes geometry-aware correspondences and, for the first time, unlocks coordinate-based prompting for SAM2 in cross-view scenarios, while the Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) enhances appearance-guided cues via a novel visual prompt matcher that aligns ego-exo representations from both feature and structural perspectives. To effectively exploit the strengths of both prompts, we further adopt a multi-expert design and introduce a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) that adaptively selects the most reliable expert based on cyclic consistency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of V^2-SAM, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).", "AI": {"tldr": "V^2-SAM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u8c61\u5bf9\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5c06SAM2\u4ece\u5355\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u5272\u9002\u914d\u5230\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u8c61\u5bf9\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982ego-exo\u5bf9\u5e94\uff09\u7531\u4e8e\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u5916\u89c2\u7684\u5267\u70c8\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u5982SAM2\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faV^2-SAM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4ea4\u53c9\u89c6\u56fe\u951a\u70b9\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08V^2-Anchor\uff09\u5efa\u7acb\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u5e94\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ea4\u53c9\u89c6\u56fe\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08V^2-Visual\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u5916\u89c2\u5f15\u5bfc\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u540e\u9a8c\u5faa\u73af\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff08PCCS\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u3002", "result": "\u5728Ego-Exo4D\u3001DAVIS-2017\u548cHANDAL-X\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "V^2-SAM\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u8c61\u5bf9\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5916\u89c2\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, existing methods tend to either under-optimise or over-optimise (reward hack) the target reward function. We propose Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA), which aligns diffusion models by optimising the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance, rather than manipulating latent or noise variables. Due to the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space, this ensures alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold and prevents reward hacking (exploiting non-semantic noise patterns to improve the reward). Since the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance serves as the anchor for the model's generative distribution, Null-TTA directly steers model's generative distribution towards the target reward rather than just adjusting the samples, even without updating model parameters. Thanks to these desirable properties, we show that Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalisation.

Popular architectures such as SIREN, WIRE, and FINER demonstrate the potential of INR for capturing fine-grained image details.

To address these limitations, we propose GaINeR: Geometry-Aware Implicit Network Representation, a novel framework for 2D images that combines trainable Gaussian distributions with a neural network-based INR. For a given image coordinate, the model retrieves the K nearest Gaussians, aggregates distance-weighted embeddings, and predicts the RGB value via a neural network.

Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \\pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \\pm 0.113 to 0.993 \\pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \\pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \\pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm.

Our method encourages smoothness in the intermediate-layer embeddings of consecutive frames by modeling their changes as a Gaussian Random Walk (GRW). This penalizes abrupt representational shifts, thereby promoting low-acceleration solutions that better align with the natural temporal coherence inherent in videos. By leveraging this enforced smoothness, lightweight models can more effectively capture complex temporal dynamics. Applied to such models, our technique yields a 3.8% to 6.4% accuracy improvement on Kinetics-600. Notably, the MoViNets model family trained with our smooth regularization improves the current state of the art by 3.8% to 6.1% within their respective FLOP constraints, while MobileNetV3 and the MoViNets-Stream family achieve gains of 4.9% to 6.4% over prior state-of-the-art models with comparable memory footprints.

Motivated by the goal of understanding how neurons encode information, compositional explanations leverage logical relationships between concepts to express the spatial alignment between neuron activations and human knowledge. However, these explanations rely on human-annotated datasets, restricting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a framework for the vision domain that allows users to probe neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets. Specifically, the framework leverages masks generated by open vocabulary semantic segmentation to compute open vocabulary compositional explanations. The proposed framework consists of three steps: specifying arbitrary concepts, generating semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and deriving compositional explanations from these masks. The paper compares the proposed framework with previous methods for computing compositional explanations both in terms of quantitative metrics and human interpretability, analyzes the differences in explanations when shifting from human-annotated data to model-annotated data, and showcases the additional capabilities provided by the framework in terms of flexibility of the explanations with respect to the tasks and properties of interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u751f\u6210\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5373\u53ef\u63a2\u7d22\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u548c\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4e09\u6b65\u9aa4\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u6307\u5b9a\u4efb\u610f\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u3001\u4ece\u63a9\u7801\u63a8\u5bfc\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4ece\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u989d\u5916\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u548c\u901a\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Manual measurement of this growth is time-consuming and often imprecise, as it is typically performed along 4 to 8 radial directions on a cross-sectional disc. In recent years, automated algorithms and datasets have emerged to enhance accuracy and automate the delineation of annual rings in cross-sectional images.\n  To address the scarcity of wood cross-section data, we introduce the UruDendro4 dataset, a collection of 102 image samples of Pinus taeda L., each manually annotated with annual growth rings. Unlike existing public datasets, UruDendro4 includes samples extracted at multiple heights along the stem, allowing for the volumetric modeling of annual growth using manually delineated rings. This dataset (images and annotations) allows the development of volumetric models for annual wood estimation based on cross-sectional imagery.\n  Additionally, we provide a performance baseline for automatic ring detection on this dataset using state-of-the-art methods. The highest performance was achieved by the DeepCS-TRD method, with a mean Average Precision of 0.838, a mean Average Recall of 0.782, and an Adapted Rand Error score of 0.084. A series of ablation experiments were conducted to empirically validate the final parameter configuration. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that training a learning model including this dataset improves the model's generalization in the tree-ring detection task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86UruDendro4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b102\u4e2a\u706b\u70ac\u677e\u6a2a\u622a\u9762\u56fe\u50cf\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6811\u6728\u5e74\u8f6e\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u652f\u6301\u5e74\u8f6e\u4f53\u79ef\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86DeepCS-TRD\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6728\u6750\u6a2a\u622a\u9762\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u624b\u52a8\u6d4b\u91cf\u5e74\u8f6e\u751f\u957f\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e74\u8f6e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165UruDendro4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b102\u4e2a\u706b\u70ac\u677e\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u90fd\u6709\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u5e74\u8f6e\u3002\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b\u4ece\u6811\u5e72\u4e0d\u540c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5e74\u8f6e\u4f53\u79ef\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u81ea\u52a8\u5e74\u8f6e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "DeepCS-TRD\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea60.838\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u53ec\u56de\u73870.782\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5170\u5fb7\u8bef\u5dee0.084\u3002\u5305\u542b\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e74\u8f6e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "UruDendro4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u6728\u6750\u6a2a\u622a\u9762\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5e74\u8f6e\u4f53\u79ef\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5e74\u8f6e\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We propose BUSTR, a multitask vision-language framework that generates BUS reports without requiring paired image-report supervision. BUSTR constructs reports from structured descriptors (e.g., BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, learns descriptor-aware visual representations with a multi-head Swin encoder trained using a multitask loss over dataset-specific descriptor sets, and aligns visual and textual tokens via a dual-level objective that combines token-level cross-entropy with a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations. We evaluate BUSTR on two public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, which differ in size and available descriptors. Across both datasets, BUSTR consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key targets such as BI-RADS category and pathology.

However, in practical editing scenarios of the modern content creation landscape, many compositions are not intended to preserve realism. Instead, users of online platforms motivated by gaining community recognition often aim to create content that is more artistic, playful, or socially engaging. Taking inspiration from this observation, we define the expressive composition task, a new formulation of image composition that embraces stylistic diversity and looser placement logic, reflecting how users edit images on real-world creative platforms. To address this underexplored problem, we present StickerNet, a two-stage framework that first determines the composition type, then predicts placement parameters such as opacity, mask, location, and scale accordingly. Unlike prior work that constructs datasets by simulating object placements on real images, we directly build our dataset from 1.8 million editing actions collected on an anonymous online visual creation and editing platform, each reflecting user-community validated placement decisions. This grounding in authentic editing behavior ensures strong alignment between task definition and training supervision. User studies and quantitative evaluations show that StickerNet outperforms common baselines and closely matches human placement behavior, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning from real-world editing patterns despite the inherent ambiguity of the task.

Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing overlapping coverage areas of cameras. It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time.

While federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training without raw data exchange, recent studies show that model gradients in conventional FL remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, potentially exposing sensitive medical information. This paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification. The approach leverages the ViT CLS token as a compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation, encrypting these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server. We demonstrate that encrypting CLS tokens achieves a 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Through evaluation on a three-client federated setup for lung cancer histopathology classification, we show that gradients are highly susceptible to model inversion attacks (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741), enabling near-perfect image reconstruction. In contrast, the proposed CLS-protected HE approach prevents such attacks while enabling encrypted inference directly on ciphertexts, requiring only 326 KB of encrypted data transmission per aggregation round.

While mainstream training-free diffusion-based methods have greatly advanced style transfer in recent years, their reliance on computationally inversion processes compromises efficiency and introduces visual distortions when inversion is inaccurate. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \\textit{inversion-free} style transfer framework based on dual rectified flows, which tackles the challenge of finding an unknown stylized distribution from two distinct inputs (content and style images), \\textit{only with forward pass}. Our approach predicts content and style trajectories in parallel, then fuses them through a dynamic midpoint interpolation that integrates velocities from both paths while adapting to the evolving stylized image.

Though effective, current systems adopt a dual-branch design that requires reference images at test time, which limits deployability and adds latency and data-collection burden. We introduce a Ref-COD framework that distills references into a class-prototype memory during training and synthesizes a reference vector at inference via a query-conditioned mixture of prototypes. Concretely, we maintain an EMA-updated prototype per category and predict mixture weights from the query to produce a guidance vector without any test-time references. To bridge the representation gap between reference statistics and camouflaged query features, we propose a bidirectional attention alignment module that adapts both the query features and the class representation. Thus, our approach yields a simple, efficient path to Ref-COD without mandatory references. We evaluate the proposed method on the large-scale R2C7K benchmark.

Most existing methods, based on real-valued modeling or local convolutional operations, are inadequate for capturing the underlying physics of coherent light propagation. Moreover, under low signal-to-noise conditions, these methods often converge to non-physical solutions, severely compromising the stability and reliability of the observation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel physics-driven Wavefront Propagating Compensation Network (WavePCNet) to simulate wavefront propagation and enhance the perception of obscured objects. This WavePCNet integrates the Tri-Phase Wavefront Complex-Propagation Reprojection (TriWCP) to incorporate complex amplitude transfer operators to precisely constrain coherent propagation behavior, along with a momentum memory mechanism to effectively suppress the accumulation of perturbations. Additionally, a High-frequency Cross-layer Compensation Enhancement is introduced to construct frequency-selective pathways with multi-scale receptive fields and dynamically model structural consistency across layers, further boosting the model's robustness and interpretability under complex environmental conditions.

This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning. We introduce GuardTrace-VL, a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors the full Question-Thinking-Answer (QTA) pipeline via joint image-text analysis, enabling detection of unsafe content as it emerges in the reasoning stage.

On our proposed test set covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, GuardTrace-VL model achieves an F1 score of 93.1% on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing a 13.5% improvement in F1 score compared to the previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods.

Model Transferability Estimation (MTE) methods address this by providing efficient proxy metrics to rank models without full fine-tuning. In practice, the choice of which MTE metric to use is often ad hoc or guided simply by a metric's average historical performance. However, we observe that the effectiveness of MTE metrics is highly task-dependent and no single metric is universally optimal across all target datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MetaRank, a meta-learning framework for automatic, task-aware MTE metric selection. We formulate metric selection as a learning-to-rank problem. Rather than relying on conventional meta-features, MetaRank encodes textual descriptions of both datasets and MTE metrics using a pretrained language model, embedding them into a shared semantic space. A meta-predictor is then trained offline on diverse meta-tasks to learn the intricate relationship between dataset characteristics and metric mechanisms, optimized with a listwise objective that prioritizes correctly ranking the top-performing metrics. During the subsequent online phase, MetaRank efficiently ranks the candidate MTE metrics for a new, unseen target dataset based on its textual description, enabling practitioners to select the most appropriate metric a priori.

Existing TMVC approaches predominantly rely on globally dense neighbor relationships to model intra-view dependencies, leading to high computational costs and an inability to directly ensure consistency across inter-view relationships. Furthermore, these methods typically aggregate evidence from different views through manually assigned weights, lacking guarantees that the learned multi-view neighbor structures are consistent within the class space, thus undermining the trustworthiness of classification outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TMVC framework that introduces prototypes to represent the neighbor structures of each view. By simplifying the learning of intra-view neighbor relations and enabling dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structure, our approach facilitates more efficient and consistent discovery of cross-view consensus. Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive downstream performance and robustness compared to prevalent TMVC methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u539f\u578b\u6765\u8868\u793a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u90bb\u5c45\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u89c6\u56fe\u5185\u90bb\u5c45\u5173\u7cfb\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u5171\u8bc6\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u4fe1\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u5c40\u5bc6\u96c6\u90bb\u5c45\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u89c6\u56fe\u5185\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u624b\u52a8\u5206\u914d\u6743\u91cd\u805a\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u56fe\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u90bb\u5c45\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u539f\u578b\u6765\u8868\u793a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u90bb\u5c45\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u89c6\u56fe\u5185\u90bb\u5c45\u5173\u7cfb\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u56fe\u5185\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u5171\u8bc6\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6d41\u53ef\u4fe1\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u578b\u8868\u793a\u90bb\u5c45\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fe1\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, achieving physically consistent image retouching with precise parameter control (e.g., exposure, white balance, zoom) remains challenging. Existing methods either rely solely on ambiguous and entangled text prompts, which hinders precise camera control, or train separate heads/weights for parameter adjustment, which compromises scalability, multi-parameter composition, and sensitivity to subtle variations. To address these limitations, we propose CameraMaster, a unified camera-aware framework for image retouching. The key idea is to explicitly decouple the camera directive and then coherently integrate two critical information streams: a directive representation that captures the photographer's intent, and a parameter embedding that encodes precise camera settings. CameraMaster first uses the camera parameter embedding to modulate both the camera directive and the content semantics. The modulated directive is then injected into the content features via cross-attention, yielding a strongly camera-sensitive semantic context. In addition, the directive and camera embeddings are injected as conditioning and gating signals into the time embedding, enabling unified, layer-wise modulation throughout the denoising process and enforcing tight semantic-parameter alignment. To train and evaluate CameraMaster, we construct a large-scale dataset of 78K image-prompt pairs annotated with camera parameters. Extensive experiments show that CameraMaster produces monotonic and near-linear responses to parameter variations, supports seamless multi-parameter composition, and significantly outperforms existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "CameraMaster\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u76f8\u673a\u6307\u4ee4\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\u8868\u793a\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u9970\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u65e0\u6cd5\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u76f8\u673a\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u72ec\u7684\u5934/\u6743\u91cd\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u7ec4\u5408\u56f0\u96be\u548c\u5bf9\u7ec6\u5fae\u53d8\u5316\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u5d4c\u5165\u8c03\u5236\u76f8\u673a\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c06\u8c03\u5236\u540e\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u6ce8\u5165\u5185\u5bb9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5c06\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u4e00\u5c42\u95f4\u8c03\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u572878K\u56fe\u50cf-\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCameraMaster\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u4ea7\u751f\u5355\u8c03\u4e14\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u7f1d\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CameraMaster\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u6574\u5408\u76f8\u673a\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u9970\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Yet current evaluation practices miss a fundamental question: Can captions stand-in for images in real downstream tasks? We propose a utility-based benchmark, CaptionQA, to evaluate model-generated captions, where caption quality is measured by how well it supports downstream tasks. CaptionQA is an extensible domain-dependent benchmark covering 4 domains--Natural, Document, E-commerce, and Embodied AI--each with fine-grained taxonomies (25 top-level and 69 subcategories) that identify useful information for domain-specific tasks. CaptionQA builds 33,027 densely annotated multiple-choice questions (50.3 per image on average) that explicitly require visual information to answer, providing a comprehensive probe of caption utility. In our evaluation protocol, an LLM answers these questions using captions alone, directly measuring whether captions preserve image-level utility and are utilizable by a downstream LLM. Evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals substantial gaps between the image and its caption utility. Notably, models nearly identical on traditional image-QA benchmarks lower by up to 32% in caption utility. We release CaptionQA along with an open-source pipeline for extension to new domains.

Despite promising progress, the limited generation efficiency of existing methods leaves insufficient computational headroom for high-fidelity 3D rendering, thereby constraining the expressiveness of 3D characters during real-world applications. Thus, we propose FlowerDance, which not only generates refined motion with physical plausibility and artistic expressiveness, but also achieves significant generation efficiency on inference speed and memory utilization . Specifically, FlowerDance combines MeanFlow with Physical Consistency Constraints, which enables high-quality motion generation with only a few sampling steps. Moreover, FlowerDance leverages a simple but efficient model architecture with BiMamba-based backbone and Channel-Level Cross-Modal Fusion, which generates dance with efficient non-autoregressive manner.

Although advancements have been made in using multimodal large language models for analyzing lung CT scans, challenges remain in accurately describing nodule morphology and incorporating medical expertise. These limitations affect the reliability and effectiveness of these models in clinical settings. Collaborative multi-agent systems offer a promising strategy for achieving a balance between generality and precision in medical applications, yet their potential in pathology has not been thoroughly explored. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LungNoduleAgent, an innovative collaborative multi-agent system specifically designed for analyzing lung CT scans. LungNoduleAgent streamlines the diagnostic process into sequential components, improving precision in describing nodules and grading malignancy through three primary modules. The first module, the Nodule Spotter, coordinates clinical detection models to accurately identify nodules. The second module, the Radiologist, integrates localized image description techniques to produce comprehensive CT reports. Finally, the Doctor Agent System performs malignancy reasoning by using images and CT reports, supported by a pathology knowledge base and a multi-agent system framework. Extensive testing on two private datasets and the public LIDC-IDRI dataset indicates that LungNoduleAgent surpasses mainstream vision-language models, agent systems, and advanced expert models. These results highlight the importance of region-level semantic alignment and multi-agent collaboration in diagnosing nodules. LungNoduleAgent stands out as a promising foundational tool for supporting clinical analyses of lung nodules.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LungNoduleAgent\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u80ba\u90e8CT\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ed3\u8282\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u6076\u6027\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5206\u7ea7\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u7ed3\u8282\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u878d\u5165\u533b\u5b66\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u534f\u4f5c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e73\u8861\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u7ed3\u8282\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5668\u534f\u8c03\u4e34\u5e8a\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u7ed3\u8282\uff1b\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u6574\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u6280\u672f\u751f\u6210\u5168\u9762CT\u62a5\u544a\uff1b\u533b\u751f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u548cCT\u62a5\u544a\u8fdb\u884c\u6076\u6027\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u75c5\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u516c\u5171LIDC-IDRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0cLungNoduleAgent\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4e3b\u6d41\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5148\u8fdb\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u8282\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cLungNoduleAgent\u662f\u652f\u6301\u80ba\u90e8\u7ed3\u8282\u4e34\u5e8a\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

State-of-the-art learning-based approaches generally fall into two paradigms: model-based deep unrolling methods that enforce physical constraints by modeling the degradations, but often produce over-smoothed, artifact-laden textures, and generative models that achieve superior perceptual quality yet hallucinate details due to weak physical constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that uniquely reconciles these paradigms by taming a powerful generative prior with explicit, dense physical constraints. Rather than oversimplifying the degradation field, we model it as a dense continuum of high-dimensional compressed kernels, ensuring that minute variations in motion and other degradation patterns are captured. We leverage this rich descriptor field to condition a ControlNet architecture, strongly guiding the diffusion sampling process.

Current Image Emotional Synthesis (IES) approaches artificially separate generation and editing tasks, creating inefficiencies and limiting applications where these tasks naturally intertwine, such as therapeutic interventions or storytelling. In this work, we introduce MUSE, the first unified framework capable of both emotional generation and editing. By adopting a strategy conceptually aligned with Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that widely used in both LLM and diffusion model communities, it avoids the requirement for additional updating diffusion model and specialized emotional synthesis datasets. More specifically, MUSE addresses three key questions in emotional synthesis: (1) HOW to stably guide synthesis by leveraging an off-the-shelf emotion classifier with gradient-based optimization of emotional tokens; (2) WHEN to introduce emotional guidance by identifying the optimal timing using semantic similarity as a supervisory signal; and (3) WHICH emotion to guide synthesis through a multi-emotion loss that reduces interference from inherent and similar emotions. Experimental results show that MUSE performs favorably against all methods for both generation and editing, improving emotional accuracy and semantic diversity while maintaining an optimal balance between desired content, adherence to text prompts, and realistic emotional expression.

Recent research has shown that long-term AD predictions by image generation often face difficulties maintaining disease-related characteristics when dealing with irregular time intervals in sequential data. Considering that the time-related aspects of the distribution can reflect changes in disease-related characteristics when images are distributed unevenly, this research proposes a model to estimate the temporal parameter within the Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution (T-NIG) to assist in generating images over the long term. The T-NIG model employs brain images from two different time points to create intermediate brain images, forecast future images, and predict the disease. T-NIG is designed by identifying features using coordinate neighborhoods. It incorporates a time parameter into the normal inverse gamma distribution to understand how features change in brain imaging sequences that have varying time intervals. Additionally, T-NIG utilizes uncertainty estimation to reduce both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in the model, which arise from insufficient temporal data. In particular, the T-NIG model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term prediction tasks within the dataset.

However, diffusion-based editing models often struggle to accurately interpret complex user instructions, especially those involving compositional relationships, contextual cues, or referring expressions, leading to edits that drift semantically or fail to reflect the intended changes. We tackle this problem by proposing MIRA (Multimodal Iterative Reasoning Agent), a lightweight, plug-and-play multimodal reasoning agent that performs editing through an iterative perception-reasoning-action loop, effectively simulating multi-turn human-model interaction processes. Instead of issuing a single prompt or static plan, MIRA predicts atomic edit instructions step by step, using visual feedback to make its decisions. Our 150K multimodal tool-use dataset, MIRA-Editing, combined with a two-stage SFT + GRPO training pipeline, enables MIRA to perform reasoning and editing over complex editing instructions.

However, their robustness is still challenged by variations in rotation, scale, specular reflections, and defocus blur. In addition, most existing approaches rely on straightforward point-to-point comparisons, typically using cosine or L2 distance, without effectively leveraging the spatio-spatial-temporal structure of iris patterns. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and generalized matching pipeline that learns rich spatio-spatial-temporal representations of iris features. Our approach first splits each iris image along one dimension, generating a sequence of sub-images that serve as input to a 3D-CNN, enabling the network to capture both spatial and spatio-spatial-temporal cues. To further enhance the modeling of spatio-spatial-temporal feature dynamics, we train the model in curriculum manner. This design allows the network to embed temporal dependencies directly into the feature space, improving discriminability in the deep metric domain. The framework is trained end-to-end with triplet and ArcFace loss in a curriculum manner, enforcing highly discriminative embeddings despite challenges like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur.

In this work, we present the Pygmalion Effect in Vision, a novel framework that metaphorically \"sculpts\" reflective objects into clay-like forms through image-to-clay translation. Inspired by the myth of Pygmalion, our method learns to suppress specular cues while preserving intrinsic geometric consistency, enabling robust reconstruction from multi-view images containing complex reflections. Specifically, we introduce a dual-branch network in which a BRDF-based reflective branch is complemented by a clay-guided branch that stabilizes geometry and refines surface normals. The two branches are trained jointly using the synthesized clay-like images, which provide a neutral, reflection-free supervision signal that complements the reflective views. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate substantial improvement in normal accuracy and mesh completeness over existing reflection-handling methods.

Although some priors introduce Knowledge Distillation to enhance student models, they overlook the fundamental differences in fine-grained vision comprehension caused by unbalanced vision tokens between the efficient student and vanilla teacher. In this paper, we propose EM-KD, a novel paradigm that enhances the Efficient MLLMs with Knowledge Distillation. To overcome the challenge of unbalanced vision tokens, we first calculate the Manhattan distance between the vision logits of teacher and student, and then align them in the spatial dimension with the Hungarian matching algorithm. After alignment, EM-KD introduces two distillation strategies: 1) Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) and 2) Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD). Specifically, VLAD calculates the affinity matrix between text tokens and aligned vision tokens, and minimizes the smooth L1 distance of the student and the teacher affinity matrices. Considering the semantic richness of vision logits in the final layer, VSD employs the reverse KL divergence to measure the discrete probability distributions of the aligned vision logits over the vocabulary space. Comprehensive evaluation on diverse benchmarks demonstrates that EM-KD trained model outperforms prior Efficient MLLMs on both accuracy and efficiency with a large margin, validating its effectiveness.

However, effective fusion of geometry-based 3DGS and appearance-driven diffusion models faces inherent challenges, as the absence of pixel-wise, 3D-consistent editing criteria often leads to over-restoration and geometric drift. To address these issues, we introduce \\textbf{FaithFusion}, a 3DGS-diffusion fusion framework driven by pixel-wise Expected Information Gain (EIG). EIG acts as a unified policy for coherent spatio-temporal synthesis: it guides diffusion as a spatial prior to refine high-uncertainty regions, while its pixel-level weighting distills the edits back into 3DGS. The resulting plug-and-play system is free from extra prior conditions and structural modifications.Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our approach attains SOTA performance across NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID, maintaining an FID of 107.47 even at 6 meters lane shift.

As the disease progresses, patients typically undergo brain atrophy. Current prediction methods for Alzheimers disease largely involve analyzing morphological changes in brain images through manual feature extraction. This paper proposes a novel method, the Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN), to automate the learning of morphological changes in brain images about disease progression for early prediction. Given the common occurrence of missing data in the temporal sequences of MRI images, DATGN initially interpolates incomplete sequences. Subsequently, a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module guides the network in generating future MRI images that adhere to the disease's progression, facilitating early prediction of Alzheimer's disease. DATGN was tested for the generation of temporal sequences of future MRI images using the ADNI dataset, and the experimental results are competitive in terms of PSNR and MMSE image quality metrics. Furthermore, when DATGN-generated synthetic data was integrated into the SVM vs. CNN vs. 3DCNN-based classification methods, significant improvements were achieved from 6. 21\\% to 16\\% in AD vs. NC classification accuracy and from 7. 34\\% to 21. 25\\% in AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification accuracy.

However, transferring these pre-trained models to downstream tasks often results in significant parameter redundancy. In this paper, we propose EntPruner, an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models. First, we introduce entropy-guided pruning, a block-level importance assessment strategy specifically designed for generative models. Unlike discriminative models, generative models require preserving the diversity and condition-fidelity of the output distribution. As the importance of each module can vary significantly across downstream tasks, EntPruner prioritizes pruning of less important blocks using data-dependent Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) as a guiding metric. CED quantifies how much the distribution diverges from the learned conditional data distribution after removing a block. Second, we propose a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework to automatically determine when and how much to prune during training. This dynamic strategy avoids the pitfalls of one-shot pruning, mitigating mode collapse, and preserving model performance.

Project page: https://tele-ai.github.io/CtrlVDiff/", "summary": "We tackle the dual challenges of video understanding and controllable video generation within a unified diffusion framework. Our key insights are two-fold: geometry-only cues (e.g., depth, edges) are insufficient: they specify layout but under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, limiting physically meaningful edits such as relighting or material swaps and often causing temporal drift. Enriching the model with additional graphics-based modalities (intrinsics and semantics) provides complementary constraints that both disambiguate understanding and enable precise, predictable control during generation.\n  However, building a single model that uses many heterogeneous cues introduces two core difficulties. Architecturally, the model must accept any subset of modalities, remain robust to missing inputs, and inject control signals without sacrificing temporal consistency. Data-wise, training demands large-scale, temporally aligned supervision that ties real videos to per-pixel multimodal annotations.\n  We then propose CtrlVDiff, a unified diffusion model trained with a Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from depth, normals, segmentation, edges, and graphics-based intrinsics (albedo, roughness, metallic), and re-renders videos from any chosen subset with strong temporal coherence. To enable this, we build MMVideo, a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset aligned across modalities and captions. Across understanding and generation benchmarks, CtrlVDiff delivers superior controllability and fidelity, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) and surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while remaining robust when some modalities are unavailable.", "AI": {"tldr": "CtrlVDiff\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u6cd5\u7ebf\u3001\u5206\u5272\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u5f62\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5c42\u72b6\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u5f3a\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u7ea6\u675f\u5916\u89c2\u3001\u6750\u8d28\u548c\u5149\u7167\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\uff08\u5982\u91cd\u65b0\u7167\u660e\u6216\u6750\u8d28\u4ea4\u6362\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ecf\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u65f6\u95f4\u6f02\u79fb\u3002\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u5f62\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e92\u8865\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u7406\u89e3\u6b67\u4e49\u5e76\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u53ef\u63a7\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCtrlVDiff\u7edf\u4e00\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff08HMCS\uff09\u6765\u8def\u7531\u548c\u878d\u5408\u6765\u81ea\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u6cd5\u7ebf\u3001\u5206\u5272\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u548c\u56fe\u5f62\u5185\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u53cd\u7167\u7387\u3001\u7c97\u7cd9\u5ea6\u3001\u91d1\u5c5e\u6027\uff09\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86MMVideo\u6df7\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCtrlVDiff\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c42\u72b6\u7f16\u8f91\uff08\u91cd\u65b0\u7167\u660e\u3001\u6750\u8d28\u8c03\u6574\u3001\u5bf9\u8c61\u63d2\u5165\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u5f62\u6a21\u6001\uff0cCtrlVDiff\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u5f3a\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Blurring is naturally caused by the convolution of the sharp image with the blur kernel. Thus, allowing the network to learn the blur process in the kernel-level can significantly improve the image deblurring performance. But, current deep networks are still at the pixel-level learning stage, either performing end-to-end pixel-level restoration or stage-wise pseudo kernel-level restoration, failing to enable the deblur model to understand the essence of the blur. To this end, we propose Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE), which considers the activation operation in Fourier space and converts the convolution problem in the spatial domain to a multiplication problem in Fourier space. Our FKE, jointly optimized with the deblur model, enables the network to learn the kernel-level blur process with low complexity and without any additional supervision. Furthermore, we change the convolution object of the kernel from ``image\" to network extracted ``feature\", whose rich semantic and structural information is more suitable to blur process learning. With the convolution of the feature and the estimated kernel, our model can learn the essence of blur in kernel-level. To further improve the efficiency of feature extraction, we design a decoupled multi-scale architecture with multiple hierarchical sub-unets with a reversible strategy, which allows better multi-scale encoding and decoding in low training memory. Extensive experiments indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art motion deblurring results and show potential for handling other kernel-related problems. Analysis also shows our kernel estimator is able to learn physically meaningful kernels.

The main concept involves learning an accurate alignment of visual elements and language expressions within a semantic space. Recent approaches address cross-modality alignment through conditional queries, tracking the target object using a query-response based mechanism built upon transformer structure. However, they exhibit two limitations: (1) these conditional queries lack inter-frame dependency and variation modeling, making accurate target tracking challenging amid significant frame-to-frame variations; and (2) they integrate textual constraints belatedly, which may cause the video features potentially focus on the non-referred objects. Therefore, we propose a novel RVOS architecture called ProxyFormer, which introduces a set of proxy queries to integrate visual and text semantics and facilitate the flow of semantics between them. By progressively updating and propagating proxy queries across multiple stages of video feature encoder, ProxyFormer ensures that the video features are focused on the object of interest. This dynamic evolution also enables the establishment of inter-frame dependencies, enhancing the accuracy and coherence of object tracking.

To address this, we propose a TEmporal-aware Automated Red-teaming framework, named TEAR, an automated framework designed to uncover safety risks specifically linked to the dynamic temporal sequencing of T2V models. TEAR employs a temporal-aware test generator optimized via a two-stage approach: initial generator training and temporal-aware online preference learning, to craft textually innocuous prompts that exploit temporal dynamics to elicit policy-violating video output.

Many recent MLLMs increasingly favor global native- resolution visual encoding over slice-based methods. To investigate this trend, we systematically compare their behavior on vision-language understanding and attention patterns, revealing that global encoding enhances overall capability but at the expense of greater computational overhead. To address this issue, we present LLaVA-UHD v3, an MLLM centered upon our proposed Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) method, which can be seamlessly integrated into standard Vision Transformer (ViT) to enable efficient native-resolution encoding. The PVC approach consists of two key modules: (i) refined patch embedding, which supports flexible patch-size scaling for fine-grained visual model- ing, (ii) windowed token compression, hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations. Jointly modulated by these two modules, a widely pretrained ViT can be reconfigured into an efficient architecture while largely preserving generality. Evaluated across extensive benchmarks, the transformed ViT, termed ViT-UHD, demonstrates competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT (time-to-first-token) by 2.4x, when developed within an identical MLLM architecture. Building upon ViT-UHD, LLaVA-UHD v3 also achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL, while further reducing TTFT by 1.9x.

While test-time computation scaling has brought remarkable success in enabling reasoning-enhanced outputs for challenging natural language tasks, its adaptation to visual AR models remains unexplored and poses unique challenges. Naively applying test-time scaling strategies such as Best-of-N can be suboptimal: they consume full-length computation on erroneous generation trajectories, while the raster-scan decoding scheme lacks a blueprint of the entire canvas, limiting scaling benefits as only a few prompt-aligned candidates are generated. To address these, we introduce GridAR, a test-time scaling framework designed to elicit the best possible results from visual AR models. GridAR employs a grid-partitioned progressive generation scheme in which multiple partial candidates for the same position are generated within a canvas, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones are fixed as anchors to guide subsequent decoding. Coupled with this, we present a layout-specified prompt reformulation strategy that inspects partial views to infer a feasible layout for satisfying the prompt.

This guidance improves CLIP generalizations. However, these anchors-static in both value and position-lack cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility. To address this limitation, we propose AnchorOPT, a dynamic anchor-based prompt learning framework. Specifically, AnchorOPT introduces dynamism in two key dimensions: (i) anchor values eschew handcrafted explicit textual tokens (e.g., \"shape\", \"color\"), instead learning dynamically from task-specific data; and (ii) the positional relationship between anchor and soft tokens is no longer fixed but adaptively optimized via a learnable position matrix conditioned on the training stage and task context. Training occurs in two stages: we first learn the anchor tokens, then freeze and transfer them to the second stage for optimization of soft tokens and the position matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using only a simple learnable anchor and position matrix achieves performance comparable to or exceeding some methods incorporating additional learnable modules or regularization techniques. As a plug-and-play module, AnchorOPT integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks, yielding consistent performance gains across diverse datasets.

However, effectively tokenizing 3D scenes into holistic scene tokens, and leveraging these tokens across diverse 3D understanding tasks, remain highly challenging. We present NDTokenizer3D, a generalist 3D VLM that performs a wide range of 3D scene understanding tasks while naturally supporting human interactions, thereby bridging language-level reasoning with 3D spatial understanding. The core of our approach is a novel three-stage scene tokenization pipeline built upon a Multi-Scale Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) representation, paired with a Multi-Scale NDT Decoder (MSDec). Specifically, NDTokenizer3D first constructs a multi-scale NDT representation from raw high-resolution point clouds, preserving both global context and fine-grained geometric details. Next, the MSDec progressively fuses cross-scale NDT features, producing holistic scene tokens consumable by LLM endpoints. Beyond tokenization, MSDec is repurposed as a general interface for human-interactive prompting (points, boxes, masks) and segmentation-mask decoding, unifying diverse 3D scene understanding tasks within a single architecture. With this compact and unified design, NDTokenizer3D offers a fine-grained, general-purpose 3D VLM, achieving remarkable improvements in 3D Referring Segmentation, 3D Visual Question Answering, and 3D Dense Captioning.", "AI": {"tldr": "NDTokenizer3D\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u76843D\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6NDT\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u573a\u666f\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd3D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u57283D\u53c2\u8003\u5206\u5272\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d3D\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6807\u8bb03D\u573a\u666f\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6807\u8bb0\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u53163D\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e3D\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u6362(NDT)\u8868\u793a\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u573a\u666f\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6NDT\u8868\u793a\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6NDT\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u878d\u5408\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u91cd\u65b0\u7528\u4f5c\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u901a\u7528\u63a5\u53e3\u3002", "result": "\u57283D\u53c2\u8003\u5206\u5272\u30013D\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u548c3D\u5bc6\u96c6\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u901a\u75283D\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "NDTokenizer3D\u901a\u8fc7\u7d27\u51d1\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u53163D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u901a\u75283D\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8fde\u63a5\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e3D\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we present a systematic study of universal, transferable adversarial patches against VLA-driven robots under unknown architectures, finetuned variants, and sim-to-real shifts. We introduce UPA-RFAS (Universal Patch Attack via Robust Feature, Attention, and Semantics), a unified framework that learns a single physical patch in a shared feature space while promoting cross-model transfer. UPA-RFAS combines (i) a feature-space objective with an $\\ell_1$ deviation prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss to induce transferable representation shifts, (ii) a robustness-augmented two-phase min-max procedure where an inner loop learns invisible sample-wise perturbations and an outer loop optimizes the universal patch against this hardened neighborhood, and (iii) two VLA-specific losses: Patch Attention Dominance to hijack text$\\to$vision attention and Patch Semantic Misalignment to induce image-text mismatch without labels. Experiments across diverse VLA models, manipulation suites, and physical executions show that UPA-RFAS consistently transfers across models, tasks, and viewpoints, exposing a practical patch-based attack surface and establishing a strong baseline for future defenses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faUPA-RFAS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9c81\u68d2\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u7528\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u672a\u77e5\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u53d8\u4f53\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5747\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6297\u8865\u4e01\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u653b\u51fb\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5min-max\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u4ee5\u53caVLA\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u52ab\u6301\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u9519\u914d\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5355\u4e00\u7269\u7406\u8865\u4e01\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eUPA-RFAS\u5728\u4e0d\u540cVLA\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u5747\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8865\u4e01\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u653b\u51fb\u9762\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3aVLA\u6a21\u578b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8865\u4e01\u653b\u51fb\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u9632\u5fa1\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, a common issue with existing methods is the disparity between global and local feature structures. While local structures typically show strong consistency and compactness within class samples, global features often present intertwined boundaries and poorly separated clusters. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCBoost, a parameter-free plug-in designed to enhance the global feature structures of current deep clustering models. By harnessing reliable local structural cues, our method aims to elevate clustering performance effectively. Specifically, we first identify high-confidence samples through adaptive $k$-nearest neighbors-based consistency filtering, aiming to select a sufficient number of samples with high label reliability to serve as trustworthy anchors for self-supervision. Subsequently, these samples are utilized to compute a discriminative loss, which promotes both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, to guide network optimization. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets showcase that our DCBoost significantly improves the clustering performance of diverse existing deep clustering models. Notably, our method improves the performance of current state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., ProPos) by more than 3% and amplifies the silhouette coefficient by over $7\\times$.

In this paper, we address the challenge of adapting a pre-trained foundation model to inject domain-specific knowledge, without retraining from scratch or incurring significant computational costs. To this end, we introduce BotaCLIP, a lightweight multimodal contrastive framework that adapts a pre-trained Earth Observation foundation model (DOFA) by aligning high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relev\u00e9s. Unlike generic embeddings, BotaCLIP internalizes ecological structure through contrastive learning with a regularization strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Once trained, the resulting embeddings serve as transferable representations for downstream predictors. Motivated by real-world applications in biodiversity modeling, we evaluated BotaCLIP representations in three ecological tasks: plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation.

In this work, we introduce the Action-Region Tracking (ART) framework, a novel solution leveraging a query-response mechanism to discover and track the dynamics of distinctive local details, enabling effective distinction of similar actions. Specifically, we propose a region-specific semantic activation module that employs discriminative and text-constrained semantics as queries to capture the most action-related region responses in each video frame, facilitating interaction among spatial and temporal dimensions with corresponding video features. The captured region responses are organized into action tracklets, which characterize region-based action dynamics by linking related responses across video frames in a coherent sequence. The text-constrained queries encode nuanced semantic representations derived from textual descriptions of action labels extracted by language branches within Visual Language Models (VLMs). To optimize the action tracklets, we design a multi-level tracklet contrastive constraint among region responses at spatial and temporal levels, enabling effective discrimination within each frame and correlation between adjacent frames.

We further extend CFM to image inpainting, implementing mask-guided sampling with four mask types (center, random bbox, irregular, half). Our fine-tuned inpainting model achieves substantial improvements: PSNR increases from 4.95 to 8.57 dB on center masks (+73%), and SSIM improves from 0.289 to 0.418 (+45%), demonstrating the effectiveness of inpainting-aware training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff1aDDPM\u3001CFM\u548cMeanFlow\u3002CFM\u572850\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u65f6FID\u4e3a24.15\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eDDPM\u7684402.98\u3002MeanFlow\u5355\u6b65\u91c7\u6837FID\u4e3a29.15\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1150\u500d\u3002CFM\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u5728\u4e2d\u5fc3\u63a9\u7801\u4e0aPSNR\u4ece4.95\u63d0\u5347\u52308.57dB\uff0cSSIM\u4ece0.289\u63d0\u5347\u52300.418\u3002", "motivation": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5173\u6ce8\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22CFM\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684TinyUNet\u67b6\u6784\uff08<150\u4e07\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u5728CIFAR-10\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0DDPM\u3001CFM\u548cMeanFlow\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002CFM\u91c7\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff0cDDPM\u4f7f\u7528\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff0cMeanFlow\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\u5185\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u901f\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "CFM\u572850\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u65f6FID\u4e3a24.15\uff0cDDPM\u4e3a402.98\uff0cMeanFlow\u5355\u6b65\u91c7\u6837FID\u4e3a29.15\u3002CFM\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u4e2d\u5fc3\u63a9\u7801\u4e0aPSNR\u63d0\u534773%\uff084.95\u21928.57dB\uff09\uff0cSSIM\u63d0\u534745%\uff080.289\u21920.418\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "CFM\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eDDPM\uff0cMeanFlow\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5355\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u3002CFM\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4fee\u590d\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4fee\u590d\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Attackers selectively modify partial but semantically critical frames while preserving the overall perceptual authenticity, making such forgeries particularly difficult to detect. Existing methods focus on independently detecting whether a single frame is forged, lacking the hierarchical structure to capture both transient and sustained anomalies across different temporal levels. To address these limitations, We identify three key levels relevant to partial audio forgery detection and present T3-Tracer, the first framework that jointly analyzes audio at the frame, segment, and audio levels to comprehensively detect forgery traces. T3-Tracer consists of two complementary core modules: the Frame-Audio Feature Aggregation Module (FA-FAM) and the Segment-level Multi-Scale Discrepancy-Aware Module (SMDAM). FA-FAM is designed to detect the authenticity of each audio frame. It combines both frame-level and audio-level temporal information to detect intra-frame forgery cues and global semantic inconsistencies. To further refine and correct frame detection, we introduce SMDAM to detect forgery boundaries at the segment level. It adopts a dual-branch architecture that jointly models frame features and inter-frame differences across multi-scale temporal windows, effectively identifying abrupt anomalies that appeared on the forged boundaries.

However, its geometric inaccuracies and biased depth rendering currently prevent robust correspondence labeling. To address this, we introduce MatchGS, the first framework designed to systematically correct and leverage 3DGS for robust, zero-shot image matching. Our approach is twofold: (1) a geometrically-faithful data generation pipeline that refines 3DGS geometry to produce highly precise correspondence labels, enabling the synthesis of a vast and diverse range of viewpoints without compromising rendering fidelity; and (2) a 2D-3D representation alignment strategy that infuses 3DGS' explicit 3D knowledge into the 2D matcher, guiding 2D semi-dense matchers to learn viewpoint-invariant 3D representations. Our generated ground-truth correspondences reduce the epipolar error by up to 40 times compared to existing datasets, enable supervision under extreme viewpoint changes, and provide self-supervisory signals through Gaussian attributes. Consequently, state-of-the-art matchers trained solely on our data achieve significant zero-shot performance gains on public benchmarks, with improvements of up to 17.7%.

Compared to single-task approaches, MTL methods offer improved generalization, enhanced scalability, and greater practical applicability. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have achieved promising results in RS image understanding, grounding, and ultra-high-resolution (UHR) image reasoning, respectively. Moreover, the unified text-based interface demonstrates significant potential for MTL. Hence, in this work, we present RSCoVLM, a simple yet flexible VLM baseline for RS MTL. Firstly, we create the data curation engine, including data acquisition, offline processing and integrating, as well as online loading and weighting. This data engine effectively addresses complex RS data enviroment and generates flexible vision-language conversations. Furthermore, we propose a unified dynamic-resolution strategy to address the diverse image scales inherent in RS imagery. For UHR images, we introduce the Zoom-in Chain mechanism together with its corresponding dataset, LRS-VQA-Zoom. The strategies are flexible and effectively mitigate the computational burdens. Additionally, we significantly enhance the model's object detection capability and propose a novel evaluation protocol that ensures fair comparison between VLMs and conventional detection models.

In contrast, emerging State Space Models like Mamba offer linear-time efficiency and are inherently suited to modeling long, continuous structures.

To address this, we introduce CaliTex, a framework of geometry-calibrated attention that explicitly aligns attention with 3D structure. It introduces two modules: Part-Aligned Attention that enforces spatial alignment across semantically matched parts, and Condition-Routed Attention which routes appearance information through geometry-conditioned pathways to maintain spatial fidelity.

However, this joint inference mechanism requires global attention layers that perform all-to-all attention computation on tokens from all views. For reconstruction of large scenes with long-sequence inputs, this causes a significant latency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose head-wise temporal merging (HTTM), a training-free 3D token merging method for accelerating VGGT. Existing merging techniques merge tokens uniformly across different attention heads, resulting in identical tokens in the layers' output, which hinders the model's representational ability. HTTM tackles this problem by merging tokens in multi-head granularity, which preserves the uniqueness of feature tokens after head concatenation. Additionally, this enables HTTM to leverage the spatial locality and temporal correspondence observed at the head level to achieve higher merging ratios with lower merging costs compared to existing methods.

Prevailing approaches predominantly operate in pairwise settings, aligning two modalities at a time. While some recent methods aim to capture higher-order interactions among multiple modalities, they often overlook or insufficiently preserve pairwise relationships, limiting their effectiveness on single-modality tasks. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Fusion (ConFu), a framework that jointly embeds both individual modalities and their fused combinations into a unified representation space, where modalities and their fused counterparts are aligned. ConFu extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with an additional fused-modality contrastive term, encouraging the joint embedding of modality pairs with a third modality. This formulation enables ConFu to capture higher-order dependencies, such as XOR-like relationships, that cannot be recovered through pairwise alignment alone, while still maintaining strong pairwise correspondence. We evaluate ConFu on synthetic and real-world multimodal benchmarks, assessing its ability to exploit cross-modal complementarity, capture higher-order dependencies, and scale with increasing multimodal complexity. Across these settings, ConFu demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval and classification tasks, while supporting unified one-to-one and two-to-one retrieval within a single contrastive framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "ConFu\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8054\u5408\u5d4c\u5165\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\u53ca\u5176\u878d\u5408\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6210\u5bf9\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u9ad8\u9636\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5904\u7406\u6210\u5bf9\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u9ad8\u9636\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u5728\u6355\u6349\u9ad8\u9636\u5173\u7cfb\u65f6\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u4fdd\u6301\u6210\u5bf9\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "ConFu\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9879\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u4e0e\u7b2c\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6355\u6349\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6210\u5bf9\u5bf9\u9f50\u6062\u590d\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cConFu\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u3001\u6355\u6349\u9ad8\u9636\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u548c\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "ConFu\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u9ad8\u9636\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u6210\u5bf9\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

The proposed approach integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for spatial feature encoding with a latency-driven spike conversion layer and a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for classification. The Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset is recorded under various weather and lighting conditions, comprising 6,000 labelled frames that include both real and synthetically augmented unsafe cases. The presented system achieves a classification accuracy of 92.3% (+- 0.8%) with a per-frame inference time of 9.5 ms. Achieved sub-10 millisecond latency, combined with sparse spike activity (8.1%), enables real-time, low-power edge deployment. Unlike conventional CNN-based approaches, the hybrid SIFT-SNN pipeline explicitly preserves spatial feature grounding, enhances interpretability, supports transparent decision-making, and operates efficiently on embedded hardware. Although synthetic augmentation improved robustness, generalisation to unseen field conditions remains to be validated. The SIFT-SNN framework is validated through a working prototype deployed on a consumer-grade system and framed as a generalisable case study in structural safety monitoring for movable concrete barriers, which, as a traffic flow-control infrastructure, is deployed in over 20 cities worldwide.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSIFT-SNN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SIFT\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ea4\u901a\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7ed3\u6784\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe92.3%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f49.5ms\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7684\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u9ad8\u529f\u8017\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\u53d8\u6362(SIFT)\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u8f6c\u6362\u5c42\u548c\u6cc4\u6f0f\u79ef\u5206\u70b9\u706b(LIF)\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5965\u514b\u5170\u6d77\u6e2f\u5927\u6865\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523092.3%\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6bcf\u5e27\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f49.5ms\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u8109\u51b2\u6d3b\u52a8\u7387\u4e3a8.1%\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "SIFT-SNN\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u62a4\u680f\u7b49\u4ea4\u901a\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing methods commonly employ various parameter-heavy strategies to extract a full feature description from the input patch. However, they still have difficulties in accurately and efficiently predicting normals for various point clouds. In this work, we present a new idea of feature extraction for robust normal estimation of point clouds. We use the fusion of multi-scale features from different neighborhood sizes to address the issue of selecting reasonable patch sizes for various data or geometries. We seek to model a patch feature fitting (PFF) based on multi-scale features to approximate the optimal geometric description for normal estimation and implement the approximation process via multi-scale feature aggregation and cross-scale feature compensation. The feature aggregation module progressively aggregates the patch features of different scales to the center of the patch and shrinks the patch size by removing points far from the center. It not only enables the network to precisely capture the structure characteristic in a wide range, but also describes highly detailed geometries. The feature compensation module ensures the reusability of features from earlier layers of large scales and reveals associated information in different patch sizes. Our approximation strategy based on aggregating the features of multiple scales enables the model to achieve scale adaptation of varying local patches and deliver the optimal feature description.

Pure photometric supervision misaligns with geometry and triggers early geometric drift, where erroneous shapes are reinforced during densification and become hard to correct. We ask how to anchor geometry early for 4D Gaussian splatting (4DGS) while maintaining temporal consistency and efficiency in dynamic endoscopic scenes. Thus, we present Endo-G$^{2}$T, a geometry-guided and temporally aware training scheme for time-embedded 4DGS. First, geo-guided prior distillation converts confidence-gated monocular depth into supervision with scale-invariant depth and depth-gradient losses, using a warm-up-to-cap schedule to inject priors softly and avoid early overfitting. Second, a time-embedded Gaussian field represents dynamics in XYZT with a rotor-like rotation parameterization, yielding temporally coherent geometry with lightweight regularization that favors smooth motion and crisp opacity boundaries.

However, existing methods fall short of human-like abstract visual thinking, as their flexibility is fundamentally limited by external tools. In this work, we introduce Monet, a training framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason directly within the latent visual space by generating continuous embeddings that function as intermediate visual thoughts. We identify two core challenges in training MLLMs for latent visual reasoning: high computational cost in latent-vision alignment and insufficient supervision over latent embeddings, and address them with a three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. We further reveal a limitation of applying GRPO to latent reasoning: it primarily enhances text-based reasoning rather than latent reasoning. To overcome this, we propose VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that explicitly incorporates latent embeddings into policy gradient updates. To support SFT, we construct Monet-SFT-125K, a high-quality text-image interleaved CoT dataset containing 125K real-world, chart, OCR, and geometry CoTs. Our model, Monet-7B, shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks and exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization on challenging abstract visual reasoning tasks.

Prior studies on language models have reported an inverse scaling effect, where textual distractors lead to longer but less effective reasoning. To investigate whether similar phenomena occur in multimodal settings, we introduce Idis (Images with distractors), a visual question-answering dataset that systematically varies distractors along semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Our analyses reveal that visual distractors differ fundamentally from textual ones: although inverse scaling persists, adding visual distractors reduces accuracy without increasing reasoning length. We further show that tracking attribute counts within reasoning traces provides key insights into how distractors, reasoning length, and accuracy interact. Finally, we demonstrate that these trends extend to established visual bias benchmarks such as Waterbirds, and we propose a simple prompting strategy to mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u65e0\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5e72\u6270\u9879\uff09\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u867d\u7136\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\u9006\u6269\u5c55\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u800c\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6587\u672c\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u9006\u6269\u5c55\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5373\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86Idis\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u6570\u503c\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u53d8\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u9879\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u8ba1\u6570\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4f46\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d8b\u52bf\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5df2\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u504f\u89c1\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u51cf\u8f7b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u9a71\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

While VAR models have recently emerged as strong competitors to diffusion and flow models for image generation, they suffer from a critical limitation in diversity, often producing nearly identical images even for simple prompts. This issue has largely gone unnoticed amid the predominant focus on image quality. We address this limitation at test time in two stages. First, inspired by diversity enhancement techniques in diffusion models, we propose injecting noise into the text embedding. This introduces a trade-off between diversity and image quality: as diversity increases, the image quality sharply declines. To preserve quality, we propose scale-travel: a novel latent refinement technique inspired by time-travel strategies in diffusion models. Specifically, we use a multi-scale autoencoder to extract coarse-scale tokens that enable us to resume generation at intermediate stages. Extensive experiments show that combining text-embedding noise injection with our scale-travel refinement significantly enhances diversity while minimizing image-quality degradation, achieving a new Pareto frontier in the diversity-quality trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "DiverseVAR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65c5\u884c\u7cbe\u70bc\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "VAR\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u867d\u7136\u8d28\u91cf\u4f18\u79c0\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5bf9\u7b80\u5355\u63d0\u793a\u4e5f\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u51e0\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002", "method": "1. \u5728\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65c5\u884c\u7cbe\u70bc\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u7c97\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4ece\u4e2d\u95f4\u9636\u6bb5\u6062\u590d\u751f\u6210\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65c5\u884c\u7cbe\u70bc\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027-\u8d28\u91cf\u6743\u8861\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u3002", "conclusion": "DiverseVAR\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VAR\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Existing methods typically employ CNNs/Transformers to extract visual representations from the given images or incorporate auxiliary tasks to enhance the final results, with weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge into the captioning framework. Specifically, we employ a CNN/Transformer model to extract global-level vision features, leverage the SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, and utilize a specially constructed knowledge graph to provide information about objects of interest. These heterogeneous sources of information are then fused via cross-attention, and a Transformer decoder is used to generate the final natural language description of the observed changes.

While learning approaches have shown promising results, most still rely primarily on geometric features to assemble a whole from its parts. As a result, methods struggle when geometry alone is insufficient or ambiguous, for example, for small, eroded, or symmetric fragments. Additionally, solutions do not impose physical constraints that explicitly prevent overlapping assemblies. To address these limitations, we introduce E-M3RF, an equivariant multimodal 3D reassembly framework that takes as input the point clouds, containing both point positions and colors of fractured fragments, and predicts the transformations required to reassemble them using SE(3) flow matching. Each fragment is represented by both geometric and color features: i) 3D point positions are encoded as rotationconsistent geometric features using a rotation-equivariant encoder, ii) the colors at each 3D point are encoded with a transformer. The two feature sets are then combined to form a multimodal representation. We experimented on four datasets: two synthetic datasets, Breaking Bad and Fantastic Breaks, and two real-world cultural heritage datasets, RePAIR and Presious, demonstrating that E-M3RF on the RePAIR dataset reduces rotation error by 23.1% and translation error by 13.2%, while Chamfer Distance decreases by 18.4% compared to competing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "E-M3RF\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b49\u53d8\u591a\u6a21\u60013D\u91cd\u7ec4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u989c\u8272\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528SE(3)\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u788e\u7247\u91cd\u7ec4\u6240\u9700\u7684\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u8db3\u6216\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u76843D\u91cd\u7ec4\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\uff08\u5982\u5c0f\u788e\u7247\u3001\u4fb5\u8680\u788e\u7247\u6216\u5bf9\u79f0\u788e\u7247\uff09\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9632\u6b62\u91cd\u53e0\u7ec4\u88c5\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u53d8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff0cTransformer\u63d0\u53d6\u989c\u8272\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SE(3)\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u9884\u6d4b\u788e\u7247\u53d8\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u5728RePAIR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u7ade\u4e89\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee\u51cf\u5c1123.1%\uff0c\u5e73\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u51cf\u5c1113.2%\uff0cChamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u51cf\u5c1118.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "E-M3RF\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u989c\u8272\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u788e\u7247\u91cd\u7ec4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a novel hypergraph-guided spatio-temporal event stream completion mechanism, which connects event tokens across different times and spatial locations via hypergraphs and leverages contextual information message passing to complete these sparse events. The proposed method can flexibly incorporate RGB tokens as nodes in the hypergraph within this completion framework, enabling multi-modal hypergraph-based information completion. Subsequently, we aggregate hypergraph node information across different time steps through self-attention, enabling effective learning and fusion of multi-modal features.

However, the substantial computational complexity and slow generation speed of diffusion models pose significant challenges for real-time, high-resolution video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices. In this work, we propose MobileI2V, a 270M lightweight diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation on mobile devices. The core lies in: (1) We analyzed the performance of linear attention modules and softmax attention modules on mobile devices, and proposed a linear hybrid architecture denoiser that balances generation efficiency and quality. (2) We design a time-step distillation strategy that compresses the I2V sampling steps from more than 20 to only two without significant quality loss, resulting in a 10-fold increase in generation speed. (3) We apply mobile-specific attention optimizations that yield a 2-fold speed-up for attention operations during on-device inference. MobileI2V enables, for the first time, fast 720p image-to-video generation on mobile devices, with quality comparable to existing models. Under one-step conditions, the generation speed of each frame of 720p video is less than 100 ms.

Our algorithm involves two types of weight merging: inter-task weight merging and intra-task weight merging. Inter-task weight merging unifies previous models by averaging the weights of models from all previous stages. On the other hand, intra-task weight merging facilitates the learning of current task by combining the model parameters within current stage.

Unlike traditional self-attention-based distillation methods that align teacher and student feature maps independently, CanKD enables each pixel in the student feature map to dynamically consider all pixels in the teacher feature map. This non-local knowledge transfer more thoroughly captures pixel-wise relationships, improving feature representation learning. Our method introduces only an additional loss function to achieve superior performance compared with existing attention-guided distillation methods. Extensive experiments on object detection and image segmentation tasks demonstrate that CanKD outperforms state-of-the-art feature and hybrid distillation methods.

Despite its importance, manual ANA detection is slow, labor-intensive, and demands years of training. ANA detection is complicated by over 100 coexisting antibody types, resulting in vast fluorescent pattern combinations. Although machine learning and deep learning have enabled automation, ANA detection in real-world clinical settings presents unique challenges as it involves multi-instance, multi-label (MIML) learning. In this paper, a novel framework for ANA detection is proposed that handles the complexities of MIML tasks using unaltered microscope images without manual preprocessing. Inspired by human labeling logic, it identifies consistent ANA sub-regions and assigns aggregated labels accordingly. These steps are implemented using three task-specific components: an instance sampler, a probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher, and self-paced weight learning rate coefficients. The instance sampler suppresses low-confidence instances by modeling pattern confidence, while the dispatcher adaptively assigns labels based on instance distinguishability. Self-paced learning adjusts training according to empirical label observations. Our framework overcomes limitations of traditional MIML methods and supports end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on one ANA dataset and three public medical MIML benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework. On the ANA dataset, our model achieves up to +7.0% F1-Macro and +12.6% mAP gains over the best prior method, setting new state-of-the-art results.

The application of generated images for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease poses challenges, particularly in accurately representing the disease's characteristics when input sequences are captured at irregular time intervals. This study presents an innovative methodology for sequential image generation, guided by quantitative metrics, to maintain the essential features indicative of disease progression. Furthermore, an age-scaling factor is integrated into the process to produce age-specific MRI images, facilitating the prediction of advanced stages of the disease. The results obtained from the ablation study suggest that the inclusion of quantitative metrics significantly improves the accuracy of MRI image synthesis.

However, its extension to video generation faces significant challenges. Existing video reward models rely on vision-language models designed for pixel-space inputs, confining ReFL optimization to near-complete denoising steps after computationally expensive VAE decoding. This pixel-space approach incurs substantial memory overhead and increased training time, and its late-stage optimization lacks early-stage supervision, refining only visual quality rather than fundamental motion dynamics and structural coherence. In this work, we show that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process noisy latent representations at arbitrary timesteps and inherently preserve temporal information through their sequential modeling capabilities. Accordingly, we propose Process Reward Feedback Learning~(PRFL), a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences, while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PRFL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2dReward\u53cd\u9988\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4ReFL\u4f18\u5316\u53ea\u80fd\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u540e\u671f\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65e9\u671f\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4e14\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u63d0\u51faPRFL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u9700VAE\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "result": "PRFL\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5956\u52b1\u53cd\u9988\u5b66\u4e60\u6bd4\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Variations in sunlight direction, cloud cover, and shadows break the constant-lighting assumption underlying both classical multi-view stereo (MVS) and structure from motion (SfM) pipelines and recent neural rendering methods, leading to geometry drift, color inconsistency, and shadow imprinting. This issue is especially critical in UAV-based reconstruction, where long flight durations and outdoor environments make lighting changes unavoidable. However, existing datasets either restrict capture to short time windows, thus lacking meaningful illumination diversity, or span months and seasons, where geometric and semantic changes confound the isolated study of lighting robustness. We introduce UAVLight, a controlled-yet-real benchmark for illumination-robust 3D reconstruction. Each scene is captured along repeatable, geo-referenced flight paths at multiple fixed times of day, producing natural lighting variation under consistent geometry, calibration, and viewpoints. With standardized evaluation protocols across lighting conditions, UAVLight provides a reliable foundation for developing and benchmarking reconstruction methods that are consistent, faithful, and relightable in real outdoor environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "UAVLight\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5149\u7167\u9c81\u68d23D\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u91cd\u590d\u98de\u884c\u91c7\u96c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u81ea\u7136\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u89c6\u56fe3D\u91cd\u5efa\u9762\u4e34\u5149\u7167\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8981\u4e48\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7167\u660e\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5305\u542b\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5355\u72ec\u7814\u7a76\u5149\u7167\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u5730\u7406\u53c2\u8003\u98de\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u91c7\u96c6\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u6807\u5b9a\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u63a7\u4f46\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u5149\u7167\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "UAVLight\u4e3a\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5ba4\u5916\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u5fe0\u5b9e\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u3002"}}

Existing defense methods often suffer from (1) high computational overhead and (2) poor generalization ability across diverse attack types. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel yet efficient teacher-student framework, namely Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) for distilling robust 3D point cloud model. It learns lightweight prompts by aligning student point cloud model's features with robust embeddings from three distinct teachers: a vision model processing depth projections, a high-performance 3D model, and a text encoder. To ensure a reliable knowledge transfer, this distillation is guided by a confidence-gated mechanism which dynamically balances the contribution of all input modalities. Notably, since the distillation is all during the training stage, there is no additional computational cost at inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against a wide range of white-box and black-box attacks, while even achieving better performance on clean data.

Implementing computer aided diagnosis systems early on has the potential to greatly improve clinical outcomes. This research intends to use deep learning to build a multiclass classifier for sixteen different oral lesions. To overcome the challenges of limited and imbalanced datasets, the proposed technique combines stratified data splitting and advanced data augmentation and oversampling to perform the classification. The experimental results, which achieved 83.33 percent accuracy, 89.12 percent precision, and 77.31 percent recall, demonstrate the superiority of the suggested model over state of the art methods now in use.

A key limitation is that the standard denoising MSE objective provides no direct supervision on temporal consistency, allowing models to achieve low loss while still generating poor motion. We propose MoGAN, a motion-centric post-training framework that improves motion realism without reward models or human preference data. Built atop a 3-step distilled video diffusion model, we train a DiT-based optical-flow discriminator to differentiate real from generated motion, combined with a distribution-matching regularizer to preserve visual fidelity. With experiments on Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B, MoGAN substantially improves motion quality across benchmarks. On VBench, MoGAN boosts motion score by +7.3% over the 50-step teacher and +13.3% over the 3-step DMD model. On VideoJAM-Bench, MoGAN improves motion score by +7.4% over the teacher and +8.8% over DMD, while maintaining comparable or even better aesthetic and image-quality scores. A human study further confirms that MoGAN is preferred for motion quality (52% vs. 38% for the teacher; 56% vs. 29% for DMD). Overall, MoGAN delivers significantly more realistic motion without sacrificing visual fidelity or efficiency, offering a practical path toward fast, high-quality video generation.

To address this, we propose a self-prompting, point-supervised framework that adapts SAM to RSIs using only sparse point annotations. Our method employs a Refine-Requery-Reinforce loop, where coarse pseudo-masks are generated from initial points (Refine), improved with self-constructed box prompts (Requery), and embeddings are aligned across iterations to reduce confirmation bias (Reinforce). Without relying on full-mask supervision, our approach progressively enhances SAM's segmentation quality and domain robustness through self-guided prompt adaptation . We evaluate our proposed method on three RSI benchmark datasets, including WHU, HRSID, and NWPU VHR-10, showing that our method consistently surpasses pretrained SAM and recent point-supervised segmentation methods.

Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We envision Qwen3-VL serving as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "Qwen3-VL\u662fQwen\u7cfb\u5217\u4e2d\u6700\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u652f\u6301256K token\u7684\u4ea4\u9519\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5bc6\u96c6\u548cMoE\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6838\u5fc3\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u65e0\u7f1d\u6574\u5408\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u957f\u6587\u6863\u5904\u7406\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u73b0\u5b9e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ee3\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u67b6\u6784\u5347\u7ea7\uff1a\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4ea4\u9519MRoPE\u7528\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4-\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\uff1bDeepStack\u96c6\u6210\u5229\u7528\u591a\u7ea7ViT\u7279\u5f81\u52a0\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u4eceT-RoPE\u6f14\u8fdb\u5230\u663e\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684token\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0cQwen3-VL\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u548cMoE\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u90fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728MMMU\u3001MathVista\u3001MathVision\u7b49\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9886\u5148\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Qwen3-VL\u6709\u671b\u6210\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ee3\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001AI\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u5927\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Our approach combines server-side foundation model training with on-device prototype-based classification, enabling efficient error correction through prototype updates rather than model retraining. The system consists of two key components: (1) a server-side pipeline that leverages knowledge distillation to transfer robust feature representations from foundation models to device-compatible architectures, and (2) a device-side mechanism that enables ultra-efficient error correction through prototype adaptation. We demonstrate our system's effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks, achieving over 50% error correction in one-shot scenarios on Food-101 and Flowers-102 datasets while maintaining minimal forgetting (less than 0.02%) and negligible computational overhead.

Long-term AQA, as in figure skating or rhythmic gymnastics, is especially challenging since it requires modeling extended temporal dynamics while remaining robust to contextual confounders. Existing approaches either depend on costly annotations or rely on unidirectional temporal modeling, making them vulnerable to spurious correlations and unstable long-term representations. To this end, we propose CaFlow, a unified framework that integrates counterfactual de-confounding with bidirectional time-conditioned flow. The Causal Counterfactual Regularization (CCR) module disentangles causal and confounding features in a self-supervised manner and enforces causal robustness through counterfactual interventions, while the BiT-Flow module models forward and backward dynamics with a cycle-consistency constraint to produce smoother and more coherent representations. Extensive experiments on multiple long-term AQA benchmarks demonstrate that CaFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance.

However, their ability to follow diverse, fine-grained evaluation criteria remains underexplored. We develop Multi-Crit, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal judges on their capacity to follow pluralistic criteria and produce reliable criterion-level judgments. Covering both open-ended generation and verifiable reasoning tasks, Multi-Crit is built through a rigorous data curation pipeline that gathers challenging response pairs with multi-criterion human annotations. It further introduces three novel metrics for systematically assessing pluralistic adherence, criterion-switching flexibility, and the ability to recognize criterion-level preference conflicts. Comprehensive analysis of 25 LMMs reveals that 1) proprietary models still struggle to maintain consistent adherence to pluralistic criteria--especially in open-ended evaluation; 2) open-source models lag further behind in flexibly following diverse criteria; and 3) critic fine-tuning with holistic judgment signals enhances visual grounding but fails to generalize to pluralistic criterion-level judgment. Additional analyses on reasoning fine-tuning, test-time scaling, and boundary consistency between open-source and proprietary models further probe the limits of current multimodal judges.

However, existing adversarial attack methods require costly end-to-end training and often generate noticeable perturbation patches. To address these limitations, we propose ADVLA, a framework that directly applies adversarial perturbations on features projected from the visual encoder into the textual feature space. ADVLA efficiently disrupts downstream action predictions under low-amplitude constraints, and attention guidance allows the perturbations to be both focused and sparse. We introduce three strategies that enhance sensitivity, enforce sparsity, and concentrate perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that under an $L_{\\infty}=4/255$ constraint, ADVLA combined with Top-K masking modifies less than 10% of the patches while achieving an attack success rate of nearly 100%. The perturbations are concentrated on critical regions, remain almost imperceptible in the overall image, and a single-step iteration takes only about 0.06 seconds, significantly outperforming conventional patch-based attacks. In summary, ADVLA effectively weakens downstream action predictions of VLA models under low-amplitude and locally sparse conditions, avoiding the high training costs and conspicuous perturbations of traditional patch attacks, and demonstrates unique effectiveness and practical value for attacking VLA feature spaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faADVLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f4e\u5e45\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u6709\u6548\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u6e38\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u805a\u7126\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u5e38\u751f\u6210\u660e\u663e\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u5757\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u5bfc\u4f7f\u6270\u52a8\u65e2\u805a\u7126\u53c8\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3001\u5f3a\u5236\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u96c6\u4e2d\u6270\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u5728L\u221e=4/255\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0cADVLA\u7ed3\u5408Top-K\u63a9\u7801\u4fee\u6539\u5c11\u4e8e10%\u7684\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1100%\uff0c\u6270\u52a8\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u56fe\u50cf\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u53ef\u5bdf\u89c9\uff0c\u5355\u6b65\u8fed\u4ee3\u4ec5\u9700\u7ea60.06\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "ADVLA\u5728\u4f4e\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7a00\u758f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u524a\u5f31VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8865\u4e01\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u548c\u660e\u663e\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5bf9\u653b\u51fbVLA\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

To address this difficulty, the proposed research will develop a hybrid deep learning model which integrates U-Net based segmentation and a hybrid DenseNet-VGG classification network with multihead attention and spatial-channel attention capabilities. The segmentation model will precisely demarcate the tumors in a 3D volume of MRI data guided by spatial and contextual information. The classification network which combines a branch of both DenseNet and VGG, will incorporate the demarcated tumor on which features with attention mechanisms would be focused on clinically relevant features. High-dimensional 3D MRI data could successfully be utilized in the model through preprocessing steps which are normalization, resampling, and data augmentation. Through a variety of measures the framework is evaluated: measures of performance in segmentation are Dice coefficient and Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) and measures of performance in classification are accuracy precision, recall, and F1-score. The hybrid framework that has been proposed has demonstrated through physical testing that it has the capability of obtaining a Dice coefficient of 98% in tumor segmentation, and 99% on classification accuracy, outperforming traditional CNN models and attention-free methods. Utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms enhances notions of priority in aspects of the tumor that are clinically significant, and enhances interpretability and accuracy.

This paper is the first to systematically investigate this seemingly implausible question. Towards this end, we propose a contrastive learning framework to train CamFormer, a dedicated encoder that projects camera pose trajectories into a joint embedding space, aligning them with natural language. We find that, contrary to its apparent simplicity, the camera trajectory is a remarkably informative signal to uncover video content. In other words, \"how you move\" can indeed reveal \"what you are doing\" (egocentric) or \"observing\" (exocentric). We demonstrate the versatility of our learned CamFormer embeddings on a diverse suite of downstream tasks, ranging from cross-modal alignment to classification and temporal analysis.

Our key idea is to encode diverse control signals into a single composite canvas image that the model can directly interpret for integrated visual-spatial reasoning. We further curate a suite of multi-task datasets and propose a Multi-Task Canvas Training strategy that optimizes the diffusion model to jointly understand and integrate heterogeneous controls into text-to-image generation within a unified learning paradigm. This joint training enables Canvas-to-Image to reason across multiple control modalities rather than relying on task-specific heuristics, and it generalizes well to multi-control scenarios during inference.

This challenge is particularly acute for medical vision-language models that must preserve complex cross-modal alignments between medical images and clinical terminology across diverse imaging modalities. We introduce Prompt- Aware Adaptive Elastic Weight Consolidation (PA-EWC), a novel continual learning approach that addresses catastrophic forgetting through prompt-guided parameter specialization. Our method systematically categorizes model parameters based on their functional roles in processing visual-descriptive, spatial-guided, and medical-semantic information, enabling targeted protection of critical knowledge while allowing adaptation to new clinical requirements. PA-EWC incorporates adaptive Fisher Information computation with gradient stability analysis and develops weighted complexity metrics based on medical terminology density. We evaluate our approach across five medical imaging datasets (Kvasir-SEG, ISIC 2018, CheXlocalize, BUSI, CAMUS) representing diverse modalities including endoscopy, dermoscopy, radiography, and ultrasound.

Therefore, their correct identification is crucial for diagnosing Hirschsprung disease. We introduce a three-stage segmentation framework based on a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) that mimics the pathologist's diagnostic approach. The framework sequentially segments the muscularis propria, delineates the myenteric plexus, and identifies ganglion cells within anatomically valid regions. 30 whole-slide images of colon tissue were used, each containing expert manual annotations of muscularis, plexus, and ganglion cells at varying levels of certainty. A 5-fold cross-validation scheme was applied to each stage, along with resolution-specific tiling strategies and tailored postprocessing to ensure anatomical consistency. The proposed method achieved a Dice coefficient of 89.9% and a Plexus Inclusion Rate of 100% for muscularis segmentation. Plexus segmentation reached a recall of 94.8%, a precision of 84.2% and a Ganglia Inclusion Rate of 99.7%. For high-certainty ganglion cells, the model achieved 62.1% precision and 89.1% recall, while joint certainty scores yielded 67.0% precision. These results indicate that ViT-based models are effective at leveraging global tissue context and capturing cellular morphology at small scales, even within complex histological tissue structures. This multi-stage methodology has great potential to support digital pathology workflows by reducing inter-observer variability and assisting in the evaluation of Hirschsprung disease.

However, no prior work has attempted to achieve these tasks simultaneously in an end-to-end framework, primarily due to the lack of an effective framework that captures inter-task relevance for mutual improvement and the absence of a mechanism to extract dynamic MRI information effectively. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Task Interaction adversarial learning Network (MTI-Net), a novel integrated framework designed to tackle these tasks simultaneously. MTI-Net incorporates Multi-domain Information Entropy Fusion (MdIEF), which utilizes entropy-aware, high-frequency spectral information to effectively integrate features from both frequency and spectral domains, enhancing the extraction and utilization of dynamic MRI data. The network also introduces a task interaction module that establishes higher-order consistency between segmentation and regression, thus fostering inter-task synergy and improving overall performance. Additionally, we designed a novel task-driven discriminator (TDD) to capture internal high-order relationships between tasks. For dynamic MRI information extraction, we employ a shallow Transformer network to perform positional encoding, which captures the relationships within dynamic MRI sequences. In experiments on a dataset of 238 subjects, MTI-Net demonstrates high performance across multiple tasks, indicating its strong potential for assisting in the clinical assessment of liver tumors.

Compositional explanations aim to answer this question by describing the spatial alignment between neuron activations and concepts through logical rules. These logical descriptions are typically computed via a search over all possible concept combinations. Since computing the spatial alignment over the entire state space is computationally infeasible, the literature commonly adopts beam search to restrict the space. However, beam search cannot provide any theoretical guarantees of optimality, and it remains unclear how close current explanations are to the true optimum. In this theoretical paper, we address this gap by introducing the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations. Specifically, we propose: (i) a decomposition that identifies the factors influencing the spatial alignment, (ii) a heuristic to estimate the alignment at any stage of the search, and (iii) the first algorithm that can compute optimal compositional explanations within a feasible time. Using this framework, we analyze the differences between optimal and non-optimal explanations in the most popular settings for compositional explanations, the computer vision domain and Convolutional Neural Networks. In these settings, we demonstrate that 10-40 percent of explanations obtained with beam search are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. Finally, we evaluate a beam-search variant guided by our proposed decomposition and heuristic, showing that it matches or improves runtime over prior methods while offering greater flexibility in hyperparameters and computational resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u8ba1\u7b97\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6700\u4f18\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u56e0\u7d20\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5f53\u524d\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u771f\u6b63\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\u6846\u67b6\uff1a(i)\u8bc6\u522b\u5f71\u54cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b(ii)\u5728\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u4f55\u9636\u6bb5\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b(iii)\u9996\u4e2a\u80fd\u5728\u53ef\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c10-40%\u7684\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u91cd\u53e0\u6982\u5ff5\u65f6\u662f\u6b21\u4f18\u7684\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u5339\u914d\u6216\u6539\u8fdb\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

Physics-based simulators such as FARSITE offer high-fidelity predictions but are computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in real-time decision-making, while existing deep learning models often yield overly smooth predictions that fail to capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics of wildfire propagation. This study proposes an autoregressive conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) for probabilistic wildfire spread prediction. By formulating the prediction task as an autoregressive problem, the model learns sequential state transitions, ensuring long-term prediction stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CGAN-based model outperforms conventional deep learning models in both overall predictive accuracy and boundary delineation of fire perimeters. These results demonstrate that adversarial learning allows the model to capture the strong nonlinearity and uncertainty of wildfire spread, instead of simply fitting the pixel average. Furthermore, the autoregressive framework facilitates systematic temporal forecasting of wildfire evolution.

Recent deep generative models, including diffusion models and flow matching, employ a single neural network to learn a time- or noise level-dependent vector field. Designing a network architecture to accurately represent this vector field is challenging because the network must integrate information from two different sources: a high-dimensional vector (usually an image) and a scalar. Common approaches either encode the scalar as an additional image input or combine scalar and vector information in specific network components, which restricts architecture choices. Instead, we propose to maintain two learnable parameter sets within a single network and to introduce the scalar dependency by dynamically interpolating between the parameter sets based on the scalar value during training and sampling. DPI is a simple, architecture-agnostic method for adding scalar dependence to a neural network. We demonstrate that our method improves denoising performance and enhances sample quality for both diffusion and flow matching models, while achieving computational efficiency comparable to standard scalar conditioning techniques.

The proposed architecture leverages CNNs for spatial feature extraction and LSTMs for capturing temporal dependencies, enabling efficient handling of complex, time-varying communication signals. The system's practical ability was demonstrated by identifying over-the-air (OTA) signals from a custom-built FM transmitter alongside other modulation schemes. The system was trained on a hybrid dataset combining the RadioML2018 dataset with a custom-generated dataset, featuring samples at Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) from 0 to 30dB. System performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). The optimized model achieved 93.48% accuracy, 93.53% precision, 93.48% recall, and an F1 score of 93.45%. The AUC-ROC analysis confirmed the model's discriminative power, even in noisy conditions.

Although existing methods are pretrained on large vision-language datasets, their inference is still limited to fixed category names, creating a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference. Previous work has shown that improving textual representation can significantly enhance OVOD performance, indicating that the textual space is still underexplored. To this end, we propose OVOD-Agent, which transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, OVOD-Agent extends the textual optimization process into an interpretable Visual-CoT with explicit actions. OVOD's lightweight nature makes LLM-based management unsuitable; instead, we model visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight state spaces, which naturally represents the agent's state, memory, and interaction dynamics. A Bandit module generates exploration signals under limited supervision, helping the agent focus on uncertain regions and adapt its detection policy. We further integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model (RM) optimization, forming a closed loop from Bandit exploration to RM learning.

Our \\textbf{SocialNav} is a foundational model for socially-aware navigation with a hierarchical \"brain-action\" architecture, capable of understanding high-level social norms and generating low-level, socially compliant trajectories. To enable such dual capabilities, we construct the SocNav Dataset, a large-scale collection of 7 million samples, comprising (1) a Cognitive Activation Dataset providing social reasoning signals such as chain-of-thought explanations and social traversability prediction, and (2) an Expert Trajectories Pyramid aggregating diverse navigation demonstrations from internet videos, simulated environments, and real-world robots. A multi-stage training pipeline is proposed to gradually inject and refine navigation intelligence: we first inject general navigation skills and social norms understanding into the model via imitation learning, and then refine such skills through a deliberately designed Socially-Aware Flow Exploration GRPO (SAFE-GRPO), the first flow-based reinforcement learning framework for embodied navigation that explicitly rewards socially compliant behaviors. SocialNav achieves +38% success rate and +46% social compliance rate compared to the state-of-the-art method, demonstrating strong gains in both navigation performance and social compliance.

Among them, single-codebook TTS LLMs have emerged as compact and streamable architectures that jointly model semantic and acoustic integration. However, despite their efficiency, these models often exhibit unstable prosody, speaker drift, and degraded naturalness. To address these issues, we propose a multi-reward Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework that directly optimizes the token generation policy of single-codebook TTS LLMs. Beyond standard intelligibility and speaker similarity objectives, our design integrates three rule-based rewards: a length penalty for duration consistency, an entropy regularization reward for decoding stability, and an LLM-annotated prosody alignment reward that explicitly supervises rhythm. In this prosody reward, an external reasoning LLM predicts multiple plausible pause structures via in-context learning, providing a human-preference-aligned supervisory signal for GRPO training. To assess universality, we further attach a flow-matching (FM) decoder on top of the GRPO-optimized AR backbone and observe consistent additional gains, indicating that our reinforcement optimization enhances the intrinsic AR policy.

Using early fusion, the best model achieves 83.76% accuracy. This surpasses the best text-only baseline by 3.84% and the image-only baseline by 16.91%.

Through a systematic empirical analysis of ViT-S, ViT-B, and ViT-L on ImageNet, we identify a consistent three-phase Cliff-Plateau-Climb pattern that governs how representations evolve with depth. We observe that better performance is associated with progressive marginalization of the [CLS] token, originally designed as a global aggregation hub, in favor of distributed consensus among patch tokens. We quantify patterns of information mixing with an Information Scrambling Index, and show that in ViT-L the information-task tradeoff emerges roughly 10 layers later than in ViT-B, and that these additional layers correlate with increased information diffusion rather than improved task performance. Taken together, these results suggest that transformer architectures in this regime may benefit more from carefully calibrated depth that executes clean phase transitions than from simply increasing parameter count. The Information Scrambling Index provides a useful diagnostic for existing models and suggests a potential design target for future architectures.

Code available: https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/PoseUncertaintySets", "summary": "Quantifying the uncertainty of an object's pose estimate is essential for robust control and planning. Although pose estimation is a well-studied robotics problem, attaching statistically rigorous uncertainty is not well understood without strict distributional assumptions. We develop distribution-free pose uncertainty bounds about a given pose estimate in the monocular setting. Our pose uncertainty only requires high probability noise bounds on pixel detections of 2D semantic keypoints on a known object. This noise model induces an implicit, non-convex set of pose uncertainty constraints. Our key contribution is SLUE (S-Lemma Uncertainty Estimation), a convex program to reduce this set to a single ellipsoidal uncertainty bound that is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. SLUE solves a relaxation of the minimum volume bounding ellipsoid problem inspired by the celebrated S-lemma. It requires no initial guess of the bound's shape or size and is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. For tighter uncertainty bounds at the same confidence, we extend SLUE to a sum-of-squares relaxation hierarchy which is guaranteed to converge to the minimum volume ellipsoidal uncertainty bound for a given set of keypoint constraints. We show this pose uncertainty bound can easily be projected to independent translation and axis-angle orientation bounds. We evaluate SLUE on two pose estimation datasets and a real-world drone tracking scenario. Compared to prior work, SLUE generates substantially smaller translation bounds and competitive orientation bounds.

While videos of other embodiments - humans and different robots - are abundant, differences in embodiment, camera, and environment hinder their direct use. We address the small-data problem by introducing a unifying, symbolic representation - a compact 3D \"trace-space\" of scene-level trajectories - that enables learning from cross-embodiment, cross-environment, and cross-task videos. We present TraceGen, a world model that predicts future motion in trace-space rather than pixel space, abstracting away appearance while retaining the geometric structure needed for manipulation. To train TraceGen at scale, we develop TraceForge, a data pipeline that transforms heterogeneous human and robot videos into consistent 3D traces, yielding a corpus of 123K videos and 1.8M observation-trace-language triplets. Pretraining on this corpus produces a transferable 3D motion prior that adapts efficiently: with just five target robot videos, TraceGen attains 80% success across four tasks while offering 50-600x faster inference than state-of-the-art video-based world models. In the more challenging case where only five uncalibrated human demonstration videos captured on a handheld phone are available, it still reaches 67.5% success on a real robot, highlighting TraceGen's ability to adapt across embodiments without relying on object detectors or heavy pixel-space generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "TraceGen\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D\u8f68\u8ff9\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u3001\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u3001\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u4ec55\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c6\u9891\u4e0b\u8fbe\u523080%\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u6f14\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\uff08\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff09\u6765\u514b\u670d\u5e73\u53f0\u3001\u76f8\u673a\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u793a\u2014\u20143D\u8f68\u8ff9\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1TraceGen\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u8f68\u8ff9\u7a7a\u95f4\u800c\u975e\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u672a\u6765\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528TraceForge\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\u5c06\u5f02\u8d28\u89c6\u9891\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u76843D\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728123K\u89c6\u9891\u548c180\u4e07\u89c2\u5bdf-\u8f68\u8ff9-\u8bed\u8a00\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ec5\u75285\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c6\u9891\u8fbe\u523080%\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5feb50-600\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "TraceGen\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u6216\u7e41\u91cd\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}
