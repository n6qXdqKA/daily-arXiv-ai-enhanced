Despite their advances, these systems remain vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce PHANTOM (PHysical ANamorphic Threats Obstructing connected vehicle Mobility), a novel framework for crafting and deploying perspective-dependent adversarial examples using \\textit{anamorphic art}. PHANTOM exploits geometric distortions that appear natural to humans but are misclassified with high confidence by state-of-the-art object detectors. Unlike conventional attacks, PHANTOM operates in black-box settings without model access and demonstrates strong transferability across four diverse detector architectures (YOLOv5, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet). Comprehensive evaluation in CARLA across varying speeds, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios shows that PHANTOM achieves over 90\\% attack success rate under optimal conditions and maintains 60-80\\% effectiveness even in degraded environments. The attack activates within 6-10 meters of the target, providing insufficient time for safe maneuvering. Beyond individual vehicle deception, PHANTOM triggers network-wide disruption in CAV systems: SUMO-OMNeT++ co-simulation demonstrates that false emergency messages propagate through V2X links, increasing Peak Age of Information by 68-89\\% and degrading safety-critical communication. These findings expose critical vulnerabilities in both perception and communication layers of CAV ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "PHANTOM\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u53d8\u5f62\u827a\u672f\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u89d2\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u653b\u51fb\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7V2X\u901a\u4fe1\u89e6\u53d1\u7f51\u7edc\u7ea7\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u89c9DNN\u548cV2X\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ecd\u6613\u53d7\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u9690\u853d\u3001\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u53d8\u5f62\u827a\u672f\u539f\u7406\u521b\u5efa\u89c6\u89d2\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u5448\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5f62\u4f46\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u8bef\u5bfc\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u9ed1\u76d2\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728CARLA\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\uff0cPHANTOM\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8d85\u8fc790%\uff0c\u6076\u52a3\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4fdd\u630160-80%\u3002\u653b\u51fb\u57286-10\u7c73\u5185\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0cSUMO-OMNeT++\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\u865a\u5047\u7d27\u6025\u4fe1\u606f\u901a\u8fc7V2X\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u4f7f\u4fe1\u606f\u5cf0\u503c\u5e74\u9f84\u589e\u52a068-89%\u3002", "conclusion": "PHANTOM\u66b4\u9732\u4e86CAV\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5c42\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u52a0\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\u3002"}}

Although motion blur obscures image details and degrades visual quality, it also encodes information about scene and camera motion during an exposure. Previous techniques leverage this information to estimate a sharp image from an input blurry one, or to predict a sequence of video frames showing what might have occurred at the moment of image capture. However, they rely on handcrafted priors or network architectures to resolve ambiguities in this inverse problem, and do not incorporate image and video priors on large-scale datasets. As such, existing methods struggle to reproduce complex scene dynamics and do not attempt to recover what occurred before or after an image was taken. Here, we introduce a new technique that repurposes a pre-trained video diffusion model trained on internet-scale datasets to recover videos revealing complex scene dynamics during the moment of capture and what might have occurred immediately into the past or future. Our approach is robust and versatile; it outperforms previous methods for this task, generalizes to challenging in-the-wild images, and supports downstream tasks such as recovering camera trajectories, object motion, and dynamic 3D scene structure.

In a non-robust setting, the ``gold standard'' scoring function, known as the geometric error, follows from a probabilistic model with Gaussian noises. We extend it to spherical noises. In a robust setting, we consider a mixture with uniformly distributed outliers and show that a threshold-based parameterization leads to a unified view of likelihood-based and robust M-estimators and associated local optimization schemes.\n  Next we analyze MAGSAC++ which stands out for two reasons. First, it achieves the best results according to existing benchmarks. Second, it makes quite different modeling assumptions and derivation steps. We discovered, however that the derivation does not correspond to sound principles and the resulting score function is in fact numerically equivalent to a simple Gaussian-uniform likelihood, a basic model within the proposed framework.\n  Finally, we propose an experimental methodology for evaluating scoring functions: assuming either a large validation set, or a small random validation set in expectation. We find that all scoring functions, including using a learned inlier distribution, perform identically.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce HyGE-Occ, a novel framework that leverages a hybrid view-transformation branch with 3D Gaussian and edge priors to enhance both geometric consistency and boundary awareness in 3D panoptic occupancy prediction. HyGE-Occ employs a hybrid view-transformation branch that fuses a continuous Gaussian-based depth representation with a discretized depth-bin formulation, producing BEV features with improved geometric consistency and structural coherence. In parallel, we extract edge maps from BEV features and use them as auxiliary information to learn edge cues.

Prior work focuses largely on web pages and mobile screens, leaving app widgets underexplored. Unlike web or mobile UIs with rich hierarchical context, widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces that summarize key information through dense layouts and iconography under strict spatial constraints. Moreover, while (image, code) pairs are widely available for web or mobile UIs, widget designs are proprietary and lack accessible markup. We formalize this setting as the Widget-to-Code (Widget2Code) and introduce an image-only widget benchmark with fine-grained, multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Benchmarking shows that although generalized multimodal large language models (MLLMs) outperform specialized UI2Code methods, they still produce unreliable and visually inconsistent code. To address these limitations, we develop a baseline that jointly advances perceptual understanding and structured code generation. At the perceptual level, we follow widget design principles to assemble atomic components into complete layouts, equipped with icon retrieval and reusable visualization modules. At the system level, we design an end-to-end infrastructure, WidgetFactory, which includes a framework-agnostic widget-tailored domain-specific language (WidgetDSL) and a compiler that translates it into multiple front-end implementations (e.g., React, HTML/CSS). An adaptive rendering module further refines spatial dimensions to satisfy compactness constraints.

This involves aligning both the cortical surface of the brain and the interior volume. Traditional methods treat volumetric and surface-based registration separately, which often leads to inconsistencies that limit downstream analyses. We propose a deep learning framework, NeurAlign, that registers $3$D brain MRI images by jointly aligning both cortical and subcortical regions through a unified volume-and-surface-based representation. Our approach leverages an intermediate spherical coordinate space to bridge anatomical surface topology with volumetric anatomy, enabling consistent and anatomically accurate alignment. By integrating spherical registration into the learning, our method ensures geometric coherence between volume and surface domains. In a series of experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, our method consistently outperforms both classical and machine learning-based registration methods -- improving the Dice score by up to 7 points while maintaining regular deformation fields. Additionally, it is orders of magnitude faster than the standard method for this task, and is simpler to use because it requires no additional inputs beyond an MRI scan.

Existing approaches lack effective learning of vehicle-related knowledge during pre-training, resulting in poor capability for modeling general vehicle perception representations. To handle this problem, we propose VehicleMAE-V2, a novel vehicle-centric pre-trained large model. By exploring and exploiting vehicle-related multimodal structured priors to guide the masked token reconstruction process, our approach can significantly enhance the model's capability to learn generalizable representations for vehicle-centric perception. Specifically, we design the Symmetry-guided Mask Module (SMM), Contour-guided Representation Module (CRM) and Semantics-guided Representation Module (SRM) to incorporate three kinds of structured priors into token reconstruction including symmetry, contour and semantics of vehicles respectively. SMM utilizes the vehicle symmetry constraints to avoid retaining symmetric patches and can thus select high-quality masked image patches and reduce information redundancy. CRM minimizes the probability distribution divergence between contour features and reconstructed features and can thus preserve holistic vehicle structure information during pixel-level reconstruction. SRM aligns image-text features through contrastive learning and cross-modal distillation to address the feature confusion caused by insufficient semantic understanding during masked reconstruction. To support the pre-training of VehicleMAE-V2, we construct Autobot4M, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 4 million vehicle images and 12,693 text descriptions.

Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \\ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors.

However, existing MIL methods focus on optimizing feature extractors and aggregation strategies while overlooking the complex semantic relationships among instances within whole slide image (WSI). Although Transformer-based MIL approaches aiming to model instance dependencies, the quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability to large-scale WSIs. Moreover, due to the pronounced variations in tumor region scales across different WSIs, existing Transformer-based methods employing fixed-scale attention mechanisms face significant challenges in precisely capturing local instance correlations and fail to account for the distance-based decay effect of patch relevance. To address these challenges, we propose window scale decay MIL (WSD-MIL), designed to enhance the capacity to model tumor regions of varying scales while improving computational efficiency. WSD-MIL comprises: 1) a window scale decay based attention module, which employs a cluster-based sampling strategy to reduce computational costs while progressively decaying attention window-scale to capture local instance relationships at varying scales; and 2) a squeeze-and-excitation based region gate module, which dynamically adjusts window weights to enhance global information modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that WSD-MIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON16 and TCGA-BRCA datasets while reducing 62% of the computational memory.

In a nation like Bangladesh, enhancing guava production and agricultural practices plays a crucial role in its economy. Anthracnose and fruit fly infection can lower the quality and productivity of guava, a crucial tropical fruit. Expert systems that detect diseases early can reduce losses and safeguard the harvest. Images of guava fruits classified into the Healthy, Fruit Flies, and Anthracnose classes are included in the Guava Fruit Disease Dataset 2024 (GFDD24), which comes from plantations in Rajshahi and Pabna, Bangladesh. This study aims to create models using CNN alongside traditional machine learning techniques that can effectively identify guava diseases in locally cultivated varieties in Bangladesh. In order to achieve the highest classification accuracy of approximately 99.99% for the guava dataset, we propose utilizing ensemble models that combine CNNML with Gradient Boosting Machine.

Existing weakly supervised approaches often struggle to align fine-grained spatial structures with coarse labels, leading to noisy supervision and degraded mapping accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose DDTM, a dual-branch weakly supervised framework that explicitly decouples local semantic refinement from global contextual reasoning. Specifically, DDTM introduces a diffusion-based branch to progressively refine fine-scale local semantics under coarse supervision, while a transformer-based branch enforces long-range contextual consistency across large spatial extents. In addition, we design a pseudo-label confidence evaluation module to mitigate noise induced by cross-resolution inconsistencies and to selectively exploit reliable supervisory signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDTM establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Chesapeake Bay benchmark, achieving 66.52\\% mIoU and substantially outperforming prior weakly supervised methods.

However, their application to image animation remains limited, even when trained on large-scale datasets. Two primary challenges contribute to this: the high dimensionality of video signals leads to a scarcity of training data, causing DMs to favor memorization over prompt compliance when generating motion; moreover, DMs struggle to generalize to novel motion patterns not present in the training set, and fine-tuning them to learn such patterns, especially using limited training data, is still under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose Modular Image-to-Video Adapter (MIVA), a lightweight sub-network attachable to a pre-trained DM, each designed to capture a single motion pattern and scalable via parallelization.

Current models can parse simple, single-target commands but fail when presented with complex geospatial scenarios, e.g., segmenting objects at various granularities, executing multi-target instructions, and interpreting implicit user intent. To drive progress against these failures, we present LaSeRS, the first large-scale dataset built for comprehensive training and evaluation across four critical dimensions of language-guided segmentation: hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. By capturing these dimensions, LaSeRS moves beyond simple commands, providing a benchmark for complex geospatial reasoning. This addresses a critical gap: existing datasets oversimplify, leading to sensitivity-prone real-world models. We also propose SegEarth-R2, an MLLM architecture designed for comprehensive language-guided segmentation in RS, which directly confronts these challenges. The model's effectiveness stems from two key improvements: (1) a spatial attention supervision mechanism specifically handles the localization of small objects and their components, and (2) a flexible and efficient segmentation query mechanism that handles both single-target and multi-target scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and other benchmarks, establishing a powerful baseline for the next generation of geospatial segmentation.

This study investigates whether incorporating road-facing views alongside driver-facing footage improves distraction detection accuracy in naturalistic driving conditions. Using synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving, we benchmark three leading spatiotemporal action recognition architectures: SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, and SlowOnly-R50. Each model is evaluated under two input configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view. Results show that while contextual inputs can improve detection in certain models, performance gains depend strongly on the underlying architecture. The single-pathway SlowOnly model achieved a 9.8 percent improvement with dual-view inputs, while the dual-pathway SlowFast model experienced a 7.2 percent drop in accuracy due to representational conflicts. These findings suggest that simply adding visual context is not sufficient and may lead to interference unless the architecture is specifically designed to support multi-view integration.

Current methods often overlook the rich hierarchical structures, such as the semantic hierarchy of primitives (e.g., apple fruit) and the conceptual hierarchy between primitives and compositions (e.g, sliced apple apple). A few recent efforts have shown effectiveness in modeling these hierarchies through loss regularization within Euclidean space. In this paper, we argue that they fail to scale to the large-scale taxonomies required for real-world CZSL: the space's polynomial volume growth in flat geometry cannot match the exponential structure, impairing generalization capacity. To this end, we propose H2em, a new framework that learns Hierarchical Hyperbolic EMbeddings for CZSL. H2em leverages the unique properties of hyperbolic geometry, a space naturally suited for embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. However, a naive hyperbolic mapping may suffer from hierarchical collapse and poor fine-grained discrimination. We further design two learning objectives to structure this space: a Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss that uses hyperbolic entailment cones to enforce the predefined hierarchies, and a Discriminative Alignment Loss with hard negative mining to establish a large geodesic distance between semantically similar compositions. Furthermore, we devise Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention to realize instance-aware cross-modal infusion within hyperbolic geometry. Extensive ablations on three benchmarks demonstrate that H2em establishes a new state-of-the-art in both closed-world and open-world scenarios.

This task is particularly challenging for Mandarin, as visemes are highly ambiguous and homophones are prevalent. We propose VALLR-Pin, a novel two-stage framework that extends the recent VALLR architecture from English to Mandarin. First, a shared video encoder feeds into dual decoders, which jointly predict both Chinese character sequences and their standard Pinyin romanization. The multi-task learning of character and phonetic outputs fosters robust visual-semantic representations. During inference, the text decoder generates multiple candidate transcripts. We construct a prompt by concatenating the Pinyin output with these candidate Chinese sequences and feed it to a large language model to resolve ambiguities and refine the transcription. This provides the LLM with explicit phonetic context to correct homophone-induced errors.

To remove explicit masks at inference, we use self-supervision: we generate mouth-altered variants of the target image, that serve as pseudo ground truth for fine-tuning, teaching the network to localize edits to the lips while preserving the rest. Stage 2 is an audio-to-pose transformer trained with a flow-matching objective to predict lips-poses vectors from speech.

However, progressive image compression with fine granular scalability (FGS)-which enables decoding a single bitstream at multiple quality levels-remains unexplored for machine-oriented codecs. In this work, we propose a novel progressive learned image compression codec for machine perception, PICM-Net, based on trit-plane coding. By analyzing the difference between human- and machine-oriented rate-distortion priorities, we systematically examine the latent prioritization strategies in terms of machine-oriented codecs. To further enhance real-world adaptability, we design an adaptive decoding controller, which dynamically determines the necessary decoding level during inference time to maintain the desired confidence of downstream machine prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enables efficient and adaptive progressive transmission while maintaining high performance in the downstream classification task, establishing a new paradigm for machine-aware progressive image compression.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPICM-Net\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u6001\u5e73\u9762\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5305\u542b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89e3\u7801\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5df2\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u673a\u5668\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u4f46\u9488\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\uff08\u5177\u6709\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff09\u5c1a\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u652f\u6301\u673a\u5668\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u6001\u5e73\u9762\u7f16\u7801\uff08trit-plane coding\uff09\u6784\u5efaPICM-Net\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u673a\u5668\u611f\u77e5\u5728\u7387\u5931\u771f\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89e3\u7801\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u786e\u5b9a\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u7ea7\u522b\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u673a\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "PICM-Net\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u7387\u5931\u771f\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89e3\u7801\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u611f\u77e5\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u4f20\u8f93\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although deep learning-based HAR systems are widely adopted, the impact of Activation Functions (AFs) and Model Optimizers (MOs) on performance has not been sufficiently analyzed, particularly regarding how their combinations influence model behavior in practical scenarios. Most existing studies focus on architecture design, while the interaction between AF and MO choices remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we investigate the effect of three commonly used activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh) combined with four optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad) using two recurrent deep learning architectures, namely BiLSTM and ConvLSTM. Experiments are conducted on six medically relevant activity classes selected from the HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets, considering their suitability for healthcare-oriented HAR applications. Our experimental results show that ConvLSTM consistently outperforms BiLSTM across both datasets. ConvLSTM, combined with Adam or RMSprop, achieves an accuracy of up to 99.00%, demonstrating strong spatio-temporal learning capabilities and stable performance. While BiLSTM performs reasonably well on UCF101, with accuracy approaching 98.00%, its performance drops to approximately 60.00% on HMDB51, indicating limited robustness across datasets and weaker sensitivity to AF and MO variations.

Although previous methods achieve LiDAR point cloud generation from user inputs, they struggle to attain high-quality results while enabling versatile controllability, due to the imbalance between the complex distribution of LiDAR point clouds and the simple control signals. To address the limitation, we propose LiDARDraft, which utilizes the 3D layout to build a bridge between versatile conditional signals and LiDAR point clouds. The 3D layout can be trivially generated from various user inputs such as textual descriptions and images. Specifically, we represent text, images, and point clouds as unified 3D layouts, which are further transformed into semantic and depth control signals. Then, we employ a rangemap-based ControlNet to guide LiDAR point cloud generation.

Existing deterministic networks render observed regions quickly but blur unobserved areas, whereas stochastic diffusion-based methods hallucinate plausible content yet incur heavy training- and inference-time costs. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework that unifies the strengths of both paradigms. A bidirectional transformer encodes multi-view image tokens and Plucker-ray embeddings, producing a shared latent representation. Two lightweight heads then act on this representation: (i) a feed-forward regression head that renders pixels where geometry is well constrained, and (ii) a masked autoregressive diffusion head that completes occluded or unseen regions. The entire model is trained end-to-end with joint photometric and diffusion losses, without handcrafted 3D inductive biases, enabling scalability across diverse scenes. Experiments demonstrate that our method attains state-of-the-art image quality while reducing rendering time by an order of magnitude compared with fully generative baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65b0\u9896\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u6e32\u67d3\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u6e32\u67d3\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u4f46\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u533a\u57df\u6a21\u7cca\uff0c\u800c\u968f\u673a\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5408\u7406\u5185\u5bb9\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u5411Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cftoken\u548cPlucker\u5c04\u7ebf\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u3002\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5934\uff1a\u524d\u9988\u56de\u5f52\u5934\u5904\u7406\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u826f\u597d\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6269\u6563\u5934\u8865\u5168\u906e\u6321\u6216\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u533a\u57df\u3002\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5149\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u548c\u6269\u6563\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u76f8\u6bd4\u5b8c\u5168\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u7ebf\u5c06\u6e32\u67d3\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u968f\u673a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6e32\u67d3\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

While Ground Penetrating Radar and Infrared Thermography enable subsurface defect detection, single modal approaches face complementary constraints radar struggles with moisture and shallow defects, while thermography exhibits weather dependency and limited depth. This paper presents a multi modal attention network fusing radar temporal patterns with thermal spatial signatures for bridge deck delamination detection. Our architecture introduces temporal attention for radar processing, spatial attention for thermal features, and cross modal fusion with learnable embeddings discovering complementary defect patterns invisible to individual sensors. We incorporate uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo dropout and learned variance estimation, decomposing uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components for safety critical decisions. Experiments on five bridge datasets reveal that on balanced to moderately imbalanced data, our approach substantially outperforms baselines in accuracy and AUC representing meaningful improvements over single modal and concatenation based fusion. Ablation studies demonstrate cross modal attention provides critical gains beyond within modality attention, while multi head mechanisms achieve improved calibration. Uncertainty quantification reduces calibration error, enabling selective prediction by rejecting uncertain cases. However, under extreme class imbalance, attention mechanisms show vulnerability to majority class collapse. These findings provide actionable guidance: attention based architecture performs well across typical scenarios, while extreme imbalance requires specialized techniques.

However, existing methods often suffer from multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment, which lead to biases toward louder or larger objects while overlooking weaker, smaller, or co-occurring sources. To address these challenges, we propose DDAVS, a Disentangled Audio Semantics and Delayed Bidirectional Alignment framework. To mitigate multi-source entanglement, DDAVS employs learnable queries to extract audio semantics and anchor them within a structured semantic space derived from an audio prototype memory bank. This is further optimized through contrastive learning to enhance discriminability and robustness. To alleviate audio-visual misalignment, DDAVS introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction, improving the robustness of multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments on the AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks demonstrate that DDAVS consistently outperforms existing approaches, exhibiting strong performance across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios. These results validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our framework under challenging real-world audio-visual segmentation conditions.

Existing pruning approaches treat either tokens or heads in isolation, relying on heuristics or first-order signals, which often sacrifice accuracy or fail to generalize across inputs. We introduce HEART-ViT, a Hessian-guided efficient dynamic attention and token pruning framework for vision transformers, which to the best of our knowledge is the first unified, second-order, input-adaptive framework for ViT optimization. HEART-ViT estimates curvature-weighted sensitivities of both tokens and attention heads using efficient Hessian-vector products, enabling principled pruning decisions under explicit loss budgets.This dual-view sensitivity reveals an important structural insight: token pruning dominates computational savings, while head pruning provides fine-grained redundancy removal, and their combination achieves a superior trade-off. On ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/16 and DeiT-B/16, HEART-ViT achieves up to 49.4 percent FLOPs reduction, 36 percent lower latency, and 46 percent higher throughput, while consistently matching or even surpassing baseline accuracy after fine-tuning, for example 4.7 percent recovery at 40 percent token pruning. Beyond theoretical benchmarks, we deploy HEART-ViT on different edge devices such as AGX Orin, demonstrating that our reductions in FLOPs and latency translate directly into real-world gains in inference speed and energy efficiency.

However, the radar signals are often sparse due to specular reflection, making the extraction of robust features from radar signals highly challenging. To address this, we present milliMamba, a radar-based 2D human pose estimation framework that jointly models spatio-temporal dependencies across both the feature extraction and decoding stages. Specifically, given the high dimensionality of radar inputs, we adopt a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from longer sequences with linear complexity. A Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder then predicts joint coordinates across multiple frames. Together, this spatio-temporal modeling pipeline enables the model to leverage contextual cues from neighboring frames and joints to infer missing joints caused by specular reflections. To reinforce motion smoothness, we incorporate a velocity loss alongside the standard keypoint loss during training. Experiments on the TransHuPR and HuPR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements, exceeding the baselines by 11.0 AP and 14.6 AP, respectively, while maintaining reasonable complexity.

One of the challenges is apple pose estimation, where key points, such as the calyx, are often occluded. Recently developed pose estimation methods no longer rely on these key points, but still require them for annotations, making annotating challenging and time-consuming. Due to the abovementioned occlusions, there can be conflicting and missing annotations of the same fruit between different images. Novel 3D reconstruction methods can be used to simplify annotating and enlarge datasets. We propose a novel pipeline consisting of 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct an orchard scene, simplified annotations, automated projection of the annotations to images, and the training and evaluation of a pose estimation method. Using our pipeline, 105 manual annotations were required to obtain 28,191 training labels, a reduction of 99.6%. Experimental results indicated that training with labels of fruits that are $\\leq95\\%$ occluded resulted in the best performance, with a neutral F1 score of 0.927 on the original images and 0.970 on the rendered images. Adjusting the size of the training dataset had small effects on the model performance in terms of F1 score and pose estimation accuracy. It was found that the least occluded fruits had the best position estimation, which worsened as the fruits became more occluded. It was also found that the tested pose estimation method was unable to correctly learn the orientation estimation of apples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u91cd\u5efa\u679c\u56ed\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u5c06\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u6c42\u51cf\u5c1199.6%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u82f9\u679c\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u679c\u56ed\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u9762\u4e34\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u5927\u3001\u906e\u6321\u4e25\u91cd\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002\u82f9\u679c\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u70b9\uff08\u5982\u82b1\u843c\uff09\u5e38\u88ab\u906e\u6321\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u6807\u6ce8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u50cf\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u75283D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u91cd\u5efa\u679c\u56ed\u573a\u666f\uff1b2) \u7b80\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b3) \u81ea\u52a8\u5c06\u6807\u6ce8\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b4) \u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc73D\u91cd\u5efa\u7b80\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e76\u6269\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u9700105\u4e2a\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f9728,191\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u51cf\u5c1199.6%\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u906e\u6321\u226495%\u7684\u679c\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cfF1\u5206\u65700.927\uff0c\u6e32\u67d3\u56fe\u50cf0.970\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\u3002\u906e\u6321\u6700\u5c11\u7684\u679c\u5b9e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f30\u8ba1\u6700\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u5b66\u4e60\u82f9\u679c\u65b9\u5411\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u6d41\u7a0b\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5e76\u6269\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u679c\u56ed\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u867d\u7136\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f30\u8ba1\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u65b9\u5411\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ecd\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

A considerable challenge for modern low-shot counters are dense regions with small objects. While total counts in such situations are typically well addressed by density-based counters, their usefulness is limited by poor localization capabilities. This is better addressed by point-detection-based counters, which are based on query-based detectors. However, due to limited number of pre-trained queries, they underperform on images with very large numbers of objects, and resort to ad-hoc techniques like upsampling and tiling. We propose CoDi, the first latent diffusion-based low-shot counter that produces high-quality density maps on which object locations can be determined by non-maxima suppression. Our core contribution is the new exemplar-based conditioning module that extracts and adjusts the object prototypes to the intermediate layers of the denoising network, leading to accurate object location estimation. On FSC benchmark, CoDi outperforms state-of-the-art by 15% MAE, 13% MAE and 10% MAE in the few-shot, one-shot, and reference-less scenarios, respectively, and sets a new state-of-the-art on MCAC benchmark by outperforming the top method by 44% MAE.

In this paper, we systematically study multi-teacher distillation for vision foundation models and identify key factors that enable training at lower computational cost. We introduce Agglomerative Mixture-of-Experts Vision Foundation Models (AMoE), which distill knowledge from SigLIP2 and DINOv3 simultaneously into a Mixture-of-Experts student. We show that (1) our Asymmetric Relation-Knowledge Distillation loss preserves the geometric properties of each teacher while enabling effective knowledge transfer, (2) token-balanced batching that packs varying-resolution images into sequences with uniform token budgets stabilizes representation learning across resolutions without sacrificing performance, and (3) hierarchical clustering and sampling of training data--typically reserved for self-supervised learning--substantially improves sample efficiency over random sampling for multi-teacher distillation. By combining these findings, we curate OpenLVD200M, a 200M-image corpus that demonstrates superior efficiency for multi-teacher distillation. Instantiated in a Mixture-of-Experts.

Existing DIR methods are primarily based on image queries that retrieve documents within the same coarse semantic category, e.g., newspapers or receipts. However, these methods struggle to effectively retrieve document images in real-world scenarios where textual queries with fine-grained semantics are usually provided. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new Natural Language-based Document Image Retrieval (NL-DIR) benchmark with corresponding evaluation metrics. In this work, natural language descriptions serve as semantically rich queries for the DIR task. The NL-DIR dataset contains 41K authentic document images, each paired with five high-quality, fine-grained semantic queries generated and evaluated through large language models in conjunction with manual verification. We perform zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations of existing mainstream contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free visual document understanding (VDU) models. A two-stage retrieval method is further investigated for performance improvement while achieving both time and space efficiency.

However, they encounter difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrate, as the pixel-space distortion may not align with human perception. To address this issue, we introduce a Generative Latent Coding (GLC) architecture, which performs transform coding in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), instead of in the pixel space. The generative latent space is characterized by greater sparsity, richer semantic and better alignment with human perception, rendering it advantageous for achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. Additionally, we introduce a categorical hyper module to reduce the bit cost of hyper-information, and a code-prediction-based supervision to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our GLC maintains high visual quality with less than 0.04 bpp on natural images and less than 0.01 bpp on facial images.

The degradations present nonlinear coupling rather than simple superposition, which renders the effective processing of such coupled degradations particularly challenging. Most existing methods focus on designing specific branches, modules, or strategies for specific degradations, with little attention paid to the potential information embedded in their coupling. Consequently, they struggle to effectively capture and process the nonlinear interactions of multiple degradations from a bottom-up perspective. To address this issue, we propose JDPNet, a joint degradation processing network, that mines and unifies the potential information inherent in coupled degradations within a unified framework. Specifically, we introduce a joint feature-mining module, along with a probabilistic bootstrap distribution strategy, to facilitate effective mining and unified adjustment of coupled degradation features. Furthermore, to balance color, clarity, and contrast, we design a novel AquaBalanceLoss to guide the network in learning from multiple coupled degradation losses.

Current multi-modal 3D object detectors often rely on complex architectures and training strategies to achieve higher detection accuracy. However, these methods heavily rely on the LiDAR sensor so that they suffer from large performance drops when LiDAR is absent, which compromises the robustness and safety of autonomous systems in practical scenarios. Moreover, existing multi-modal detectors face difficulties in deployment on diverse hardware platforms, such as NPUs and FPGAs, due to their reliance on 3D sparse convolution operators, which are primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. To address these challenges, we reconsider the role of LiDAR in the camera-LiDAR fusion paradigm and introduce a novel multi-modal 3D detector, LiteFusion. Instead of treating LiDAR point clouds as an independent modality with a separate feature extraction backbone, LiteFusion utilizes LiDAR data as a complementary source of geometric information to enhance camera-based detection. This straightforward approach completely eliminates the reliance on a 3D backbone, making the method highly deployment-friendly. Specifically, LiteFusion integrates complementary features from LiDAR points into image features within a quaternion space, where the orthogonal constraints are well-preserved during network training. This helps model domain-specific relations across modalities, yielding a compact cross-modal embedding. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that LiteFusion improves the baseline vision-based detector by +20.4% mAP and +19.7% NDS with a minimal increase in parameters (1.1%) without using dedicated LiDAR encoders.

However, existing large-scale datasets like PubLayNet and DocBank lack fine-grained region labels and multilingual diversity, making them insufficient for representing complex document layouts. In contrast, human-annotated datasets such as M6Doc and D4LA offer richer labels and greater domain diversity, but are too small to train robust models and lack adequate multilingual coverage. This gap is especially pronounced for Indic documents, which encompass diverse scripts yet remain underrepresented in current datasets, further limiting progress in this space. To address these shortcomings, we introduce IndicDLP, a large-scale foundational document layout dataset spanning 11 representative Indic languages alongside English and 12 common document domains. Additionally, we curate UED-mini, a dataset derived from DocLayNet and M6Doc, to enhance pretraining and provide a solid foundation for Indic layout models.

However, existing methods often depend on explicit degradation priors (e.g., degradation labels) as prompts to guide restoration, which are difficult to obtain due to complex and mixed degradations in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP) framework. Instead of relying on predefined degradation priors, we design spatial-spectral degradation metrics to continuously quantify multi-dimensional degradations, serving as Degradation Prompts (DP). These DP enable the model to capture cross-task similarities in degradation distributions and enhance shared feature learning. Furthermore, we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) that dynamically modulates spatial and spectral feature extraction through learnable parameters. By integrating SSAM as experts within a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, and using DP as the gating router, the framework enables adaptive, efficient, and robust restoration under diverse, mixed, or unseen degradations. Extensive experiments on natural and remote sensing HSI datasets show that DAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates exceptional generalization capability.

However, it has long faced the challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability. Existing approaches often struggle to effectively inject abstract yet strongly discriminative semantic knowledge into pixel-level feature learning, leading to blurred boundaries and class confusion in complex scenes. To address these challenges, we propose Bidirectional Co-Refinement Framework for HRSS (BiCoR-Seg). Specifically, we design a Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS), which establishes a bidirectional information flow between feature maps and class embeddings by generating class-level heatmaps. Based on HBIS, we further introduce a hierarchical supervision strategy, where the interpretable heatmaps generated by each HBIS module are directly utilized as low-resolution segmentation predictions for supervision, thereby enhancing the discriminative capacity of shallow features. In addition, to further improve the discriminability of the embedding representations, we propose a cross-layer class embedding Fisher Discriminative Loss to enforce intra-class compactness and enlarge inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that BiCoR-Seg achieves outstanding segmentation performance while offering stronger interpretability.

Recently, such techniques have been increasingly employed to distort narratives of important events and to spread misinformation on social media, prompting the development of misinformation detectors. In the context of misinformation conveyed through image-text pairs, several detection methods have been proposed. However, these approaches typically rely on computationally intensive architectures or require large amounts of annotated data. In this work we introduce LADLE-MM: Limited Annotation based Detector with Learned Ensembles for Multimodal Misinformation, a model-soup initialized multimodal misinformation detector designed to operate under a limited annotation setup and constrained training resources. LADLE-MM is composed of two unimodal branches and a third multimodal one that enhances image and text representations with additional multimodal embeddings extracted from BLIP, serving as fixed reference space. Despite using 60.3% fewer trainable parameters than previous state-of-the-art models, LADLE-MM achieves competitive performance on both binary and multi-label classification tasks on the DGM4 benchmark, outperforming existing methods when trained without grounding annotations. Moreover, when evaluated on the VERITE dataset, LADLE-MM outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches that utilize more complex architectures involving Large Vision-Language-Models, demonstrating the effective generalization ability in an open-set setting and strong robustness to unimodal bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "LADLE-MM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u6c64\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u652f\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528BLIP\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u8f83\u5c11\u7684\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u8de8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u64cd\u7eb5\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u5e38\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u626d\u66f2\u91cd\u8981\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53d9\u4e8b\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLADLE-MM\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u652f\uff08\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\uff09\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528BLIP\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u793a\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u6c64\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u6a21\u578b\u51cf\u5c1160.3%\u3002", "result": "\u5728DGM4\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cLADLE-MM\u5728\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u548c\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u57fa\u7840\u6807\u6ce8\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728VERITE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f53\u524dSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5bf9\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LADLE-MM\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u56fa\u5b9a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u53c2\u8003\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6c64\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faD\u00b3ETOR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4f2a\u88c5\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u8fa9\u8bba\u589e\u5f3a\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u6e10\u8fdb\u53bb\u504f\u7f51\u7edc\u7f13\u89e3\u6807\u6ce8\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4f2a\u88c5\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u5236\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u7528\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff1b2\uff09\u5ffd\u89c6\u6807\u6ce8\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u6349\u4f2a\u88c5\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u8fa9\u8bba\u589e\u5f3a\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u71b5\u9a71\u52a8\u70b9\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3aSAM\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2\uff09\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u6e10\u8fdb\u53bb\u504f\u7f51\u7edc\uff08FADeNet\uff09\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u591a\u7ea7\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u76d1\u7763\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u4f2a\u88c5\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "D\u00b3ETOR\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5229\u7528\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u6d82\u9e26\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4f2a\u88c5\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e00\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This progress is driven by increasingly sophisticated model architectures, such as ResNets, Vision Transformers, and Hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks, that offer enhanced performance at the cost of greater complexity.

SHAP has emerged as a prominent method for providing interpretable visualizations that aid domain experts in understanding model predictions.

In this study, we address this challenge by using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify the uncertainty that arises from these unstable explanations in medical imaging applications. The framework uses a belief, plausible, and fusion map approach alongside statistical quantitative analysis to produce quantification of uncertainty in SHAP.

With the ultimate goal of building human-like conversational systems, recent studies have explored talking or listening head generation as well as conversational speech generation. However, these works are typically studied in isolation, overlooking the multimodal nature of human conversation, which involves tightly coupled audio-visual interactions. In this paper, we introduce TAVID, a unified framework that generates both interactive faces and conversational speech in a synchronized manner. TAVID integrates face and speech generation pipelines through two cross-modal mappers (i.e., a motion mapper and a speaker mapper), which enable bidirectional exchange of complementary information between the audio and visual modalities. We evaluate our system across four dimensions: talking face realism, listening head responsiveness, dyadic interaction fluency, and speech quality.

They also incur high computational costs due to additional interaction modules introduced into DiTs, while the limited scale and quality of existing public datasets also restrict model generalization and effective training. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, KeyTailor, along with a large-scale, high-definition dataset, ViT-HD. The core idea of KeyTailor is a keyframe-driven details injection strategy, motivated by the fact that keyframes inherently contain both foreground dynamics and background consistency. Specifically, KeyTailor adopts an instruction-guided keyframe sampling strategy to filter informative frames from the input video. Subsequently,two tailored keyframe-driven modules, the garment details enhancement module and the collaborative background optimization module, are employed to distill garment dynamics into garment-related latents and to optimize the integrity of background latents, both guided by keyframes.These enriched details are then injected into standard DiT blocks together with pose, mask, and noise latents, enabling efficient and realistic try-on video synthesis. This design ensures consistency without explicitly modifying the DiT architecture, while simultaneously avoiding additional complexity. In addition, our dataset ViT-HD comprises 15, 070 high-quality video samples at a resolution of 810*1080, covering diverse garments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KeyTailor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of garment fidelity and background integrity across both dynamic and static scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "KeyTailor\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u7ec6\u8282\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6ViT-HD\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u670d\u88c5\u52a8\u6001\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1) \u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u670d\u88c5\u52a8\u6001\uff1b2) \u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u95f4\u80cc\u666f\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff1b3) \u56e0\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5757\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u5c0f\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u4f4e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u6ce8\u5165\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u6307\u4ee4\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u8f93\u5165\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7b5b\u9009\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5e27\uff1b2) \u670d\u88c5\u7ec6\u8282\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ece\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u670d\u88c5\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5230\u670d\u88c5\u76f8\u5173\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b3) \u534f\u4f5c\u80cc\u666f\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0e\u59ff\u6001\u3001\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u8d77\u6ce8\u5165\u6807\u51c6\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5757\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "KeyTailor\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u9759\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u670d\u88c5\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u989d\u5916\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "KeyTailor\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u6ce8\u5165\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f\u4e2d\u7684\u670d\u88c5\u52a8\u6001\u6355\u6349\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002\u914d\u5408\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6ViT-HD\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches often rely on implicit, holistic critiques or unconstrained prompt rewrites, making their behavior difficult to interpret, control, or stop reliably. In contrast, large language models have benefited from explicit, structured forms of **thinking** based on verification, targeted correction, and early stopping.\n  We introduce CRAFT (Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning), a training-free, model-agnostic framework that brings this structured reasoning paradigm to multimodal image generation. CRAFT decomposes a prompt into dependency-structured visual questions, veries generated images using a vision-language model, and applies targeted prompt edits through an LLM agent only where constraints fail. The process iterates with an explicit stopping criterion once all constraints are satised, yielding an interpretable and controllable inference-time renement loop.\n  Across multiple model families and challenging benchmarks, CRAFT consistently improves compositional accuracy, text rendering, and preference-based evaluations, with particularly strong gains for lightweight generators. Importantly, these improvements incur only a negligible inference-time overhead, allowing smaller or cheaper models to approach the quality of substantially more expensive systems. Our results suggest that explicitly structured, constraint-driven inference-time reasoning is a key ingredient for improving the reliability of multimodal generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "CRAFT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9690\u5f0f\u3001\u6574\u4f53\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6216\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u91cd\u5199\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u884c\u4e3a\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u505c\u6b62\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u4fee\u6b63\u548c\u63d0\u524d\u505c\u6b62\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u601d\u8003\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "CRAFT\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u4ec5\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u5931\u8d25\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6240\u6709\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u660e\u786e\u505c\u6b62\u6807\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\u548c\u6311\u6218\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCRAFT\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ec4\u5408\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6587\u672c\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u5e26\u6765\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8981\u7d20\uff0c\u4f7f\u8f83\u5c0f\u6216\u66f4\u4fbf\u5b9c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u63a5\u8fd1\u66f4\u6602\u8d35\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting, recent 2D Gaussian image models improve representation efficiency, yet existing methods struggle to balance compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. To address this issue, we propose SmartSplat, a highly adaptive and feature-aware GS-based image compression framework that supports arbitrary image resolutions and compression ratios. SmartSplat leverages image-aware features such as gradients and color variances, introducing a Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling strategy together with an Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling scheme to improve the non-overlapping coverage of Gaussian primitives in pixel space. In addition, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling method to enhance color initialization across scales. Through joint optimization of spatial layout, scale, and color initialization, SmartSplat efficiently captures both local structures and global textures using a limited number of Gaussians, achieving high reconstruction quality under strong compression. Extensive experiments on DIV8K and a newly constructed 16K dataset demonstrate that SmartSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods at comparable compression ratios and exceeds their compression limits, showing strong scalability and practical applicability.

We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives.

Our method significantly improves Anomaly Detection, boosting F1-score by 11.8 p.p. on challenging low-resolution footage and Anomaly Classification by 3.78 p.p. in high-resolution videos.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faChain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5f02\u5e38\u504f\u5dee\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u76d1\u63a7\u4e2d\u7684\u72af\u7f6a\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u76d1\u63a7\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u6b63\u5e38\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u72af\u7f6a\u3002\u867d\u7136\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f02\u5e38\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u6b63\u5e38\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faChain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT)\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u5f52\u7eb3\u72af\u7f6a\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u805a\u7126\u5206\u7c7b\u5c42\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4bF1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u534711.8\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u53473.78\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "CoAT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5f02\u5e38\u504f\u5dee\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u76d1\u63a7\u4e2d\u7684\u72af\u7f6a\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002"}}

However, when applied to textured defect images, conventional anomaly detection methods have limitations including non-negligible misidentification, low robustness, and excessive reliance on large-scale and structured datasets. This paper proposes a texture basis integrated smooth decomposition (TBSD) approach, which is targeted at efficient anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds and sparse anomalies. Mathematical formulation of quasi-periodicity and its theoretical properties are investigated for image texture estimation. TBSD method consists of two principal processes: the first process learns the texture basis functions to effectively extract quasi-periodic texture patterns; the subsequent anomaly detection process utilizes that texture basis as prior knowledge to prevent texture misidentification and capture potential anomalies with high accuracy.The proposed method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTBSD\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u7eb9\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5728\u5e73\u6ed1\u80cc\u666f\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u5224\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7eb9\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u8bc6\u522b\u7387\u9ad8\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u96c6\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u5206\u89e3(TBSD)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u5b66\u4e60\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u7eb9\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b2) \u5229\u7528\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u7eb9\u7406\u8bef\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u8bef\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "TBSD\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5e73\u6ed1\u80cc\u666f\u4e0a\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc6\u522b\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods overlook physical cues such as joint actuation forces that are fundamental in biomechanics. This gap motivates our study: if and when do physically inferred forces enhance motion understanding? By incorporating forces into established motion understanding pipelines, we systematically evaluate their impact across baseline models on 3 major tasks: gait recognition, action recognition, and fine-grained video captioning. Across 8 benchmarks, incorporating forces yields consistent performance gains; for example, on CASIA-B, Rank-1 gait recognition accuracy improved from 89.52% to 90.39% (+0.87), with larger gain observed under challenging conditions: +2.7% when wearing a coat and +3.0% at the side view. On Gait3D, performance also increases from 46.0% to 47.3% (+1.3). In action recognition, CTR-GCN achieved +2.00% on Penn Action, while high-exertion classes like punching/slapping improved by +6.96%. Even in video captioning, Qwen2.5-VL's ROUGE-L score rose from 0.310 to 0.339 (+0.029), indicating that physics-inferred forces enhance temporal grounding and semantic richness.

While diffusion-based text-to-image models have demonstrated strong capabilities in visual content generation, their text rendering performance, particularly for small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts, remains limited. In this paper, we propose UTDesign, a unified framework for high-precision stylized text editing and conditional text generation in design images, supporting both English and Chinese scripts. Our framework introduces a novel DiT-based text style transfer model trained from scratch on a synthetic dataset, capable of generating transparent RGBA text foregrounds that preserve the style of reference glyphs. We further extend this model into a conditional text generation framework by training a multi-modal condition encoder on a curated dataset with detailed text annotations, enabling accurate, style-consistent text synthesis conditioned on background images, prompts, and layout specifications. Finally, we integrate our approach into a fully automated text-to-design (T2D) pipeline by incorporating pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models and an MLLM-based layout planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UTDesign achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods in terms of stylistic consistency and text accuracy, and also exhibits unique advantages compared to proprietary commercial approaches.

This research evaluates adaptive Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) fusion for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-based detection of surface-laid landmines, leveraging the thermal contrast between the ordnance and the surrounding soil to enhance feature extraction. Using You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures (v8, v10, v11) across 114 test images, generating 35,640 model-condition evaluations, YOLOv11 achieved optimal performance (86.8% mAP), with 10 to 30% thermal fusion at 5 to 10m altitude identified as the optimal detection parameters. A complementary architectural comparison revealed that while RF-DETR achieved the highest accuracy (69.2% mAP), followed by Faster R-CNN (67.6%), YOLOv11 (64.2%), and RetinaNet (50.2%), YOLOv11 trained 17.7 times faster than the transformer-based RF-DETR (41 minutes versus 12 hours), presenting a critical accuracy-efficiency tradeoff for operational deployment. Aggregated multi-temporal training datasets outperformed season-specific approaches by 1.8 to 9.6%, suggesting that models benefit from exposure to diverse thermal conditions. Anti-Tank (AT) mines achieved 61.9% detection accuracy, compared with 19.2% for Anti-Personnel (AP) mines, reflecting both the size differential and thermal-mass differences between these ordnance classes.

We organize the work into five chapters, each addressing unique challenges in multimodal machine learning.\n  Chapter 3 introduces Spatial-Reasoning Bert for translating text-based spatial relations into 2D arrangements between clip-arts. This enables effective decoding of spatial language into visual representations, paving the way for automated scene generation aligned with human spatial understanding.\n  Chapter 4 presents a method for translating medical texts into specific 3D locations within an anatomical atlas. We introduce a loss function leveraging spatial co-occurrences of medical terms to create interpretable mappings, significantly enhancing medical text navigability.\n  Chapter 5 tackles translating structured text into canonical facts within knowledge graphs.

A core challenge lies in effectively handling disparities in dynamic range and focus depth between the inputs. With the advent of vision-language models, recent methods incorporate textual descriptions as auxiliary guidance to enhance fusion quality. However, simply incorporating coarse-grained descriptions hampers the understanding of fine-grained details and poses challenges for precise cross-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-grained Text-guided Image Fusion (MTIF), a novel fusion paradigm with three key designs. First, it introduces multi-grained textual descriptions that separately capture fine details, structural cues, and semantic content, guiding image fusion through a hierarchical cross-modal modulation module.

To bridge this gap across aspects of dataset, benchmark and model, we introduce DSR Suite. First, we propose an automated pipeline that generates multiple-choice question-answer pairs from in-the-wild videos for DSR. By leveraging modern vision foundation models, the pipeline extracts rich geometric and motion information, including camera poses, local point clouds, object masks, orientations, and 3D trajectories. These geometric cues enable the construction of DSR-Train for learning and further human-refined DSR-Bench for evaluation. Compared with previous works, our data emphasize (i) in-the-wild video sources, (ii) object- and scene-level 3D requirements, (iii) viewpoint transformations, (iv) multi-object interactions, and (v) fine-grained, procedural answers. Beyond data, we propose a lightweight Geometry Selection Module (GSM) to seamlessly integrate geometric priors into VLMs, which condenses question semantics and extracts question-relevant knowledge from pretrained 4D reconstruction priors into a compact set of geometry tokens. This targeted extraction avoids overwhelming the model with irrelevant knowledge.

Existing token reduction methods often ignore the textual query or rely on deep attention maps, whose instability under aggressive pruning leads to degraded semantic alignment.\n  We propose FlashVLM, a text guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to the query. Instead of relying on noisy attention weights, FlashVLM computes an explicit cross modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in the language model space. This extrinsic relevance is fused with intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and temperature controlled sharpening. In addition, a diversity preserving partition retains a minimal yet representative set of background tokens to maintain global context.\n  Under identical token budgets and evaluation protocols, FlashVLM achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing the unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8 percent of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5, and maintaining 92.8 percent accuracy even under 94.4 percent compression.

Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Additionally, by integrating perception supervision from our dataset into a shared sim-to-real pipeline, we show consistent gains on the NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks.

Existing methods commonly rely on shallow convolutional backbones such as ResNet that process frames independently, lacking temporal coherence and producing unreliable matching costs under challenging conditions. Through systematic analysis, we find that video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), pre-trained on large-scale real-world videos with spatio-temporal attention, inherently exhibit strong point tracking capability and robustly handle dynamic motions and frequent occlusions. We propose DiTracker, which adapts video DiTs through: (1) query-key attention matching, (2) lightweight LoRA tuning, and (3) cost fusion with a ResNet backbone. Despite training with 8 times smaller batch size, DiTracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging ITTO benchmark and matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models on TAP-Vid benchmarks.

Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling. Extending round-wise tasks of FedPOD to POD units allows flexible design by applying scale-out similar to Kubernetes' auto-scaling.

ORCA embodies Internal World Model (IWM) capabilities through two key innovations: (1) a closed-loop OTAR cycle (Observe-Think-Act-Reflect) that maintains robust state tracking under generative uncertainty by continuously verifying predicted outcomes against actual generations, and (2) a hierarchical dual-system architecture where System 2 performs strategic reasoning with state prediction while System 1 translates abstract plans into precise, model-specific action captions. By formulating avatar control as a POMDP and implementing continuous belief updating with outcome verification, ORCA enables autonomous multi-step task completion in open-domain scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ORCA significantly outperforms open-loop and non-reflective baselines in task success rate and behavioral coherence, validating our IWM-inspired design for advancing video avatar intelligence from passive animation to active, goal-oriented behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "ORCA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u90e8\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u548cOTAR\u95ed\u73af\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u4f7f\u89c6\u9891\u5316\u8eab\u5177\u5907\u4e3b\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u957f\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u88ab\u52a8\u52a8\u753b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u9891\u5316\u8eab\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u6765\u8ffd\u6c42\u957f\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u52a8\u753b\u5411\u4e3b\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faORCA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a1\uff09OTAR\u95ed\u73af\u5faa\u73af\uff08\u89c2\u5bdf-\u601d\u8003-\u884c\u52a8-\u53cd\u601d\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff1b2\uff09\u5206\u5c42\u53cc\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf2\u8fdb\u884c\u6218\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf1\u5c06\u62bd\u8c61\u8ba1\u5212\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff1b\u5c06\u5316\u8eab\u63a7\u5236\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3aPOMDP\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bd\u8fde\u7eed\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "ORCA\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f00\u73af\u548c\u975e\u53cd\u601d\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5185\u90e8\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u5316\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ORCA\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u5316\u8eab\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u52a8\u753b\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u5177\u5907\u4e3b\u52a8\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u90e8\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u95ed\u73af\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive \"thinking\" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels. By building SpatialTree, we provide a proof-of-concept framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faSpatialTree\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u529b\u5206\u4e3a\u56db\u4e2a\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2a\u80fd\u529b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5206\u5c42\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4e\u5c42\u80fd\u529b\u6b63\u4ea4\u800c\u9ad8\u5c42\u80fd\u529b\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d1f\u5411\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u8de8\u5c42\u6b63\u5411\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u601d\u8003\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u6240\u6709\u5c42\u6b21\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u8868\u660e\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u529b\u4ece\u611f\u77e5\u5230\u63a8\u7406\u518d\u5230\u4ea4\u4e92\u9010\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fd9\u79cd\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u72ed\u7a84\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u96c6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u529b\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSpatialTree\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u529b\u5206\u4e3a\u56db\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\uff1a\u4f4e\u5c42\u611f\u77e5(L1)\u3001\u5fc3\u7406\u6620\u5c04(L2)\u3001\u6a21\u62df(L3)\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u529b(L4)\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5206\u7c7b\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2a\u80fd\u529b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5206\u5c42\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u6d41MLLMs\u572827\u4e2a\u5b50\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u8f6c\u79fb\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u601d\u8003\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff1aL1\u6280\u80fd\u57fa\u672c\u6b63\u4ea4\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u5c42\u6280\u80fd\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u9012\u589e\u3002\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u63ed\u793aL1\u5185\u5b58\u5728\u8d1f\u5411\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u4f46\u4ece\u4f4e\u5c42\u5230\u9ad8\u5c42\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u8de8\u5c42\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u663e\u8457\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6734\u7d20\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u800c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u601d\u8003\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u6df1\u601d\u719f\u8651\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5c42\u6b21\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SpatialTree\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6269\u5c55MLLMs\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8f6c\u79fb\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765MLLMs\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

While this approach can generate high-quality videos, it suffers from slow convergence and is computationally expensive when generating long videos. In this paper, we introduce SemanticGen, a novel solution to address these limitations by generating videos in the semantic space. Our main insight is that, due to the inherent redundancy in videos, the generation process should begin in a compact, high-level semantic space for global planning, followed by the addition of high-frequency details, rather than directly modeling a vast set of low-level video tokens using bi-directional attention. SemanticGen adopts a two-stage generation process. In the first stage, a diffusion model generates compact semantic video features, which define the global layout of the video. In the second stage, another diffusion model generates VAE latents conditioned on these semantic features to produce the final output. We observe that generation in the semantic space leads to faster convergence compared to the VAE latent space.

Despite its promise, the evolving network depth comes at the cost of degraded hardware efficiency. In contrast to deep networks, shallow networks can deliver superior hardware efficiency but often suffer from inferior accuracy. To address this dilemma, we propose Double-Win NAS, a novel deep-to-shallow transformable neural architecture search (NAS) paradigm tailored for resource-constrained intelligent embedded systems. Specifically, Double-Win NAS strives to automatically explore deep networks to first win strong accuracy, which are then equivalently transformed into their shallow counterparts to further win strong hardware efficiency. In addition to search, we also propose two enhanced training techniques, including hybrid transformable training towards better training accuracy and arbitrary-resolution elastic training towards enabling natural network elasticity across arbitrary input resolutions. Extensive experimental results on two popular intelligent embedded systems (i.e., NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and NVIDIA Jetson Nano) and two representative large-scale datasets (i.e., ImageNet and ImageNet-100) clearly demonstrate the superiority of Double-Win NAS over previous state-of-the-art NAS approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDouble-Win NAS\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5230\u6d45\u5c42\u53ef\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9ad8\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u7f51\u7edc\u6df1\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u5bfc\u81f4\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u6d45\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u867d\u7136\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDouble-Win NAS\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u81ea\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u5176\u7b49\u4ef7\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6d45\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u3002\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6280\u672f\uff1a\u6df7\u5408\u53ef\u8f6c\u6362\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5f39\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier\u548cNVIDIA Jetson Nano\uff09\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08ImageNet\u548cImageNet-100\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDouble-Win NAS\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684NAS\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Double-Win NAS\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5230\u6d45\u5c42\u7684\u53ef\u8f6c\u6362\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Record-breaking heat waves, drenching rainfalls, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Rapid and efficient response to disaster events is essential for climate resilience and sustainability. A key challenge in disaster response is to accurately and quickly identify disaster locations to support decision-making and resources allocation. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization approach, called ProbGLC, exploring new pathways towards generative location awareness for rapid disaster response. Herein, we combine probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework to simultaneously enhance model explainability (via uncertainty quantification) and achieve state-of-the-art geolocalization performance. Designed for rapid diaster response, the ProbGLC is able to address cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events as well as to offer unique features of probabilistic distribution and localizability score. To evaluate the ProbGLC, we conduct extensive experiments on two cross-view disaster datasets (i.e., MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), consisting diverse cross-view imagery pairs of multiple disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods, to tornadoes). Preliminary results confirms the superior geolocalization accuracy (i.e., 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and model explainability (i.e., via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores) of the proposed ProbGLC approach, highlighting the great potential of leveraging generative cross-view approach to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response.

We unify the complementary strengths of these approaches and investigate how to integrate generative AI advances into real-time, immersive 3D Radiance Field editing.

Researchers have effectively employed the ``pre-train, prompt, and predict'' paradigm through prompt learning to induce improved few-shot performance. However, prompt learning approaches for PFMs still follow a parametric learning paradigm. As such, the stability of generalization in memorization and rote learning can be compromised. More specifically, conventional prompt learning might face difficulties in fully utilizing atypical instances and avoiding overfitting to shallow patterns with limited data during the process of fully-supervised training. To overcome these constraints, we present our approach, named RetroPrompt, which aims to achieve a balance between memorization and generalization by decoupling knowledge from mere memorization. Unlike traditional prompting methods, RetroPrompt leverages a publicly accessible knowledge base generated from the training data and incorporates a retrieval mechanism throughout the input, training, and inference stages. This enables the model to actively retrieve relevant contextual information from the corpus, thereby enhancing the available cues. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a variety of datasets across natural language processing and computer vision tasks to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach, RetroPrompt, in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.

Although previous research has viewed bias amplification as an inherent characteristic of diffusion models, this work provides the first analysis of how sampling algorithms and their hyperparameters influence bias amplification. We empirically demonstrate that samplers for diffusion models -- commonly optimized for sample quality and speed -- have a significant and measurable effect on bias amplification. Through controlled studies with models trained on Biased MNIST, Multi-Color MNIST and BFFHQ, and with Stable Diffusion, we show that sampling hyperparameters can induce both bias reduction and amplification, even when the trained model is fixed.

Submitted to ICPR 2026", "summary": "Multimodal brain decoding aims to reconstruct semantic information that is consistent with visual stimuli from brain activity signals such as fMRI, and then generate readable natural language descriptions. However, multimodal brain decoding still faces key challenges in cross-subject generalization and interpretability. We propose a BrainROI model and achieve leading-level results in brain-captioning evaluation on the NSD dataset. Under the cross-subject setting, compared with recent state-of-the-art methods and representative baselines, metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr show clear improvements. Firstly, to address the heterogeneity of functional brain topology across subjects, we design a new fMRI encoder. We use multi-atlas soft functional parcellations (soft-ROI) as a shared space. We extend the discrete ROI Concatenation strategy in MINDLLM to a voxel-wise gated fusion mechanism (Voxel-gate). We also ensure consistent ROI mapping through global label alignment, which enhances cross-subject transferability. Secondly, to overcome the limitations of manual and black-box prompting methods in stability and transparency, we introduce an interpretable prompt optimization process. In a small-sample closed loop, we use a locally deployed Qwen model to iteratively generate and select human-readable prompts. This process improves the stability of prompt design and preserves an auditable optimization trajectory. Finally, we impose parameterized decoding constraints during inference to further improve the stability and quality of the generated descriptions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faBrainROI\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u529f\u80fd\u5206\u533a\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u89e3\u7801\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8111\u89e3\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8111\u89e3\u7801\u9762\u4e34\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u88ab\u8bd5\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u8111\u62d3\u6251\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684fMRI\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u56fe\u8c31\u8f6f\u529f\u80fd\u5206\u533a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5171\u4eab\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5c06\u79bb\u6563ROI\u62fc\u63a5\u7b56\u7565\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u4f53\u7d20\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u6807\u7b7e\u5bf9\u9f50\u786e\u4fddROI\u6620\u5c04\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b2. \u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\uff1a\u5728\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u95ed\u73af\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u7684Qwen\u6a21\u578b\u8fed\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u8bfb\u63d0\u793a\uff1b3. \u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65bd\u52a0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u89e3\u7801\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728NSD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8111-\u5b57\u5e55\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u9886\u5148\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u5728\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u65b0SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cBLEU-4\u548cCIDEr\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u6709\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "BrainROI\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8111\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u8111\u6d3b\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u5230\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u900f\u660e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Here we introduce Field-Space attention, a mechanism for Earth system Transformers that computes attention in the physical domain rather than in a learned latent space. By maintaining all intermediate representations as continuous fields on the sphere, the architecture enables interpretable internal states and facilitates the enforcement of scientific constraints. The model employs a fixed, non-learned multiscale decomposition and learns structure-preserving deformations of the input field, allowing coherent integration of coarse and fine-scale information while avoiding the optimization instabilities characteristic of standard single-scale Vision Transformers. Applied to global temperature super-resolution on a HEALPix grid, Field-Space Transformers converge more rapidly and stably than conventional Vision Transformers and U-Net baselines, while requiring substantially fewer parameters. The explicit preservation of field structure throughout the network allows physical and statistical priors to be embedded directly into the architecture, yielding improved fidelity and reliability in data-driven Earth system modeling. These results position Field-Space Attention as a compact, interpretable, and physically grounded building block for next-generation Earth system prediction and generative modeling frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faField-Space Attention\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u7269\u7406\u57df\u800c\u975e\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8fde\u7eed\u5730\u7403\u7269\u7406\u573a\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5730\u7403\u7cfb\u7edfTransformer", "motivation": "\u9700\u8981\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u8fde\u7eed\u5730\u7403\u7269\u7406\u573a\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u5e95\u5c42\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5730\u7403\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Field-Space Attention\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u7269\u7406\u57df\u8ba1\u7b97\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u975e\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u89e3\uff1b\u5b66\u4e60\u8f93\u5165\u573a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u53d8\u5f62\uff1b\u5728HEALPix\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u7403\u6e29\u5ea6\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5e94\u7528", "result": "Field-Space Transformer\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfVision Transformer\u548cU-Net\u57fa\u7ebf\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\uff1b\u4fdd\u6301\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5148\u9a8c\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5730\u7403\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027", "conclusion": "Field-Space Attention\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u5757\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u5730\u7403\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411"}}

Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) scans provide complementary information on acute and sub-acute ischemic changes; however, automated lesion delineation remains challenging due to variability in lesion appearance.\n  In this work, we study ischemic stroke lesion segmentation using multimodal diffusion MRI from the ISLES 2022 dataset. Several state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based architectures, including U-Net variants, Swin-UNet, and TransUNet, are benchmarked. Based on performance, a dual-encoder TransUNet architecture is proposed to learn modality-specific representations from DWI and ADC inputs.

Here, we introduce a 3D display system comprising a digital encoder and a diffractive optical decoder, which simultaneously projects different images onto multiple target axial planes with high axial resolution. By leveraging multi-layer diffractive wavefront decoding and deep learning-based end-to-end optimization, the system achieves high-fidelity depth-resolved 3D image projection in a snapshot, enabling axial plane separations on the order of a wavelength. The digital encoder leverages a Fourier encoder network to capture multi-scale spatial and frequency-domain features from input images, integrates axial position encoding, and generates a unified phase representation that simultaneously encodes all images to be axially projected in a single snapshot through a jointly-optimized diffractive decoder. We characterized the impact of diffractive decoder depth, output diffraction efficiency, spatial light modulator resolution, and axial encoding density, revealing trade-offs that govern axial separation and 3D image projection quality. We further demonstrated the capability to display volumetric images containing 28 axial slices, as well as the ability to dynamically reconfigure the axial locations of the image planes, performed on demand. Finally, we experimentally validated the presented approach, demonstrating close agreement between the measured results and the target images. These results establish the diffractive 3D display system as a compact and scalable framework for depth-resolved snapshot 3D image projection, with potential applications in holographic displays, AR/VR interfaces, and volumetric optical computing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u884d\u5c04\u5149\u5b66\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u76843D\u663e\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8f74\u5411\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u591a\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u50cf\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u8f74\u5411\u5206\u79bb\u53ef\u8fbe\u6ce2\u957f\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u4f53\u6210\u50cf\u9700\u89813D\u56fe\u50cf\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u5bc6\u96c6\u6df1\u5ea6\u590d\u7528\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u968f\u7740\u8f74\u5411\u5e73\u9762\u95f4\u8ddd\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u884d\u5c04\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4e32\u6270\u4f1a\u8fc5\u901f\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8f74\u5411\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u591a\u5e73\u9762\u6295\u5f71\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7531\u6570\u5b57\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u884d\u5c04\u5149\u5b66\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7ec4\u6210\u3002\u6570\u5b57\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7f16\u7801\u7f51\u7edc\u6355\u83b7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u9891\u57df\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u8f74\u5411\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7edf\u4e00\u76f8\u4f4d\u8868\u793a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c42\u884d\u5c04\u6ce2\u524d\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u6b21\u5feb\u7167\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u8fa83D\u56fe\u50cf\u6295\u5f71\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8628\u4e2a\u8f74\u5411\u5207\u7247\u7684\u4f53\u56fe\u50cf\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8f74\u5411\u5e73\u9762\u95f4\u8ddd\u53ef\u8fbe\u6ce2\u957f\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u65b0\u914d\u7f6e\u56fe\u50cf\u5e73\u9762\u8f74\u5411\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u884d\u5c043D\u663e\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u8fa8\u5feb\u71673D\u56fe\u50cf\u6295\u5f71\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5168\u606f\u663e\u793a\u3001AR/VR\u754c\u9762\u548c\u4f53\u5149\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Cube available at https://github.com/dana-23/cube-bench", "summary": "We introduce Cube Bench, a Rubik's-cube benchmark for evaluating spatial and sequential reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The benchmark decomposes performance into five skills: (i) reconstructing cube faces from images and text, (ii) choosing the optimal next move, (iii) predicting the outcome of a candidate move without applying it, (iv) executing multi-step plans while recovering from mistakes, and (v) detecting and revising one's own errors. Using a shared set of scrambled cube states, identical prompts and parsers, and a single distance-to-solved metric, we compare recent MLLMs side by side as a function of scramble depth. Across seven MLLMs, accuracy drops sharply with depth; once a trajectory stalls or diverges, models rarely recover, and high face-reconstruction accuracy does not guarantee competent action selection or multi-step execution. A pronounced closed- vs open-source gap emerges: the strongest closed model leads on both single-step perception tasks and multi-step control tasks, while open-weight models cluster near chance on the hardest settings; yet even the best MLLM degrades at higher cube complexity. A simple self-correction via reflective thinking yields modest gains but can also introduce overthinking.

We propose a multi-agent framework in which a master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments and a vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories. On our proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ which are episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+, our multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines. Experiments also show reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning for the trained agent.
