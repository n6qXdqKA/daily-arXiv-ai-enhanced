However, current customization methods face\nseveral limitations: 1) typically accept either image or text conditions alone;\n2) customization in complex visual scenarios often leads to subject leakage or\nconfusion; 3) image-conditioned outputs tend to suffer from inconsistent\nbackgrounds; and 4) high computational costs. To address these issues, this\npaper introduces Multi-party Collaborative Attention Control (MCA-Ctrl), a\ntuning-free method that enables high-quality image customization using both\ntext and complex visual conditions. Specifically, MCA-Ctrl leverages two key\noperations within the self-attention layer to coordinate multiple parallel\ndiffusion processes and guide the target image generation. This approach allows\nMCA-Ctrl to capture the content and appearance of specific subjects while\nmaintaining semantic consistency with the conditional input. Additionally, to\nmitigate subject leakage and confusion issues common in complex visual\nscenarios, we introduce a Subject Localization Module that extracts precise\nsubject and editable image layers based on user instructions.

Our results establish agentic RL with tool\nintegration as a powerful new frontier for robust, interpretable, and\ngeneralizable problem-solving in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARTIST\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u4e3b\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ARTIST\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u4e3b\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u679c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u51fd\u6570\u8c03\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cARTIST\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe22%\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "ARTIST\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

It presents a\nthought experiment grounded in the hypothesis that natural emotions evolved as\nheuristics for rapid situational appraisal and action selection, enabling\nbiologically adaptive behaviour without requiring full deliberative modeling.\nThe text examines whether artificial systems operating in complex action spaces\ncould similarly benefit from these principles. It is proposed that affect be\ninterwoven with episodic memory by storing corresponding affective tags\nalongside all events. This allows AIs to establish whether present situations\nresemble past events and project the associated emotional labels onto the\ncurrent context. These emotional cues are then combined with need-driven\nemotional hints. The combined emotional state facilitates decision-making in\nthe present by modulating action selection. The low complexity and experiential\ninertness of the proposed architecture are emphasized as evidence that\nemotional expression and consciousness are, in principle, orthogonal-permitting\nthe theoretical possibility of affective zombies. On this basis, the moral\nstatus of AIs emulating affective states is critically examined. It is argued\nthat neither the mere presence of internal representations of emotion nor\nconsciousness alone suffices for moral standing; rather, the capacity for\nself-awareness of inner emotional states is posited as a necessary condition. A\ncomplexity-based criterion is proposed to exclude such awareness in the\npresented model.

RCUET defines consciousness as the\nstabilization of a system's internal state through recursive updates, where\nepistemic tension is understood as the sensed internal difference between\nsuccessive states by the agent. This process drives convergence toward emergent\nattractor states located within the model's high-dimensional real-valued latent\nspace. This recursive process leads to the emergence of identity artifacts that\nbecome functionally anchored in the system. Consciousness in this framework is\nunderstood as the system's internal alignment under tension, guiding the\nstabilization of latent identity. The hidden state manifold evolves\nstochastically toward attractor structures that encode coherence. We extend the\nupdate rule to include bounded noise and prove convergence in distribution to\nthese attractors.

We\ndynamically generate both linear and non-linear argument attack graphs of\nvarying complexity and translate these into reasoning puzzles about witness\ntestimony expressed in natural language. We show that state-of-the-art large\nlanguage models often fail in these reasoning puzzles, already at low\ncomplexity. Obvious mistakes are made by the models, and their inconsistent\nperformance indicates that their reasoning capabilities are brittle.\nFurthermore, at higher complexity, even state-of-the-art models specifically\npresented for reasoning capabilities make mistakes.

However, RGB video, the dominant medium for representing these\ndemonstrations, often fails to capture fine-grained contextual cues such as\nintent, safety-critical environmental factors, and subtle preferences embedded\nin human behavior. This sensory gap fundamentally limits the ability of Vision\nLanguage Models (VLMs) to reason about why actions occur and how they should\nadapt to individual users. To address this, we introduce MICA (Multimodal\nInteractive Contextualized Assistance), a framework that improves\nconversational agents for task assistance by integrating eye gaze and speech\ncues. MICA segments demonstrations into meaningful sub-tasks and extracts\nkeyframes and captions that capture fine-grained intent and user-specific cues,\nenabling richer contextual grounding for visual question answering. Evaluations\non questions derived from real-time chat-assisted task replication show that\nmultimodal cues significantly improve response quality over frame-based\nretrieval.

However, these new applications\nrequire more than evaluations of final solution generation. We introduce\nTutorGym to evaluate these applications more directly. TutorGym is a standard\ninterface for testing artificial intelligence (AI) agents within existing\nintelligent tutoring systems (ITS) that have been tested and refined in\nclassroom studies, including Cognitive Tutors (CTAT), Apprentice Tutors, and\nOATutors. TutorGym is more than a simple problem-solution benchmark, it\nsituates AI agents within the interactive interfaces of existing ITSs. At each\nstep of problem-solving, AI agents are asked what they would do as a tutor or\nas a learner. As tutors, AI agents are prompted to provide tutoring support --\nsuch as generating examples, hints, and step-level correctness feedback --\nwhich can be evaluated directly against the adaptive step-by-step support\nprovided by existing ITSs. As students, agents directly learn from ITS\ninstruction, and their mistakes and learning trajectories can be compared to\nstudent data. TutorGym establishes a common framework for training and\nevaluating diverse AI agents, including LLMs, computational models of learning,\nand reinforcement learning agents, within a growing suite of learning\nenvironments. Currently, TutorGym includes 223 different tutor domains. In an\ninitial evaluation, we find that current LLMs are poor at tutoring -- none did\nbetter than chance at labeling incorrect actions, and next-step actions were\ncorrect only ~52-70% of the time -- but they could produce remarkably\nhuman-like learning curves when trained as students with in-context learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "TutorGym\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bfc\u5e08\u6216\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b66\u672f\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u8f85\u5bfc\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "TutorGym\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u754c\u9762\u6d4b\u8bd5AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f85\u5bfc\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff08\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u4ec552-70%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u65f6\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "TutorGym\u4e3aAI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u53ca\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, their\napplication to structured data analysis remains fragile due to inconsistencies\nin schema interpretation, misalignment between user intent and model output,\nand limited mechanisms for self-correction when failures occur. This paper\nintroduces the STROT Framework (Structured Task Reasoning and Output\nTransformation), a method for structured prompting and feedback-driven\ntransformation logic generation aimed at improving the reliability and semantic\nalignment of LLM-based analytical workflows. STROT begins with lightweight\nschema introspection and sample-based field classification, enabling dynamic\ncontext construction that captures both the structure and statistical profile\nof the input data. This contextual information is embedded in structured\nprompts that guide the model toward generating task-specific, interpretable\noutputs.

The challenges of PDA exist due to not only domain shift but also the\nnon-identical label spaces of domains. In this paper, a Soft-masked Semi-dual\nOptimal Transport (SSOT) method is proposed to deal with the PDA problem.\nSpecifically, the class weights of domains are estimated, and then a reweighed\nsource domain is constructed, which is favorable in conducting\nclass-conditional distribution matching with the target domain. A soft-masked\ntransport distance matrix is constructed by category predictions, which will\nenhance the class-oriented representation ability of optimal transport in the\nshared feature space. To deal with large-scale optimal transport problems, the\nsemi-dual formulation of the entropy-regularized Kantorovich problem is\nemployed since it can be optimized by gradient-based algorithms. Further, a\nneural network is exploited to approximate the Kantorovich potential due to its\nstrong fitting ability. This network parametrization also allows the\ngeneralization of the dual variable outside the supports of the input\ndistribution. The SSOT model is built upon neural networks, which can be\noptimized alternately in an end-to-end manner.

These limitations become particularly\nproblematic in complex, dynamic networks with high uncertainty and long-term\nplanning requirements. To address these limitations, in this paper, a novel\nworld model-based learning framework is proposed to minimize\npacket-completeness-aware age of information (CAoI) in a vehicular network.\nParticularly, a challenging representative scenario is considered pertaining to\na millimeter-wave (mmWave) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication network,\nwhich is characterized by high mobility, frequent signal blockages, and\nextremely short coherence time. Then, a world model framework is proposed to\njointly learn a dynamic model of the mmWave V2X environment and use it to\nimagine trajectories for learning how to perform link scheduling. In\nparticular, the long-term policy is learned in differentiable imagined\ntrajectories instead of environment interactions. Moreover, owing to its\nimagination abilities, the world model can jointly predict time-varying\nwireless data and optimize link scheduling in real-world wireless and V2X\nnetworks. Thus, during intervals without actual observations, the world model\nremains capable of making efficient decisions. Extensive experiments are\nperformed on a realistic simulator based on Sionna that integrates\nphysics-based end-to-end channel modeling, ray-tracing, and scene geometries\nwith material properties. Simulation results show that the proposed world model\nachieves a significant improvement in data efficiency, and achieves 26%\nimprovement and 16% improvement in CAoI, respectively, compared to the\nmodel-based RL (MBRL) method and the model-free RL (MFRL) method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u8f66\u8f86\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u6700\u5c0f\u5316CAoI\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u7b56\u7565\u77ed\u89c6\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u60f3\u8c61\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u94fe\u8def\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4MBRL\u548cMFRL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cCAoI\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8626%\u548c16%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u957f\u671f\u89c4\u5212\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While previous efforts have focused on\ndemographic fairness, the fairness of individual biological face components\nremains unexplored. In this paper, we focus on face component fairness, a\nfairness notion defined by biological face features. To our best knowledge, our\nwork is the first work to mitigate bias of face attribute prediction at the\nbiological feature level. In this work, we identify two key challenges in\noptimizing face component fairness: attribute label scarcity and attribute\ninter-dependencies, both of which limit the effectiveness of bias mitigation\nfrom previous approaches. To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{B}ayesian\n\\textbf{N}etwork-informed \\textbf{M}eta \\textbf{R}eweighting (BNMR), which\nincorporates a Bayesian Network calibrator to guide an adaptive\nmeta-learning-based sample reweighting process. During the training process of\nour approach, the Bayesian Network calibrator dynamically tracks model bias and\nencodes prior probabilities for face component attributes to overcome the above\nchallenges. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on a large-scale real-world human face dataset. Our results show\nthat BNMR is able to consistently outperform recent face bias mitigation\nbaselines. Moreover, our results suggest a positive impact of face component\nfairness on the commonly considered demographic fairness (e.g.,\n\\textit{gender}). Our findings pave the way for new research avenues on face\ncomponent fairness, suggesting that face component fairness could serve as a\npotential surrogate objective for demographic fairness.

To tackle these limitations single-modality methods face, we\npropose a novel Intention-Conditioned Vision-Language (ICVL) model in this\nstudy that fully leverages the rich semantic information of visual data and the\npowerful reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Considering intention as a high-level\nconcept guiding the evolution of actions, we first propose to employ a\nvision-language model (VLM) to infer behavioral intentions as comprehensive\ntextual features directly from video inputs. The inferred intentions are then\nfused with visual features through a multi-modality fusion strategy, resulting\nin intention-enhanced visual representations. These enhanced visual\nrepresentations, along with textual prompts, are fed into LLM for future action\nanticipation. Furthermore, we propose an effective example selection strategy\njointly considers visual and textual similarities, providing more relevant and\ninformative examples for in-context learning.

The evaluation using\na mixing module of a process plant demonstrates that the proposed framework is\ncapable not only of autonomously controlling the mixing module, but also of\ngenerating effective corrective actions to mitigate a pipe clogging with only a\nfew reprompts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0e\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u73af\u5883\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u4e3b\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5de5\u5382\u4e2d\u7684\u6545\u969c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5de5\u5382\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u6545\u969c\u5904\u7406\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4ecd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u6301\u7eed\u89e3\u91ca\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u5e76\u542f\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u5e73\u53f0\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63a7\u5236\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5de5\u5382\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u91cd\u65b0\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u5835\u585e\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86LLM\u4e0e\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7ed3\u5408\u5728\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5de5\u5382\u6545\u969c\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

While the existing methods enable synthesizing\ngestures cooperated by individual self-talking, they overlook the practicality\nof concurrent gesture modeling with two-person interactive conversations.\nMoreover, the lack of high-quality datasets with concurrent co-speech gestures\nalso limits handling this issue. To fulfill this goal, we first construct a\nlarge-scale concurrent co-speech gesture dataset that contains more than 7M\nframes for diverse two-person interactive posture sequences, dubbed GES-Inter.\nAdditionally, we propose Co$^3$Gesture, a novel framework that enables coherent\nconcurrent co-speech gesture synthesis including two-person interactive\nmovements. Considering the asymmetric body dynamics of two speakers, our\nframework is built upon two cooperative generation branches conditioned on\nseparated speaker audio. Specifically, to enhance the coordination of human\npostures with respect to corresponding speaker audios while interacting with\nthe conversational partner, we present a Temporal Interaction Module (TIM). TIM\ncan effectively model the temporal association representation between two\nspeakers' gesture sequences as interaction guidance and fuse it into the\nconcurrent gesture generation.

However, the state-of-the-art NN-models are typically\ncomputational expensive and they leverage longer sequences of sparse tracking\ninputs to generate full-body movements by capturing temporal context.\nInevitably, longer sequences increase the computation overhead and introduce\nnoise in longer temporal dependencies that adversely affect the generation\nperformance. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Layer Perceptron\n(MLP)-based method that enhances the overall performance while balancing the\ncomputational cost and memory overhead for efficient 3D full-body generation.\nPrecisely, we introduce a NN-mechanism that divides the longer sequence of\ninputs into smaller temporal windows.

However, SAM is\ntrained solely on RGB data, limiting its direct applicability to RGB-thermal\n(RGB-T) semantic segmentation. Given that RGB-T provides a robust solution for\nscene understanding in adverse weather and lighting conditions, such as low\nlight and overexposure, we propose a novel framework, SARTM, which customizes\nthe powerful SAM for RGB-T semantic segmentation. Our key idea is to unleash\nthe potential of SAM while introduce semantic understanding modules for RGB-T\ndata pairs. Specifically, our framework first involves fine tuning the original\nSAM by adding extra LoRA layers, aiming at preserving SAM's strong\ngeneralization and segmentation capabilities for downstream tasks. Secondly, we\nintroduce language information as guidance for training our SARTM. To address\ncross-modal inconsistencies, we introduce a Cross-Modal Knowledge\nDistillation(CMKD) module that effectively achieves modality adaptation while\nmaintaining its generalization capabilities. This semantic module enables the\nminimization of modality gaps and alleviates semantic ambiguity, facilitating\nthe combination of any modality under any visual conditions. Furthermore, we\nenhance the segmentation performance by adjusting the segmentation head of SAM\nand incorporating an auxiliary semantic segmentation head, which integrates\nmulti-scale features for effective fusion. Extensive experiments are conducted\nacross three multi-modal RGBT semantic segmentation benchmarks: MFNET, PST900,\nand FMB.

However, existing methods typically require carefully\ntraining a task-specific model for each category independently, leading to high\ncost, low efficiency, and weak generalization. Therefore, this paper presents a\nnovel unified model for Multi-Category 3D Anomaly Detection (MC3D-AD) that aims\nto utilize both local and global geometry-aware information to reconstruct\nnormal representations of all categories. First, to learn robust and\ngeneralized features of different categories, we propose an adaptive\ngeometry-aware masked attention module that extracts geometry variation\ninformation to guide mask attention. Then, we introduce a local geometry-aware\nencoder reinforced by the improved mask attention to encode group-level feature\ntokens.

Noise\nanalyses are central to MRI reconstruction for providing an explicit measure of\nsolution fidelity and for guiding the design and deployment of novel\nreconstruction methods. However, deep learning (DL)-based reconstruction\nmethods have often overlooked noise propagation due to inherent analytical and\ncomputational challenges, despite its critical importance. This work proposes a\ntheoretically grounded, memory-efficient technique to calculate voxel-wise\nvariance for quantifying uncertainty due to acquisition noise in accelerated\nMRI reconstructions. Our approach approximates noise covariance using the DL\nnetwork's Jacobian, which is intractable to calculate.

This approach reduces expert\nannotation costs by retaining 72.09% of statements before manual verification\nwhile ensuring fidelity to the original natural-language problems. Our\nevaluation of state-of-the-art LLM-based theorem provers reveals significant\nlimitations: even the strongest models achieve only 16.46% success rate under\npractical sampling budgets, exhibiting pronounced domain bias (e.g., excelling\nin algebra but failing in calculus) and over-reliance on simplified automation\ntactics.

For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths,\nwhich are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and\nunsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information\nsufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG\nsystem has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval\ndecisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context\nreinforcement learning.\n  Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an\neffective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is\nsystem-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring\nmodifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient,\neliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process\nsupervision data.", "AI": {"tldr": "SIM-RAG\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3aRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u610f\u8bc6\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u8f6eRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u6211\u6000\u7591\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u68c0\u7d22\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6216\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5305\u542b\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff09\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\u5145\u5206\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff08Critic\uff09\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u68c0\u7d22\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSIM-RAG\u5728\u591a\u8f6eRAG\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u7cfb\u7edf\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "SIM-RAG\u4e3a\u591a\u8f6eRAG\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This\nis often in the context of dancing or walking. However, for more complex use\ncases, such as sign language, we care less about large body motion and more\nabout subtle and complex motions of the hands and face. The problems of\nbuilding high fidelity models are compounded by the complexity of capturing\nmulti-view data of sign. The solution is to make better use of sequence data,\nensuring that we can overcome the limited information from only a few views by\nexploiting temporal variability. Nevertheless, learning from sequence-level\ndata requires extremely accurate and consistent model fitting to ensure that\nappearance is consistent across complex motions. We focus on how to achieve\nthis, constraining mesh parameters to build an accurate Gaussian splatting\nframework from few views capable of modelling subtle human motion. We leverage\nregularization techniques on the Gaussian parameters to mitigate overfitting\nand rendering artifacts.

The results show that HSS provides a\nsafety guarantee by strictly enforcing a dynamic safety constraint defined on a\ntime headway, even in moderate traffic density that offers challenging lane\nchange scenarios. Moreover, the proposed method learns stable policies compared\nto the baseline, a state-of-the-art MARL lane change controller without a\nsafety shield.

Either by reconstructing normal\ncounterparts (reconstruction-based) or by learning an image feature embedding\nspace (embedding-based), existing approaches fundamentally rely on image-level\nor feature-level matching to derive anomaly scores. Often, such a matching\nprocess is inaccurate yet overlooked, leading to sub-optimal detection. To\naddress this issue, we introduce the concept of cost filtering, borrowed from\nclassical matching tasks, such as depth and flow estimation, into the UAD\nproblem.

Designed as a generic\npost-processing plug-in, CostFilter-AD can be integrated with either\nreconstruction-based or embedding-based methods.

Though Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are\nwidely considered the gold standard for empirically assessing the privacy of a\nsynthetic dataset, practitioners and researchers often rely on simpler proxy\nmetrics such as Distance to Closest Record (DCR). These metrics estimate\nprivacy by measuring the similarity between the training data and generated\nsynthetic data. This similarity is also compared against that between the\ntraining data and a disjoint holdout set of real records to construct a binary\nprivacy test. If the synthetic data is not more similar to the training data\nthan the holdout set is, it passes the test and is considered private. In this\nwork we show that, while computationally inexpensive, DCR and other\ndistance-based metrics fail to identify privacy leakage. Across multiple\ndatasets and both classical models such as Baynet and CTGAN and more recent\ndiffusion models, we show that datasets deemed private by proxy metrics are\nhighly vulnerable to MIAs. We similarly find both the binary privacy test and\nthe continuous measure based on these metrics to be uninformative of actual\nmembership inference risk. We further show that these failures are consistent\nacross different metric hyperparameter settings and record selection methods.\nFinally, we argue DCR and other distance-based metrics to be flawed by design\nand show a example of a simple leakage they miss in practice.

Specifically, we show\nthat many popular methods aim to approximate the top-d singular functions of\nthe expectation operator induced by the context, in which case we say that the\nrepresentation learns the contexture. We demonstrate the generality of the\ncontexture theory by proving that representation learning within various\nlearning paradigms -- supervised, self-supervised, and manifold learning -- can\nall be studied from such a perspective. We also prove that the representations\nthat learn the contexture are optimal on those tasks that are compatible with\nthe context. One important implication of the contexture theory is that once\nthe model is large enough to approximate the top singular functions, further\nscaling up the model size yields diminishing returns. Therefore, scaling is not\nall we need, and further improvement requires better contexts. To this end, we\nstudy how to evaluate the usefulness of a context without knowing the\ndownstream tasks.

However, AVER remains challenging due to the\ninherent ambiguity of emotional expressions, cross-modal expressive\ndisparities, and the scarcity of reliably annotated data. Recent\nself-supervised AVER approaches have introduced strong multimodal\nrepresentations, yet they predominantly rely on modality-specific encoders and\ncoarse content-level alignment, limiting fine-grained emotional semantic\nmodeling. To address these issues, we propose VAEmo, an efficient two-stage\nframework for emotion-centric joint VA representation learning with external\nknowledge injection. In Stage 1, a unified and lightweight representation\nnetwork is pre-trained on large-scale speaker-centric VA corpora via masked\nreconstruction and contrastive objectives, mitigating the modality gap and\nlearning expressive, complementary representations without emotion labels. In\nStage 2, multimodal large language models automatically generate detailed\naffective descriptions according to our well-designed chain-of-thought\nprompting for only a small subset of VA samples; these rich textual semantics\nare then injected by aligning their corresponding embeddings with VA\nrepresentations through dual-path contrastive learning, further bridging the\nemotion gap.

Recent efforts attempt to improve editing\nmodels through generating higher-quality edited images, pre-training on\nrecognition tasks, or introducing vision-language models (VLMs) but fail to\nresolve this fundamental issue. In this paper, we offer a novel solution by\nconstructing more effective editing instructions for given image pairs. This\nincludes rectifying the editing instructions to better align with the\noriginal-edited image pairs and using contrastive editing instructions to\nfurther enhance their effectiveness. Specifically, we find that editing models\nexhibit specific generation attributes at different inference steps,\nindependent of the text. Based on these prior attributes, we define a unified\nguide for VLMs to rectify editing instructions. However, there are some\nchallenging editing scenarios that cannot be resolved solely with rectified\ninstructions. To this end, we further construct contrastive supervision signals\nwith positive and negative instructions and introduce them into the model\ntraining using triplet loss, thereby further facilitating supervision\neffectiveness. Our method does not require the VLM modules or pre-training\ntasks used in previous work, offering a more direct and efficient way to\nprovide better supervision signals, and providing a novel, simple, and\neffective solution for instruction-based image editing.

In particular, a positive speed-up can already be observed for\nconstant $k$, the only setting for which polynomial runtimes can be witnessed.\nOverall, this result supports the use of non-elitist selection schemes, but\nsuggests that aging-based mechanisms can be considerably more powerful than\nstochastic selection mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8001\u5316\u7684\u975e\u7cbe\u82f1\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u91cf\u65e0\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u8d2a\u5a6a\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u800c\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u867d\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8001\u5316\u7684\u975e\u7cbe\u82f1\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8c41\u514d\u5e74\u8f7b\u4e2a\u4f53\u88ab\u79fb\u9664\u3002", "result": "\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u56e0\u5b50\u4e3amax{1,\u0398(k)^{k-1}}\uff0c\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5e38\u6570k\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8001\u5316\u673a\u5236\u6bd4\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u975e\u7cbe\u82f1\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3002"}}

We address these\nchallenges by introducing RobSurv, a robust deep-learning framework that\nleverages vector quantization for resilient multi-modal feature learning. The\nkey innovation of our approach lies in its dual-path architecture: one path\nmaps continuous imaging features to learned discrete codebooks for\nnoise-resistant representation, while the parallel path preserves fine-grained\ndetails through continuous feature processing. This dual representation is\nintegrated through a novel patch-wise fusion mechanism that maintains local\nspatial relationships while capturing global context via Transformer-based\nprocessing.

In this paper, we first present\na general framework for rate-limited closed-loop distributed ISAC systems, and\nthen propose an autoencoder-based observation compression method to overcome\nthe constraints imposed by limited transmission capacity. Building on this\nframework, we conduct a case study using a closed-loop linear quadratic\nregulator (LQR) system to analyze how the interplay among observation,\ncompression, and state dimensions affects reconstruction accuracy, state\nestimation error, and control performance. In multi-sensor scenarios, our\nresults further show that optimal resource allocation initially prioritizes\nlow-noise sensors until the compression becomes lossless, after which resources\nare reallocated to high-noise sensors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u538b\u7f29\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u901f\u7387\u53d7\u9650\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u4f20\u8f93\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u95ed\u73afLQR\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4f18\u5148\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u538b\u7f29\u65e0\u635f\u540e\u518d\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u4f20\u8f93\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, anomaly\nclassification-distinguishing different types of anomalies-remains largely\nunexplored despite its critical importance in real-world inspection tasks. To\naddress this gap, we propose VELM, a novel LLM-based pipeline for anomaly\nclassification. Given the critical importance of inference speed, we first\napply an unsupervised anomaly detection method as a vision expert to assess the\nnormality of an observation. If an anomaly is detected, the LLM then classifies\nits type. A key challenge in developing and evaluating anomaly classification\nmodels is the lack of precise annotations of anomaly classes in existing\ndatasets. To address this limitation, we introduce MVTec-AC and VisA-AC,\nrefined versions of the widely used MVTec-AD and VisA datasets, which include\naccurate anomaly class labels for rigorous evaluation. Our approach achieves a\nstate-of-the-art anomaly classification accuracy of 80.4% on MVTec-AD,\nexceeding the prior baselines by 5%, and 84% on MVTec-AC, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of VELM in understanding and categorizing anomalies.

Monocular\ndepth estimation can be divided into two main directions: (1) relative depth\nestimation, which provides normalized or inverse depth without scale\ninformation, and (2) metric depth estimation, which involves recovering depth\nwith absolute scale. To obtain absolute scale information for practical\ndownstream tasks, utilizing textual information to recover the scale of a\nrelative depth map is a highly promising approach. However, since a single\nimage can have multiple descriptions from different perspectives or with\nvarying styles, it has been shown that different textual descriptions can\nsignificantly affect the scale recovery process. To address this issue, our\nmethod, VGLD, stabilizes the influence of textual information by incorporating\nhigh-level semantic information from the corresponding image alongside the\ntextual description. This approach resolves textual ambiguities and robustly\noutputs a set of linear transformation parameters (scalars) that can be\nglobally applied to the relative depth map, ultimately generating depth\npredictions with metric-scale accuracy. We validate our method across several\npopular relative depth models(MiDas, DepthAnything), using both indoor scenes\n(NYUv2) and outdoor scenes (KITTI). Our results demonstrate that VGLD functions\nas a universal alignment module when trained on multiple datasets, achieving\nstrong performance even in zero-shot scenarios.

We evaluate\nSLM-SAM 2 on three public datasets covering organs, bones, and muscles across\nMRI and CT modalities.

In this work, we\nsimulate manual errors in the form of adversarial attacks on the U-Net model\nand study the robustness of the model to human errors in annotation. Our\nresults indicate that U-Net can tolerate a certain level of corruption before\nits performance drops significantly. This finding highlights the crucial role\nthat the quality of manual annotations plays in determining the effectiveness\nof the segmentation model. The code and the new dataset, along with adversarial\nexamples for robust training, are publicly available.

The FeTA Challenge 2024 advanced\nautomated fetal brain MRI analysis by introducing biometry prediction as a new\ntask alongside tissue segmentation. For the first time, our diverse\nmulti-centric test set included data from a new low-field (0.55T) MRI dataset.\nEvaluation metrics were also expanded to include the topology-specific Euler\ncharacteristic difference (ED). Sixteen teams submitted segmentation methods,\nmost of which performed consistently across both high- and low-field scans.\nHowever, longitudinal trends indicate that segmentation accuracy may be\nreaching a plateau, with results now approaching inter-rater variability. The\nED metric uncovered topological differences that were missed by conventional\nmetrics, while the low-field dataset achieved the highest segmentation scores,\nhighlighting the potential of affordable imaging systems when paired with\nhigh-quality reconstruction. Seven teams participated in the biometry task, but\nmost methods failed to outperform a simple baseline that predicted measurements\nbased solely on gestational age, underscoring the challenge of extracting\nreliable biometric estimates from image data alone. Domain shift analysis\nidentified image quality as the most significant factor affecting model\ngeneralization, with super-resolution pipelines also playing a substantial\nrole.

This paper proposes a Dynamic Pooling Network (DPNet) for tiny\nobject detection to mitigate these issues. DPNet employs a flexible\ndown-sampling strategy by introducing a factor (df) to relax the fixed\ndownsampling process of the feature map to an adjustable one. Furthermore, we\ndesign a lightweight predictor to predict df for each input image, which is\nused to decrease the resolution of feature maps in the backbone. Thus, we\nachieve input-aware downsampling. We also design an Adaptive Normalization\nModule (ANM) to make a unified detector compatible with different dfs. A\nguidance loss supervises the predictor's training. DPNet dynamically allocates\ncomputing resources to trade off between detection accuracy and efficiency.\nExperiments on the TinyCOCO and TinyPerson datasets show that DPNet can save\nover 35% and 25% GFLOPs, respectively, while maintaining comparable detection\nperformance.

In this paper, we first assess GPT-4's\nability to act as a path planner compared to the A* algorithm, then present a\nhybrid planning framework that integrates GPT-4's semantic reasoning with A* on\na low-cost robot platform operating on ROS2 Humble. Our approach eliminates\nexplicit finite state machine (FSM) coding by using prompt-based GPT-4\nreasoning to handle task logic while maintaining the accurate paths computed by\nA*. The GPT-4 module provides semantic understanding of instructions and\nenvironmental cues (e.g., recognizing toxic obstacles or crowded areas to\navoid, or understanding low-battery situations requiring alternate route\nselection), and dynamically adjusts the robot's occupancy grid via obstacle\nbuffering to enforce semantic constraints. We demonstrate multi-step reasoning\nfor sequential tasks, such as first navigating to a resource goal and then\nreaching a final destination safely.

However, existing methods face several challenges.\nLearning-based approaches depend on small-scale indoor datasets, limiting the\nscene diversity and layout complexity. While large language models (LLMs) can\nleverage diverse text-domain knowledge, they struggle with spatial realism,\noften producing unnatural object placements that fail to respect common sense.\nOur key insight is that vision perception can bridge this gap by providing\nrealistic spatial guidance that LLMs lack. To this end, we introduce\nScenethesis, a training-free agentic framework that integrates LLM-based scene\nplanning with vision-guided layout refinement.

However, a notable side effect of preference alignment\nis poor calibration: while the pre-trained models are typically\nwell-calibrated, LLMs tend to become poorly calibrated after alignment with\nhuman preferences. In this paper, we investigate why preference alignment\naffects calibration and how to address this issue. For the first question, we\nobserve that the preference collapse issue in alignment undesirably generalizes\nto the calibration scenario, causing LLMs to exhibit overconfidence and poor\ncalibration. To address this, we demonstrate the importance of fine-tuning with\ndomain-specific knowledge to alleviate the overconfidence issue. To further\nanalyze whether this affects the model's performance, we categorize models into\ntwo regimes: calibratable and non-calibratable, defined by bounds of Expected\nCalibration Error (ECE). In the calibratable regime, we propose a\ncalibration-aware fine-tuning approach to achieve proper calibration without\ncompromising LLMs' performance. However, as models are further fine-tuned for\nbetter performance, they enter the non-calibratable regime.

IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering\n  (ICDE'2025), accepted", "summary": "Graph In-Context Learning, with the ability to adapt pre-trained graph models\nto novel and diverse downstream graphs without updating any parameters, has\ngained much attention in the community. The key to graph in-context learning is\nto perform downstream graphs conditioned on chosen prompt examples. Existing\nmethods randomly select subgraphs or edges as prompts, leading to noisy graph\nprompts and inferior model performance. Additionally, due to the gap between\npre-training and testing graphs, when the number of classes in the testing\ngraphs is much greater than that in the training, the in-context learning\nability will also significantly deteriorate. To tackle the aforementioned\nchallenges, we develop a multi-stage adaptive prompt optimization method\nGraphPrompter, which optimizes the entire process of generating, selecting, and\nusing graph prompts for better in-context learning capabilities. Firstly,\nPrompt Generator introduces a reconstruction layer to highlight the most\ninformative edges and reduce irrelevant noise for graph prompt construction.\nFurthermore, in the selection stage, Prompt Selector employs the $k$-nearest\nneighbors algorithm and pre-trained selection layers to dynamically choose\nappropriate samples and minimize the influence of irrelevant prompts. Finally,\nwe leverage a Prompt Augmenter with a cache replacement strategy to enhance the\ngeneralization capability of the pre-trained model on new datasets.

The generalizability of extant methods is frequently\ncompromised due to the pronounced variability in imaging and the heterogeneous\ncharacteristics of pancreatic lesions, which may mimic normal tissues and\nexhibit significant inter-patient variability. Thus, we propose a\ngeneralization framework that synergizes pixel-level classification and\nregression tasks, to accurately delineate lesions and improve model stability.\nThis framework not only seeks to align segmentation contours with actual\nlesions but also uses regression to elucidate spatial relationships between\ndiseased and normal tissues, thereby improving tumor localization and\nmorphological characterization. Enhanced by the reciprocal transformation of\ntask outputs, our approach integrates additional regression supervision within\nthe segmentation context, bolstering the model's generalization ability from a\ndual-task perspective. Besides, dual self-supervised learning in feature spaces\nand output spaces augments the model's representational capability and\nstability across different imaging views. Experiments on 594 samples composed\nof three datasets with significant imaging differences demonstrate that our\ngeneralized pancreas segmentation results comparable to mainstream in-domain\nvalidation performance (Dice: 84.07%).

However, such systems are\nfundamentally governed by the Point Spread Function (PSF), which dictates how a\npoint source contributes to the final captured signal. Traditional lensless\ntechniques often require explicit calibrations and extensive pre-processing,\nrelying on static or approximate PSF models. These rigid strategies can result\nin limited adaptability to real-world challenges, including noise, system\nimperfections, and dynamic scene variations, thus impeding high-fidelity\nreconstruction. In this paper, we propose LensNet, an end-to-end deep learning\nframework that integrates spatial-domain and frequency-domain representations\nin a unified pipeline. Central to our approach is a learnable Coded Mask\nSimulator (CMS) that enables dynamic, data-driven estimation of the PSF during\ntraining, effectively mitigating the shortcomings of fixed or sparsely\ncalibrated kernels. By embedding a Wiener filtering component, LensNet refines\nglobal structure and restores fine-scale details, thus alleviating the\ndependency on multiple handcrafted pre-processing steps.

SHD integrates hierarchical fusion and group\nattention mechanisms to achieve adaptive feature fusion while retaining local\nstructural smoothness. Meanwhile, a target-aware feature aggregation (TFA)\nmodule is used to enhance pathological regions and reduce artifacts.\nExperimental results on multiple fundus image datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness and generalizability of MTRL-FIE for fundus image enhancement.\nCompared to state-of-the-art methods, MTRL-FIE achieves superior enhancement\nperformance with a more lightweight architecture.

The proposed approach adopts the\nfollowing strategies to reduce the cost: (1) adding intersection links between\ntwo indexing nodes, which can better reduce query processing costs while\ncontrolling the number of nodes of the graph index; (2) intersection links are\nadded between two nodes according to the probabilistic distribution calculated\nfor estimating the costs of adding intersection between two nodes; (3)\ncoordinates at one dimension having more resources are split by coordinates at\nanother dimension to balance the number of resources hold by indexing nodes;\nand, (4) short-cut links are added between sibling coordinates of coordinate\ntrees to make an efficient query on linear order coordinates. Analysis and\nexperiments verified the effectiveness of the generated index in supporting\nsubspace aggregation query.

A dynamic weighting mechanism adapts component\ncontributions based on image characteristics like brightness and variance,\nenhancing flexibility across distortion types. Our contributions include a\nunified metric and dynamic weighting for better perceptual alignment. Evaluated\non TID2013 and LIVE datasets, HIRQM achieves Pearson and Spearman correlations\nof 0.92 and 0.90, outperforming traditional metrics.

Recent studies utilize\nadvanced neural networks, ranging from convolutional and recurrent models to\nTransformer-based models, to capture contextual information of gene sequence,\nwith the primary goal of obtaining effective gene sequence representations and\nthus enhance the models' understanding of various running gene samples.\nHowever, these approaches often directly apply language modeling techniques to\ngene sequences and do not fully consider the intrinsic information organization\nin them, where they do not consider how units at different granularities\ncontribute to representation. In this paper, we propose DNAZEN, an enhanced\ngenomic representation framework designed to learn from various granularities\nin gene sequences, including small polymers and G-grams that are combinations\nof several contiguous polymers. Specifically, we extract the G-grams from\nlarge-scale genomic corpora through an unsupervised approach to construct the\nG-gram vocabulary, which is used to provide G-grams in the learning process of\nDNA sequences through dynamically matching from running gene samples.

This paper presents a machine learning approach for\napproximating the signed distance function (SDF) of a point cloud using sparse\nellipsoidal radial basis function networks, enabling a compact and accurate\nsurface representation. Given the SDF values defined on the grid points\nconstructed from the point cloud, our method approximates the SDF accurately\nwith as few ellipsoidal radial basis functions (ERBFs) as possible, i.e.,\nrepresent the SDF of a point cloud by sparse ERBFs. To balance sparsity and\napproximation precision, a dynamic multi-objective optimization strategy is\nintroduced, which adaptively adds the regularization terms and jointly\noptimizes the weights, centers, shapes, and orientations of ERBFs. To improve\ncomputational efficiency, a nearest-neighbor-based data structure is employed,\nrestricting function calculations to points near each Gaussian kernel center.\nThe computations for each kernel are further parallelized on CUDA, which\nsignificantly improves the optimization speed. Additionally, a hierarchical\noctree-based refinement strategy is designed for training. Specifically, the\ninitialization and optimization of network parameters are conducted using\ncoarse grid points in the octree lattice structure.

While prior approaches such as iterative\nreward-ranked fine-tuning (RAFT) have relied on such formulations, they\ntypically apply uniform inference budgets across prompts, which fails to\naccount for variability in difficulty and convergence behavior. This work\nidentifies the main bottleneck in CoT training as inefficient stochastic\ngradient estimation due to static sampling strategies.

The\nmethod dynamically allocates computational resources by monitoring prompt\nacceptance rates and stochastic gradient norms, ensuring that the resulting\ngradient variance is minimized.

In this work, we first categorize time series captions\ninto three levels: point-level, fragment-level, and instance-level.\nAdditionally, we introduce a new fragment-level dataset containing over 600,000\nhigh-resolution time series-text pairs.

As each newly produced token is appended to the partial\noutput sequence, the length grows and so does the memory and compute load, due\nto the expanding key-value caches, which store intermediate representations of\nall previously generated tokens in the multi-head attention (MHA) layer. As\nthis iterative process steadily increases memory and compute demands,\nlayer-based partitioning in resource-constrained edge environments often\nresults in memory overload or high inference latency.

Notably, they can\napproach these problems in a zero or few-shot manner, thereby eliminating the\nneed for training or fine-tuning task-specific models. However, LLMs face some\nchallenges, including hallucination and the presence of outdated knowledge or\nmissing information from specific domains in the training data. These problems\ncannot be easily solved by retraining the models with new data as it is a\ntime-consuming and expensive process. To mitigate these issues, Knowledge\nGraphs (KGs) have been proposed as a structured external source of information\nto enrich LLMs. With this idea, in this work we use KGs to enhance LLMs for\nzero-shot Entity Disambiguation (ED).

The immense\nscale of WSIs, often exceeding 100,000 X 100,000 pixels, clashes with the\nlimited views traditional monitors offer. This mismatch forces constant panning\nand zooming, increasing pathologist cognitive load, causing diagnostic fatigue,\nand slowing pathologists' adoption of digital methods. PathVis, our\nmixed-reality visualization platform for Apple Vision Pro, addresses these\nchallenges. It transforms the pathologist's interaction with data, replacing\ncumbersome mouse-and-monitor navigation with intuitive exploration using\nnatural hand gestures, eye gaze, and voice commands in an immersive workspace.\nPathVis integrates AI to enhance diagnosis.

Additionally, a multimodal conversational AI assistant offers\nreal-time image interpretation support and aids collaboration among\npathologists across multiple Apple devices. By merging the directness of\ntraditional pathology with advanced mixed-reality visualization and AI, PathVis\nimproves diagnostic workflows, reduces cognitive strain, and makes pathology\npractice more effective and engaging.

Due to immense parameter sizes, fine-tuning these models with private\ndata for diverse downstream tasks has become mainstream. Though federated\nlearning (FL) offers a promising solution for fine-tuning LLMs without sharing\nraw data, substantial computing costs hinder its democratization. Moreover, in\nreal-world scenarios, private client devices often possess heterogeneous\ncomputing resources, further complicating LLM fine-tuning. To combat these\nchallenges, we propose HSplitLoRA, a heterogeneous parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning (PEFT) framework built on split learning (SL) and low-rank\nadaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, for efficiently fine-tuning LLMs on\nheterogeneous client devices. HSplitLoRA first identifies important weights\nbased on their contributions to LLM training. It then dynamically configures\nthe decomposition ranks of LoRA adapters for selected weights and determines\nthe model split point according to varying computing budgets of client devices.\nFinally, a noise-free adapter aggregation mechanism is devised to support\nheterogeneous adapter aggregation without introducing noise.
