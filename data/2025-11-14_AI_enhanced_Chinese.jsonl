However, many existing approaches primarily focus on feature space consistency and classification personalization during local training, often neglecting the local adaptability of the extractor and the global generalization of the classifier. This oversight results in insufficient coordination and weak coupling between the components, ultimately degrading the overall model performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedeCouple, a federated learning method that balances global generalization and local adaptability at a fine-grained level. Our approach jointly learns global and local feature representations while employing dynamic knowledge distillation to enhance the generalization of personalized classifiers. We further introduce anchors to refine the feature space; their strict locality and non-transmission inherently preserve privacy and reduce communication overhead. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis proving that FedeCouple converges for nonconvex objectives, with iterates approaching a stationary point as the number of communication rounds increases. Extensive experiments conducted on five image-classification datasets demonstrate that FedeCouple consistently outperforms nine baseline methods in effectiveness, stability, scalability, and security. Notably, in experiments evaluating effectiveness, FedeCouple surpasses the best baseline by a significant margin of 4.3%.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedeCouple\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5e73\u8861\u5168\u5c40\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u589e\u5f3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u951a\u70b9\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u5c40\u90e8\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5168\u5c40\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u7ec4\u4ef6\u95f4\u534f\u8c03\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5177\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u975e\u4f20\u8f93\u6027\u7684\u951a\u70b9\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFedeCouple\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e5d\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u9ad8\u51fa4.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "FedeCouple\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u5168\u5c40\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

To systematically analyze this issue, we propose ParaBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate both text and image output modalities. Our analysis using ParaBench reveals that this performance degradation is strongly correlated with poor alignment between the generated reasoning and the final image. To resolve this, we propose a parallel multimodal diffusion framework, MMaDA-Parallel, that enables continuous, bidirectional interaction between text and images throughout the entire denoising trajectory. MMaDA-Parallel is trained with supervised finetuning and then further optimized by Parallel Reinforcement Learning (ParaRL), a novel strategy that applies semantic rewards along the trajectory to enforce cross-modal consistency. Experiments validate that our model significantly improves cross-modal alignment and semantic consistency, achieving a 6.9\\% improvement in Output Alignment on ParaBench compared to the state-of-the-art model, Bagel, establishing a more robust paradigm for thinking-aware image synthesis.

Across four benchmark datasets, ChimpACT, BaboonLand, PanAf500, and ChimpBehave, our approach consistently outperforms prior work, including fully finetuned baselines, and scales favorably with fewer labels.

It occurs on a continuum from mild to severe, and treatment options can vary based on severity. Assessment of severity involves a clinician's expert judgment, which is costly and can vary widely in reliability. In this work, we present the first method for automatically classifying phonotrauma severity from vocal fold images. To account for the ordinal nature of the labels, we adopt a widely used ordinal regression framework. To account for label uncertainty, we propose a novel modification to ordinal regression loss functions that enables them to operate on soft labels reflecting annotator rating distributions. Our proposed soft ordinal regression method achieves predictive performance approaching that of clinical experts, while producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates.

However, these models apply each instruction in the prompt with a fixed strength, limiting the user's ability to precisely and continuously control the intensity of individual edits. We introduce SliderEdit, a framework for continuous image editing with fine-grained, interpretable instruction control. Given a multi-part edit instruction, SliderEdit disentangles the individual instructions and exposes each as a globally trained slider, allowing smooth adjustment of its strength. Unlike prior works that introduced slider-based attribute controls in text-to-image generation, typically requiring separate training or fine-tuning for each attribute or concept, our method learns a single set of low-rank adaptation matrices that generalize across diverse edits, attributes, and compositional instructions. This enables continuous interpolation along individual edit dimensions while preserving both spatial locality and global semantic consistency. We apply SliderEdit to state-of-the-art image editing models, including FLUX-Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit, and observe substantial improvements in edit controllability, visual consistency, and user steerability.

Deep learning models have recently achieved promising results by implicitly learning such patterns from 2D trajectory data. However, most approaches treat pedestrians as point entities, ignoring the physical space that each person occupies. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model that enhances the Social LSTM with a new Dynamic Occupied Space loss function. This loss function guides Social LSTM in learning to avoid realistic collisions without increasing displacement error across different crowd densities, ranging from low to high, in both homogeneous and heterogeneous density settings. Such a function achieves this by combining the average displacement error with a new collision penalty that is sensitive to scene density and individual spatial occupancy. For efficient training and evaluation, five datasets were generated from real pedestrian trajectories recorded during the Festival of Lights in Lyon 2022. Four datasets represent homogeneous crowd conditions -- low, medium, high, and very high density -- while the fifth corresponds to a heterogeneous density distribution. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed model not only lowers collision rates but also enhances displacement prediction accuracy in each dataset. Specifically, the model achieves up to a 31% reduction in the collision rate and reduces the average displacement error and the final displacement error by 5% and 6%, respectively, on average across all datasets compared to the baseline.

It remains unclear how pre-training domain (medical vs. general), paradigm (e.g., text-guided), and architecture influence embedding quality, hindering the selection of optimal encoders for specific radiology tasks. To address this, we evaluate vision encoders from eight medical and general-domain FMs for chest X-ray analysis. We benchmark classification (pneumothorax, cardiomegaly) and segmentation (pneumothorax, cardiac boundary) using linear probing and fine-tuning. Our results show that domain-specific pre-training provides a significant advantage; medical FMs consistently outperformed general-domain models in linear probing, establishing superior initial feature quality. However, feature utility is highly task-dependent. Pre-trained embeddings were strong for global classification and segmenting salient anatomy (e.g., heart). In contrast, for segmenting complex, subtle pathologies (e.g., pneumothorax), all FMs performed poorly without significant fine-tuning, revealing a critical gap in localizing subtle disease. Subgroup analysis showed FMs use confounding shortcuts (e.g., chest tubes for pneumothorax) for classification, a strategy that fails for precise segmentation. We also found that expensive text-image alignment is not a prerequisite; image-only (RAD-DINO) and label-supervised (Ark+) FMs were among top performers. Notably, a supervised, end-to-end baseline remained highly competitive, matching or exceeding the best FMs on segmentation tasks. These findings show that while medical pre-training is beneficial, architectural choices (e.g., multi-scale) are critical, and pre-trained features are not universally effective, especially for complex localization tasks where supervised models remain a strong alternative.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u533b\u5b66\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u7279\u5f81\u6709\u6548\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u75c5\u7406\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u5f81\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u662f\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9886\u57df\u3001\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f308\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff08\u6c14\u80f8\u3001\u5fc3\u810f\u80a5\u5927\uff09\u548c\u5206\u5272\uff08\u6c14\u80f8\u3001\u5fc3\u810f\u8fb9\u754c\uff09\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u533b\u5b66\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u533b\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u663e\u8457\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u75c5\u7406\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u6dc6\u6377\u5f84\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff1b\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u533b\u5b66\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u76ca\uff0c\u4f46\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\uff08\u5982\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff09\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u975e\u666e\u904d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u662f\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Because of the rich texture of iris images, which spans a wide range of spatial frequencies, synthesizing same-identity iris images while controlling specific attributes remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a new iris image augmentation strategy by traversing a generative model's latent space toward latent codes that represent same-identity samples but with some desired iris image properties manipulated. The latent space traversal is guided by a gradient of specific geometrical, textural, or quality-related iris image features (e.g., sharpness, pupil size, iris size, or pupil-to-iris ratio) and preserves the identity represented by the image being manipulated. The proposed approach can be easily extended to manipulate any attribute for which a differentiable loss term can be formulated.

For this reason, episodic test-time adaptation strategies have recently emerged as powerful techniques for adapting VLMs to a single unlabeled image. However, existing adaptation strategies, such as test-time prompt tuning, typically require backpropagating through large encoder weights or altering core model components. In this work, we introduce Spectrum-Aware Test-Time Steering (STS), a lightweight adaptation framework that extracts a spectral subspace from the textual embeddings to define principal semantic directions and learns to steer latent representations in a spectrum-aware manner by adapting a small number of per-sample shift parameters to minimize entropy across augmented views. STS operates entirely at inference in the latent space, without backpropagation through or modification of the frozen encoders. Building on standard evaluation protocols, our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that STS largely surpasses or compares favorably against state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods, while introducing only a handful of additional parameters and achieving inference speeds up to 8x faster with a 12x smaller memory footprint than conventional test-time prompt tuning.

Trained once on a single dataset, Lumos3D performs inference in a purely feed- forward manner, directly restoring illumination and structure from unposed, low-light multi-view images without any per- scene training or optimization. Built upon a geometry-grounded backbone, Lumos3D reconstructs a normal-light 3D Gaussian representation that restores illumination while faithfully pre- serving structural details. During training, a cross-illumination distillation scheme is employed, where the teacher network is distilled on normal-light ground truth to transfer accurate geometric information, such as depth, to the student model. A dedicated Lumos loss is further introduced to promote photomet- ric consistency within the reconstructed 3D space. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that Lumos3D achieves high- fidelity low-light 3D scene restoration with accurate geometry and strong generalization to unseen cases. Furthermore, the framework naturally extends to handle over-exposure correction, highlighting its versatility for diverse lighting restoration tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Lumos3D\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u7684\u901a\u7528\u53163D\u4f4e\u5149\u573a\u666f\u6062\u590d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u65e0\u4f4d\u59ff\u7684\u4f4e\u5149\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u76f4\u63a5\u6062\u590d\u5149\u7167\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9010\u573a\u666f\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u548c\u573a\u666f\u7279\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u91cd\u5efa\u6b63\u5e38\u5149\u7167\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u5149\u7167\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u4e13\u95e8\u7684Lumos\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u4f4e\u51493D\u573a\u666f\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u81ea\u7136\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8fc7\u66dd\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5149\u7167\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present a simple yet effective cross-view image retrieval framework that leverages a pretrained vision encoder and a large language model (LLM), requiring no additional training. Given a monocular street-view image, our method extracts geographic cues through web-based image search and LLM-based location inference, generates a satellite query via geocoding API, and retrieves matching tiles using a pretrained vision encoder (e.g., DINOv2) with PCA-based whitening feature refinement. Despite using no ground-truth supervision or finetuning, our proposed method outperforms prior learning-based approaches on the benchmark dataset under zero-shot settings. Moreover, our pipeline enables automatic construction of semantically aligned street-to-satellite datasets, which is offering a scalable and cost-efficient alternative to manual annotation.

Unlike existing animation pipelines that use meshes or point clouds as the underlying 3D representation, our approach introduces the use of 3DGS as the 3D representation to the problem of animating humans in scenes. By representing humans and scenes as Gaussians, our approach allows for geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of humans interacting with 3D scenes. Our key insight is that the rendering can be decoupled from the motion synthesis and each sub-problem can be addressed independently, without the need for paired human-scene data. Central to our method is a Gaussian-aligned motion module that synthesizes motion without explicit scene geometry, using opacity-based cues and projected Gaussian structures to guide human placement and pose alignment. To ensure natural interactions, we further propose a human-scene Gaussian refinement optimization that enforces realistic contact and navigation. We evaluate our approach on scenes from Scannet++ and the SuperSplat library, and on avatars reconstructed from sparse and dense multi-view human capture.

Major space weather contributors are the solar wind and coronal mass ejections whose variable density, speed, temperature, and magnetic field make the automated classification of those structures challenging. In this work, we adapt a foundation model for solar physics, originally trained on Solar Dynamics Observatory imagery, to create embeddings suitable for solar wind structure analysis. These embeddings are concatenated with the spacecraft position and solar magnetic connectivity encoded using Fourier features which generates a neural field-based model. The full deep learning architecture is fine-tuned bridging the gap between remote sensing and in situ observations. Labels are derived from Parker Solar Probe measurements, forming a downstream classification task that maps plasma properties to solar wind structures.

However, they still face critical challenges in modeling long-range dependencies under the usage of Rotary Positional Encoding (ROPE). Although it can facilitate precise modeling of token positions, it induces progressive attention decay as token distance increases, especially with progressive attention decay over distant token pairs, which severely impairs the model's ability to remember global context. To alleviate this issue, we propose inference-only Three-step Decay Resilience Strategies (T-DRS), comprising (1) Semantic-Driven DRS (SD-DRS), amplifying semantically meaningful but distant signals via content-aware residuals, (2) Distance-aware Control DRS (DC-DRS), which can purify attention by smoothly modulating weights based on positional distances, suppressing noise while preserving locality, and (3) re-Reinforce Distant DRS (reRD-DRS), consolidating the remaining informative remote dependencies to maintain global coherence. Together, the T-DRS recover suppressed long-range token pairs without harming local inductive biases. Extensive experiments on Vision Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks demonstrate that T-DRS can consistently improve performance in a training-free manner.

Some researchers have attempted to directly apply the foundation model to the RGB-D video salient object detection (RGB-D VSOD) task, which often encounters three challenges, including the dependence on manual prompts, the high memory consumption of sequential adapters, and the computational burden of memory attention. To address the limitations, we propose a novel method, namely Segment Anything Model with Depth-guided Adaptive Queries (SAM-DAQ), which adapts SAM2 to pop-out salient objects from videos by seamlessly integrating depth and temporal cues within a unified framework. Firstly, we deploy a parallel adapter-based multi-modal image encoder (PAMIE), which incorporates several depth-guided parallel adapters (DPAs) in a skip-connection way. Remarkably, we fine-tune the frozen SAM encoder under prompt-free conditions, where the DPA utilizes depth cues to facilitate the fusion of multi-modal features. Secondly, we deploy a query-driven temporal memory (QTM) module, which unifies the memory bank and prompt embeddings into a learnable pipeline. Concretely, by leveraging both frame-level queries and video-level queries simultaneously, the QTM module can not only selectively extract temporal consistency features but also iteratively update the temporal representations of the queries.

Subsequently, the point-wise feature of the point cloud is progressively restored through multiple stages of the RWKV Point Deconvolution (RWKV-PD) modules. By leveraging a compact and efficient design, our method achieves a lightweight model representation. Experimental results demonstrate that RWKV-PCSSC reduces the parameter count by 4.18$\\times$ and improves memory efficiency by 1.37$\\times$ compared to state-of-the-art methods PointSSC. Furthermore, our network achieves state-of-the-art performance on established indoor (SSC-PC, NYUCAD-PC) and outdoor (PointSSC) scene dataset, as well as on our proposed datasets (NYUCAD-PC-V2, 3D-FRONT-PC).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRWKV-PCSSC\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eRWKV\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u70b9\u4e91\u8bed\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u8865\u5168\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u8865\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u5bc6\u96c6\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u591a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u8f7b\u91cf\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165RWKV\u79cd\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6a21\u5757\u4ece\u90e8\u5206\u70b9\u4e91\u805a\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u751f\u6210\u7c97\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5RWKV\u70b9\u53cd\u5377\u79ef\u6a21\u5757\u9010\u6b65\u6062\u590d\u70b9\u4e91\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7d27\u51d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5PointSSC\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c114.18\u500d\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u53471.37\u500d\uff0c\u5728\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RWKV-PCSSC\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u8865\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Current 3D-VLMs directly embed the 3D point clouds into 3D tokens, following large 2D-VLMs with powerful reasoning capabilities. However, this framework has a great computational cost limiting its application, where we identify that the bottleneck lies in processing all 3D tokens in the Large Language Model (LLM) part. This raises the question: how can we reduce the computational overhead introduced by 3D tokens while preserving the integrity of their essential information? To address this question, we introduce Hierarchical Compensatory Compression (HCC-3D) to efficiently compress 3D tokens while maintaining critical detail retention. Specifically, we first propose a global structure compression (GSC), in which we design global queries to compress all 3D tokens into a few key tokens while keeping overall structural information. Then, to compensate for the information loss in GSC, we further propose an adaptive detail mining (ADM) module that selectively recompresses salient but under-attended features through complementary scoring.

One key reason is that tiny objects carry limited features that are inevitably degraded or lost during long-distance network propagation.

To tackle these issues, we propose a Scale-Aware Relay Layer (SARL) and a Scale-Adaptive Loss (SAL) for tiny object detection, both of which are seamlessly compatible with the top-performing frameworks. Specifically, SARL employs a cross-scale spatial-channel attention to progressively enrich the meaningful features of each layer and strengthen the cross-layer feature sharing. SAL reshapes the vanilla IoU-based losses so as to dynamically assign lower weights to larger objects. This loss is able to focus training on tiny objects while reducing the influence on large objects.

Existing methods for Single-DGOD typically rely on discrete data augmentation or static perturbation methods to expand data diversity, thereby mitigating the lack of access to target domain data. However, in real-world scenarios such as changes in weather or lighting conditions, domain shifts often occur continuously and gradually. Discrete augmentations and static perturbations fail to effectively capture the dynamic variation of feature distributions, thereby limiting the model's ability to perceive fine-grained cross-domain differences. To this end, we propose a new method, Liquid Temporal Feature Evolution, which simulates the progressive evolution of features from the source domain to simulated latent distributions by incorporating temporal modeling and liquid neural network-driven parameter adjustment. Specifically, we introduce controllable Gaussian noise injection and multi-scale Gaussian blurring to simulate initial feature perturbations, followed by temporal modeling and a liquid parameter adjustment mechanism to generate adaptive modulation parameters, enabling a smooth and continuous adaptation across domains. By capturing progressive cross-domain feature evolution and dynamically regulating adaptation paths, our method bridges the source-unknown domain distribution gap, significantly boosting generalization and robustness to unseen shifts. Significant performance improvements on the Diverse Weather dataset and Real-to-Art benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our method.

However, this approach is susceptible to distribution drift, caused by the sequential optimization of shared backbone parameters. This results in a mismatch between the distributions of the previously learned classes and that of the updater model, ultimately degrading the effectiveness of classifier performance over time. To address this issue, we introduce a latent space transition operator and propose Sequential Learning with Drift Compensation (SLDC). SLDC aims to align feature distributions across tasks to mitigate the impact of drift. First, we present a linear variant of SLDC, which learns a linear operator by solving a regularized least-squares problem that maps features before and after fine-tuning. Next, we extend this with a weakly nonlinear SLDC variant, which assumes that the ideal transition operator lies between purely linear and fully nonlinear transformations. This is implemented using learnable, weakly nonlinear mappings that balance flexibility and generalization. To further reduce representation drift, we apply knowledge distillation (KD) in both algorithmic variants. Extensive experiments on standard CIL benchmarks demonstrate that SLDC significantly improves the performance of SeqFT. Notably, by combining KD to address representation drift with SLDC to compensate distribution drift, SeqFT achieves performance comparable to joint training across all evaluated datasets.

However, advanced deep learning-based ReID models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations to pedestrian images can cause entirely incorrect predictions, posing significant security threats. Although numerous adversarial defense strategies have been proposed for classification tasks, their extension to metric learning tasks such as person ReID remains relatively unexplored. Moreover, the several existing defenses for person ReID fail to address the inherent unique challenges of adversarially robust ReID. In this paper, we systematically identify the challenges of adversarial defense in person ReID into two key issues: model bias and composite generalization requirements. To address them, we propose a debiased dual-invariant defense framework composed of two main phases. In the data balancing phase, we mitigate model bias using a diffusion-model-based data resampling strategy that promotes fairness and diversity in training data. In the bi-adversarial self-meta defense phase, we introduce a novel metric adversarial training approach incorporating farthest negative extension softening to overcome the robustness degradation caused by the absence of classifier.

While powerful, ViGs often face substantial computational challenges stemming from their graph construction phase, which can hinder their efficiency. To address this issue we propose AdaptViG, an efficient and powerful hybrid Vision GNN that introduces a novel graph construction mechanism called Adaptive Graph Convolution. This mechanism builds upon a highly efficient static axial scaffold and a dynamic, content-aware gating strategy called Exponential Decay Gating. This gating mechanism selectively weighs long-range connections based on feature similarity. Furthermore, AdaptViG employs a hybrid strategy, utilizing our efficient gating mechanism in the early stages and a full Global Attention block in the final stage for maximum feature aggregation.

However, their detection latency and tendency to hallucinate predictions render them unsuitable for direct deployment. This work introduces a novel pipeline that addresses this challenge by leveraging VLMs to automatically generate pseudo-labels for training efficient, real-time object detectors. Our key innovation is a per-object co-teaching-based training strategy that mitigates the inherent noise in VLM-generated labels. The proposed per-object coteaching approach filters noisy bounding boxes from training instead of filtering the entire image. Specifically, two YOLO models learn collaboratively, filtering out unreliable boxes from each mini-batch based on their peers' per-object loss values. Overall, our pipeline provides an efficient, robust, and scalable approach to train high-performance object detectors for autonomous driving, significantly reducing reliance on costly human annotation.

This paper aims to robustly fine-tune these vision-language models on in-distribution (ID) data without compromising their generalization abilities in out-of-distribution (OOD) and zero-shot settings. Current robust fine-tuning methods tackle this challenge by reusing contrastive learning, which was used in pre-training, for fine-tuning. However, we found that these methods distort the geometric structure of the embeddings, which plays a crucial role in the generalization of vision-language models, resulting in limited OOD and zero-shot performance. To address this, we propose Difference Vector Equalization (DiVE), which preserves the geometric structure during fine-tuning. The idea behind DiVE is to constrain difference vectors, each of which is obtained by subtracting the embeddings extracted from the pre-trained and fine-tuning models for the same data sample. By constraining the difference vectors to be equal across various data samples, we effectively preserve the geometric structure. Therefore, we introduce two losses: average vector loss (AVL) and pairwise vector loss (PVL). AVL preserves the geometric structure globally by constraining difference vectors to be equal to their weighted average. PVL preserves the geometric structure locally by ensuring a consistent multimodal alignment.

However, these systems remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that embed hidden malicious behaviors during training. A key limitation of existing backdoor attacks is their lack of physical realizability, primarily due to the digital-to-physical domain gap. Digital triggers often fail in real-world settings because they overlook material-dependent LiDAR reflection properties. On the other hand, physically constructed triggers are often unoptimized, leading to low effectiveness or easy detectability.This paper introduces Material-Oriented Backdoor Attack (MOBA), a novel framework that bridges the digital-physical gap by explicitly modeling the material properties of real-world triggers. MOBA tackles two key challenges in physical backdoor design: 1) robustness of the trigger material under diverse environmental conditions, 2) alignment between the physical trigger's behavior and its digital simulation. First, we propose a systematic approach to selecting robust trigger materials, identifying titanium dioxide (TiO_2) for its high diffuse reflectivity and environmental resilience. Second, to ensure the digital trigger accurately mimics the physical behavior of the material-based trigger, we develop a novel simulation pipeline that features: (1) an angle-independent approximation of the Oren-Nayar BRDF model to generate realistic LiDAR intensities, and (2) a distance-aware scaling mechanism to maintain spatial consistency across varying depths. We conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LiDAR-based and Camera-LiDAR fusion models, showing that MOBA achieves a 93.50% attack success rate, outperforming prior methods by over 41%.

Existing methods primarily rely on two forms of weak supervision: one-thing-one-click annotations and bounding box annotations, both of which aim to reduce labeling efforts. However, these approaches still encounter limitations, including labor-intensive annotation processes, high complexity, and reliance on expert annotators. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{DBGroup}, a two-stage weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation framework that leverages scene-level annotations as a more efficient and scalable alternative. In the first stage, we introduce a Dual-Branch Point Grouping module to generate pseudo labels guided by semantic and mask cues extracted from multi-view images. To further improve label quality, we develop two refinement strategies: Granularity-Aware Instance Merging and Semantic Selection and Propagation. The second stage involves multi-round self-training on an end-to-end instance segmentation network using the refined pseudo-labels. Additionally, we introduce an Instance Mask Filter strategy to address inconsistencies within the pseudo labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBGroup achieves competitive performance compared to sparse-point-level supervised 3D instance segmentation methods, while surpassing state-of-the-art scene-level supervised 3D semantic segmentation approaches.

Quantization algorithms compress Vision Transformers (ViTs) into low-bit formats, reducing memory and computation demands with minimal accuracy degradation. However, existing methods rely on uniform precision, ignoring the diverse sensitivity of ViT components to quantization. Metric-based Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) is a promising alternative, but previous MPQ methods for ViTs suffer from three major limitations: 1) coarse granularity, 2) mismatch in metric scale across component types, and 3) quantization-unaware bit allocation. In this paper, we propose LampQ (Layer-wise Mixed Precision Quantization for Vision Transformers), an accurate metric-based MPQ method for ViTs to overcome these limitations. LampQ performs layer-wise quantization to achieve both fine-grained control and efficient acceleration, incorporating a type-aware Fisher-based metric to measure sensitivity. Then, LampQ assigns bit-widths optimally through integer linear programming and further updates them iteratively.

Existing approaches often operate at the object level or disjointedly handle fine-grained affordance reasoning, lacking coherent, instruction-driven grounding and reasoning. In this work, we introduce a new task: Fine-grained 3D Embodied Reasoning, which requires an agent to predict, for each referenced affordance element in a 3D scene, a structured triplet comprising its spatial location, motion type, and motion axis, based on a task instruction. To solve this task, we propose AffordBot, a novel framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with a tailored chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paradigm. To bridge the gap between 3D input and 2D-compatible MLLMs, we render surround-view images of the scene and project 3D element candidates into these views, forming a rich visual representation aligned with the scene geometry. Our CoT pipeline begins with an active perception stage, prompting the MLLM to select the most informative viewpoint based on the instruction, before proceeding with step-by-step reasoning to localize affordance elements and infer plausible interaction motions. Evaluated on the SceneFun3D dataset, AffordBot achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating strong generalization and physically grounded reasoning with only 3D point cloud input and MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea63D\u5177\u8eab\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u6307\u4ee4\u9884\u6d4b3D\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f74\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86AffordBot\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728SceneFun3D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ea7\u522b\u64cd\u4f5c\u6216\u5206\u79bb\u5904\u7406\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAffordBot\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e32\u67d3\u73af\u7ed5\u89c6\u56fe\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u5c063D\u5143\u7d20\u5019\u9009\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c6\u56fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u63a8\u65ad\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u5728SceneFun3D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cAffordBot\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75283D\u70b9\u4e91\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c31\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "AffordBot\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea63D\u5177\u8eab\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57283D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, detecting distant, small, or occluded objects (hard instances) remains a challenge, which directly compromises the safety of autonomous driving systems. We observe that existing multi-modal 3D object detection methods often follow a single-guided paradigm, failing to account for the differences in information density of hard instances between modalities. In this work, we propose DGFusion, based on the Dual-guided paradigm, which fully inherits the advantages of the Point-guide-Image paradigm and integrates the Image-guide-Point paradigm to address the limitations of the single paradigms. The core of DGFusion, the Difficulty-aware Instance Pair Matcher (DIPM), performs instance-level feature matching based on difficulty to generate easy and hard instance pairs, while the Dual-guided Modules exploit the advantages of both pair types to enable effective multi-modal feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFusion outperforms the baseline methods, with respective improvements of +1.0\\% mAP, +0.8\\% NDS, and +1.3\\% average recall on nuScenes.

Prevailing methods based on signed distance fields (SDFs) are hampered by costly watertight preprocessing and struggle with non-manifold geometries, while point-cloud representations often suffer from sampling artifacts and surface discontinuities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) framework built upon unsigned distance fields (UDFs)-a more robust and computationally efficient representation that naturally handles complex and incomplete shapes. Our core innovation is a local-to-global (LoG) architecture that processes the UDF by partitioning it into uniform subvolumes, termed UBlocks. This architecture couples 3D convolutions for capturing local detail with sparse transformers for enforcing global coherence.

In this paper, we reveal a key property that is overlooked by existing methods: normal image patches across industrial products typically find many other similar patches, not only in 2D appearance but also in 3D shapes, while anomalies remain diverse and isolated. To explicitly leverage this discriminative property, we propose a Mutual Scoring framework (MuSc-V2) for zero-shot AC/AS, which flexibly supports single 2D/3D or multimodality. Specifically, our method begins by improving 3D representation through Iterative Point Grouping (IPG), which reduces false positives from discontinuous surfaces. Then we use Similarity Neighborhood Aggregation with Multi-Degrees (SNAMD) to fuse 2D/3D neighborhood cues into more discriminative multi-scale patch features for mutual scoring. The core comprises a Mutual Scoring Mechanism (MSM) that lets samples within each modality to assign score to each other, and Cross-modal Anomaly Enhancement (CAE) that fuses 2D and 3D scores to recover modality-specific missing anomalies. Finally, Re-scoring with Constrained Neighborhood (RsCon) suppresses false classification based on similarity to more representative samples. Our framework flexibly works on both the full dataset and smaller subsets with consistently robust performance, ensuring seamless adaptability across diverse product lines. In aid of the novel framework, MuSc-V2 achieves significant performance improvements: a $\\textbf{+23.7\\%}$ AP gain on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and a $\\textbf{+19.3\\%}$ boost on the Eyecandies dataset, surpassing previous zero-shot benchmarks and even outperforming most few-shot methods.

For data, we collect a comprehensive image screening dataset with over 128k samples, about 640k images. Each sample consists of an original image, four generated images. The dataset evaluates the image aesthetic reasoning ability under four aspects: appearance deformation, physical shadow, placement layout, and extension rationality. Regarding data annotation, we investigate multiple approaches, including purely manual, fully automated, and answer-driven annotations, to acquire high-quality chains of thought (CoT) data in the most cost-effective manner. Methodologically, we introduce a Hard Cases Mining (HCM) strategy with a Dynamic Proportional Accuracy (DPA) reward into the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, called HCM-GRPO. This enhanced method demonstrates superior image aesthetic reasoning capabilities compared to the original GRPO. Our experimental results reveal that even state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs, such as GPT4o and Qwen-VL-Max, exhibit performance akin to random guessing in image aesthetic reasoning.

To study this, we introduce a new benchmark, AV-ConfuseBench, which simulates an ``Audio-Visual Confusion'' scene by modifying the corresponding sound of an object in the video, e.g., mute the sounding object and ask MLLMs Is there a/an muted-object sound''. Experimental results reveal that MLLMs, such as Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemini 2.5, struggle to discriminate non-existent audio due to visually dominated reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we introduce RL-CoMM, a Reinforcement Learning-based Collaborative Multi-MLLM that is built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni foundation. RL-CoMM includes two stages: 1) To alleviate visually dominated ambiguities, we introduce an external model, a Large Audio Language Model (LALM), as the reference model to generate audio-only reasoning. Then, we design a Step-wise Reasoning Reward function that enables MLLMs to self-improve audio-visual reasoning with the audio-only reference. 2) To ensure an accurate answer prediction, we introduce Answer-centered Confidence Optimization to reduce the uncertainty of potential heterogeneous reasoning differences. Extensive experiments on audio-visual question answering and audio-visual hallucination show that RL-CoMM improves the accuracy by 10~30\\% over the baseline model with limited training data.

Hybrid Spatial Encoding, employing a Cartesian and Vector dual-stream strategy, effectively utilizes skeletal information in the form of joint and bone features.

This leads to confirmation bias, especially under sparse annotations or class imbalance, where models overfit confident errors and fail to generalize. We propose CABIN (Cognitive-Aware Behavior-Informed learNing), a semi-supervised framework that addresses this limitation through a closed-loop learning process of perception, action, and correction. CABIN first develops perceptual awareness by estimating epistemic uncertainty, identifying ambiguous regions where errors are likely to occur. It then acts by adopting an Uncertainty-Guided Dual Sampling Strategy, selecting uncertain samples for exploration while anchoring confident ones as stable pseudo-labels to reduce bias.

Existing generative methods typically operate on local joint rotations, which are defined hierarchically based on the skeleton structure. This leads to cumulative errors during generation, manifesting as unstable and implausible motions at end-effectors. In this work, we propose GlobalDiff, a diffusion-based framework that operates directly in the space of global joint rotations for the first time, fundamentally decoupling each joint's prediction from upstream dependencies and alleviating hierarchical error accumulation. To compensate for the absence of structural priors in global rotation space, we introduce a multi-level constraint scheme. Specifically, a joint structure constraint introduces virtual anchor points around each joint to better capture fine-grained orientation. A skeleton structure constraint enforces angular consistency across bones to maintain structural integrity. A temporal structure constraint utilizes a multi-scale variational encoder to align the generated motion with ground-truth temporal patterns. These constraints jointly regularize the global diffusion process and reinforce structural awareness.

However, the large number of visual tokens introduces significant computational overhead. To address this issue, visual token pruning has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the efficiency of MLLMs. In cognitive science, humans tend to first determine which regions of a scene to attend to (\"where to look\") before deciding which specific elements within those regions to process in detail (\"what to select\"). This two-stage strategy enables the visual system to efficiently allocate attention at a coarse spatial level before performing fine-grained selection. However, existing pruning methods primarily focus on directly optimizing \"what to select\", typically using attention scores or similarity metrics. They rarely consider \"where to look\", which has been shown to lead to inefficient spatial allocation, positional bias, and the retention of irrelevant or redundant tokens. In this paper, we propose GridPrune, a method that replaces the global Top-K mechanism with a \"guide-globally, select-locally\" zonal selection system. GridPrune splits the pruning process into two steps: first, it uses text-conditional guidance to dynamically allocate a token budget across spatial zones; and then, it performs local selection within each budgeted zone.

In this paper, we explore the combination of LLMs with the human skeleton to perform action classification and description.

To address these problems, we introduce a novel paradigm named learning Skeleton representation with visUal-motion knowledGe for Action Recognition (SUGAR). In our pipeline, we first utilize off-the-shelf large-scale video models as a knowledge base to generate visual, motion information related to actions. Then, we propose to supervise skeleton learning through this prior knowledge to yield discrete representations. Finally, we use the LLM with untouched pre-training weights to understand these representations and generate the desired action targets and descriptions. Notably, we present a Temporal Query Projection (TQP) module to continuously model the skeleton signals with long sequences.

However, the security vulnerabilities of LVLMs have become increasingly concerning, particularly their susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks focus on single-target attacks, i.e., targeting a single malicious output associated with a specific trigger. In this work, we uncover multi-target backdoor attacks, where multiple independent triggers corresponding to different attack targets are added in a single pass of training, posing a greater threat to LVLMs in real-world applications. Executing such attacks in LVLMs is challenging since there can be many incorrect trigger-target mappings due to severe feature interference among different triggers. To address this challenge, we propose MTAttack, the first multi-target backdoor attack framework for enforcing accurate multiple trigger-target mappings in LVLMs. The core of MTAttack is a novel optimization method with two constraints, namely Proxy Space Partitioning constraint and Trigger Prototype Anchoring constraint. It jointly optimizes multiple triggers in the latent space, with each trigger independently mapping clean images to a unique proxy class while at the same time guaranteeing their separability. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate a high success rate of MTAttack for multi-target attacks, substantially outperforming existing attack methods. Furthermore, our attack exhibits strong generalizability across datasets and robustness against backdoor defense strategies. These findings highlight the vulnerability of LVLMs to multi-target backdoor attacks and underscore the urgent need for mitigating such threats.

In this paper, we propose RobIA, a novel Robust, Instance-Aware framework for Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) in stereo depth estimation.

Recent methods primarily focus on leveraging additional prior knowledge and advanced multi-task architectures to achieve competitive performance.

Specifically, our model consists of two core components: Cross-modal Frame Aggregation aggregates relevant frames to extract temporally coherent, event-aligned textual features through cross-modal retrieval; and Context-aware Feature Enhancement utilizes query-guided attention to integrate visual dynamics with pseudo-event semantics.

Our analysis reveals a dramatic performance collapse: models that are accurate on single primitives fail precipitously when these are combined, exposing severe interference. We trace this failure to three key factors. First, training data show a near-total absence of explicit negations. Second, continuous attention architectures are fundamentally unsuitable for discrete logic. Third, evaluation metrics reward visual plausibility over constraint satisfaction. By analyzing recent benchmarks and methods, we show that current solutions and simple scaling cannot bridge this gap.

However, the representational capacity of INR defined by the range of functions the neural network can characterize, is inherently limited by the low-dimensional feature space in conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures. While widening the MLP can linearly increase feature space dimensionality, it also leads to a quadratic growth in computational and memory costs. To address this limitation, we propose the split-layer, a novel reformulation of MLP construction. The split-layer divides each layer into multiple parallel branches and integrates their outputs via Hadamard product, effectively constructing a high-degree polynomial space. This approach significantly enhances INR's representational capacity by expanding the feature space dimensionality without incurring prohibitive computational overhead.

Biases in detection models toward different demographic groups, such as gender and race, may lead to systemic misjudgments, exacerbating the digital divide and social inequities. However, current fairness-enhanced detectors often improve fairness at the cost of detection accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a dual-mechanism collaborative optimization framework. Our proposed method innovatively integrates structural fairness decoupling and global distribution alignment: decoupling channels sensitive to demographic groups at the model architectural level, and subsequently reducing the distance between the overall sample distribution and the distributions corresponding to each demographic group at the feature level. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with other methods, our framework improves both inter-group and intra-group fairness while maintaining overall detection accuracy across domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u673a\u5236\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u516c\u5e73\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5f80\u5f80\u4ee5\u727a\u7272\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\u6765\u6539\u5584\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u53d6\u3002\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6027\u522b\u3001\u79cd\u65cf\u7b49\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bef\u5224\uff0c\u52a0\u5267\u6570\u5b57\u9e3f\u6c9f\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u5730\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u516c\u5e73\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1a\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u5c42\u9762\u89e3\u8026\u5bf9\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u7fa4\u4f53\u654f\u611f\u7684\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5c42\u9762\u51cf\u5c11\u6574\u4f53\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u5404\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u7fa4\u4f53\u5bf9\u5e94\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6574\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ec4\u95f4\u548c\u7ec4\u5185\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53cc\u673a\u5236\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u8eab\u4efd\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although many TIPR methods have achieved promising results, sometimes textual queries cannot accurately and comprehensively reflect the content of the image, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and overfitting to limited datasets. Moreover, the inherent modality gap between text and image further amplifies these issues, making accurate cross-modal retrieval even more challenging. To address these limitations, we propose the Generation-Enhanced Alignment (GEA) from a generative perspective. GEA contains two parallel modules: (1) Text-Guided Token Enhancement (TGTE), which introduces diffusion-generated images as intermediate semantic representations to bridge the gap between text and visual patterns. These generated images enrich the semantic representation of text and facilitate cross-modal alignment. (2) Generative Intermediate Fusion (GIF), which combines cross-attention between generated images, original images, and text features to generate a unified representation optimized by triplet alignment loss. We conduct extensive experiments on three public TIPR datasets, CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReid, and ICFG-PEDES, to evaluate the performance of GEA. The results justify the effectiveness of our method.

In real-world scenarios, images often contain multiple degradations simultaneously, such as rain, noise, and haze, requiring models capable of handling diverse degradation types. Moreover, methods that improve performance through module stacking often suffer from limited interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability-driven approach for multi-degradation image restoration, built upon a deep unfolding network that maps the iterative process of a mathematical optimization algorithm into a learnable network structure. Specifically, we employ an improved second-order semi-smooth Newton algorithm to ensure that each module maintains clear physical interpretability. To further enhance interpretability and adaptability, we design an explainable convolution module inspired by the human brain's flexible information processing and the intrinsic characteristics of images, allowing the network to flexibly leverage learned knowledge and autonomously adjust parameters for different input.

Existing methods often fail to jointly capture agents' long-term goals and their fine-grained social interactions, which leads to unrealistic multi-agent futures. We propose VISTA, a recursive goal-conditioned transformer for multi-agent trajectory forecasting. VISTA combines (i) a cross-attention fusion module that integrates long-horizon intent with past motion, (ii) a social-token attention mechanism for flexible interaction modeling across agents, and (iii) pairwise attention maps that make social influence patterns interpretable at inference time. Our model turns single-agent goal-conditioned prediction into a coherent multi-agent forecasting framework. Beyond standard displacement metrics, we evaluate trajectory collision rates as a measure of joint realism. On the high-density MADRAS benchmark and on SDD, VISTA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and substantially fewer collisions. On MADRAS, it reduces the average collision rate of strong baselines from 2.14 to 0.03 percent, and on SDD it attains zero collisions while improving ADE, FDE, and minFDE.

Previous methods have predominantly employed diffusion models for high-fidelity reconstruction. However, their multi-step iterative sampling incurs significant computational overhead, limiting its real-time applicability. To address this, we propose LiNeXt-a lightweight, non-diffusion network optimized for rapid and accurate point cloud completion. Specifically, LiNeXt first applies the Noise-to-Coarse (N2C) Module to denoise the input noisy point cloud in a single pass, thereby obviating the multi-step iterative sampling of diffusion-based methods. The Refine Module then takes the coarse point cloud and its intermediate features from the N2C Module to perform more precise refinement, further enhancing structural completeness. Furthermore, we observe that LiDAR point clouds exhibit a distance-dependent spatial distribution, being densely sampled at proximal ranges and sparsely sampled at distal ranges. Accordingly, we propose the Distance-aware Selected Repeat strategy to generate a more uniformly distributed noisy point cloud. On the SemanticKITTI dataset, LiNeXt achieves a 199.8x speedup in inference, reduces Chamfer Distance by 50.7%, and uses only 6.1% of the parameters compared with LiDiff.

However, as more agents participate, existing frameworks face two key challenges: (1) the participating agents are inherently multi-modal and heterogeneous, and (2) the collaborative framework must be scalable to accommodate new agents. The former requires effective cross-agent feature alignment to mitigate heterogeneity loss, while the latter renders full-parameter training impractical, highlighting the importance of scalable adaptation. To address these issues, we propose Heterogeneous Adaptation (HeatV2X), a scalable collaborative framework. We first train a high-performance agent based on heterogeneous graph attention as the foundation for collaborative learning. Then, we design Local Heterogeneous Fine-Tuning and Global Collaborative Fine-Tuning to achieve effective alignment and interaction among heterogeneous agents. The former efficiently extracts modality-specific differences using Hetero-Aware Adapters, while the latter employs the Multi-Cognitive Adapter to enhance cross-agent collaboration and fully exploit the fusion potential.

This is a challenging task since it involves complex vision-language understanding and spatiotemporal reasoning. Recent works have explored weakly-supervised setting in STVG to eliminate reliance on fine-grained annotations like bounding boxes or temporal stamps. However, they typically follow a simple late-fusion manner, which generates tubes independent of the text description, often resulting in failed target identification and inconsistent target tracking. To address this limitation, we propose a Tube-conditioned Reconstruction with Mutual Constraints (\\textbf{TubeRMC}) framework that generates text-conditioned candidate tubes with pre-trained visual grounding models and further refine them via tube-conditioned reconstruction with spatio-temporal constraints. Specifically, we design three reconstruction strategies from temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal perspectives to comprehensively capture rich tube-text correspondences. Each strategy is equipped with a Tube-conditioned Reconstructor, utilizing spatio-temporal tubes as condition to reconstruct the key clues in the query. We further introduce mutual constraints between spatial and temporal proposals to enhance their quality for reconstruction.

In this paper, we construct the first AQA dataset containing fine-grained sub-score and deduction annotations for aerial skiing, which will be released as a new benchmark.

We propose Facial-R1, a three-stage alignment framework that effectively addresses both challenges with minimal supervision. First, we employ instruction fine-tuning to establish basic emotional reasoning capability. Second, we introduce reinforcement training guided by emotion and AU labels as reward signals, which explicitly aligns the generated reasoning process with the predicted emotion. Third, we design a data synthesis pipeline that iteratively leverages the prior stages to expand the training dataset, enabling scalable self-improvement of the model. Built upon this framework, we introduce FEA-20K, a benchmark dataset comprising 17,737 training and 1,688 test samples with fine-grained emotion analysis annotations. Extensive experiments across eight standard benchmarks demonstrate that Facial-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in FEA, with strong generalization and robust interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Facial-R1\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u9762\u90e8\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8bc6\u522b-\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u57288\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9762\u90e8\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff1a(1) \u5e7b\u89c9\u63a8\u7406 - \u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u4f46\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b(2) \u60c5\u611f\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8bc6\u522b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50 - \u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u6700\u7ec8\u6807\u7b7e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u672c\u60c5\u611f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1b2) \u4ee5\u60c5\u611f\u548cAU\u6807\u7b7e\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u60c5\u611f\uff1b3) \u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u8fed\u4ee3\u5229\u7528\u524d\u9636\u6bb5\u6269\u5c55\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86FEA-20K\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0817,737\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u548c1,688\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6837\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u57288\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Facial-R1\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9762\u90e8\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u76d1\u7763\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing approaches typically rely on feature-selection mechanisms or region-proposal strategies to localize discriminative regions for semantic analysis. However, these methods often fail to capture discriminative cues comprehensively while introducing substantial category-agnostic redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose H3Former, a novel token-to-region framework that leverages high-order semantic relations to aggregate local fine-grained representations with structured region-level modeling. Specifically, we propose the Semantic-Aware Aggregation Module (SAAM), which exploits multi-scale contextual cues to dynamically construct a weighted hypergraph among tokens. By applying hypergraph convolution, SAAM captures high-order semantic dependencies and progressively aggregates token features into compact region-level representations. Furthermore, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Loss (HHCL), which enforces hierarchical semantic constraints in a non-Euclidean embedding space. The HHCL enhances inter-class separability and intra-class consistency while preserving the intrinsic hierarchical relationships among fine-grained categories.

Existing post-training paradigms are limited: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) relies on costly step-level annotations, while Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods like GRPO provide only sparse, outcome-level feedback, hindering stable optimization. We introduce PROPA (Process-level Reasoning Optimization with interleaved Policy Alignment), a novel framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with GRPO to generate dense, process-level rewards and optimize reasoning at each intermediate step without human annotations. To overcome the cold-start problem, PROPA interleaves GRPO updates with SFT, enabling the model to learn from both successful and failed reasoning trajectories. A Process Reward Model (PRM) is further trained to guide inference-time search, aligning the test-time search with the training signal. Across seven benchmarks and four VLM backbones, PROPA consistently outperforms both SFT- and RLVR-based baselines. It achieves up to 17.0% gains on in-domain tasks and 21.0% gains on out-of-domain tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art, establishing a strong reasoning and generalization capability for visual reasoning tasks.

Existing inference-time interventions to mitigate this issue present a challenging trade-off: while methods that steer internal states or adjust output logits can be effective, they often incur substantial computational overhead, typically requiring extra forward passes. This efficiency bottleneck can limit their practicality for real-world, latency-sensitive deployments. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off with Residual-Update Directed DEcoding Regulation (RUDDER), a low-overhead framework that steers LVLMs towards visually-grounded generation. RUDDER is built on two key innovations: (1) Contextual Activation Residual Direction (CARD) vector, a per-sample visual evidence vector extracted from the residual update of a self-attention layer during a single, standard forward pass. (2) A Bayesian-inspired adaptive gate that performs token-wise injection, applying a corrective signal whose strength is conditioned on the model's deviation from the visual context. Extensive experiments on key hallucination benchmarks, including POPE and CHAIR, indicate that RUDDER achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while introducing negligible computational latency, validating RUDDER as a pragmatic and effective approach for improving LVLMs' reliability without a significant compromise on efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "RUDDER\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7f13\u89e3\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u654f\u611f\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRUDDER\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a(1) CARD\u5411\u91cf - \u5728\u5355\u6b21\u6807\u51c6\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u4ece\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u66f4\u65b0\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u5411\u91cf\uff1b(2) \u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7 - \u6839\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u79bb\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884ctoken\u7ea7\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\u6821\u6b63\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728POPE\u548cCHAIR\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u5e7b\u89c9\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cRUDDER\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "RUDDER\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u727a\u7272\u6548\u7387\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8LVLMs\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the morphological heterogeneity of informal settlements presents a major challenge, hindering the ability of models trained on specific regions to generalize effectively to unseen locations. To address this, we introduce a large-scale high-resolution dataset and propose GRAM (Generalized Region-Aware Mixture-of-Experts), a two-phase test-time adaptation framework that enables robust slum segmentation without requiring labeled data from target regions. We compile a million-scale satellite imagery dataset from 12 cities across four continents for source training. Using this dataset, the model employs a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to capture region-specific slum characteristics while learning universal features through a shared backbone. During adaptation, prediction consistency across experts filters out unreliable pseudo-labels, allowing the model to generalize effectively to previously unseen regions.

Specifically, considering the huge gap in the physical characteristics between natural images and infrared images, the TSG is designed to generate text semantics only for visible images, thereby enabling preliminary visible-text modality alignment. Then, the IFE is proposed to rectify the feature embeddings of infrared images using the generated text semantics. This process injects id-related semantics into the shared image encoder, enhancing its adaptability to the infrared modality. Besides, with text serving as a bridge, it enables indirect visible-infrared modality alignment. Finally, the HSA is established to refine the high-level semantic alignment. This process ensures that the fine-tuned text semantics only contain id-related information, thereby achieving more accurate cross-modal alignment and enhancing the discriminability of the learned modal-shared representations.

This paper proposes a novel computational framework that integrates depth-of-field supervision and multi-view consistency supervision to advance 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach comprises two core components: (1) Depth-of-field Supervision employs a scale-recovered monocular depth estimator (e.g., Metric3D) to generate depth priors, leverages defocus convolution to synthesize physically accurate defocused images, and enforces geometric consistency through a novel depth-of-field loss, thereby enhancing depth fidelity in both far-field and near-field regions; (2) Multi-View Consistency Supervision employing LoFTR-based semi-dense feature matching to minimize cross-view geometric errors and enforce depth consistency via least squares optimization of reliable matched points. By unifying defocus physics with multi-view geometric constraints, our method achieves superior depth fidelity, demonstrating a 0.8 dB PSNR improvement over the state-of-the-art method on the Waymo Open Dataset.

Code is available at https://github.com/lessiYin/DSANet", "summary": "Recent advancements in weakly-supervised video anomaly detection have achieved remarkable performance by applying the multiple instance learning paradigm based on multimodal foundation models such as CLIP to highlight anomalous instances and classify categories. However, their objectives may tend to detect the most salient response segments, while neglecting to mine diverse normal patterns separated from anomalies, and are prone to category confusion due to similar appearance, leading to unsatisfactory fine-grained classification results. Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Semantic Alignment Network (DSANet) to explicitly separate abnormal and normal features from coarse-grained and fine-grained aspects, enhancing the distinguishability. Specifically, at the coarse-grained level, we introduce a self-guided normality modeling branch that reconstructs input video features under the guidance of learned normal prototypes, encouraging the model to exploit normality cues inherent in the video, thereby improving the temporal separation of normal patterns and anomalous events. At the fine-grained level, we present a decoupled contrastive semantic alignment mechanism, which first temporally decomposes each video into event-centric and background-centric components using frame-level anomaly scores and then applies visual-language contrastive learning to enhance class-discriminative representations.

Real-world deployment requires open vocabulary generalization and low training overhead, motivating zero-shot methods rather than task-specific RL training. However, existing zero-shot methods that build explicit 3D scene graphs often compress rich visual observations into text-only relations, leading to high construction cost, irreversible loss of visual evidence, and constrained vocabularies. To address these limitations, we introduce the Multi-modal 3D Scene Graph (M3DSG), which preserves visual cues by replacing textual relational edges with dynamically assigned images. Built on M3DSG, we propose MSGNav, a zero-shot navigation system that includes a Key Subgraph Selection module for efficient reasoning, an Adaptive Vocabulary Update module for open vocabulary support, and a Closed-Loop Reasoning module for accurate exploration reasoning. Additionally, we further identify the last-mile problem in zero-shot navigation - determining the feasible target location with a suitable final viewpoint, and propose a Visibility-based Viewpoint Decision module to explicitly resolve it. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that MSGNav achieves state-of-the-art performance on GOAT-Bench and HM3D-OVON datasets.

Recent defense mechanisms like Anti-DreamBooth attempt to mitigate this risk by injecting adversarial perturbations into user photos to prevent successful personalization. However, we identify two critical yet overlooked limitations of these methods. First, the adversarial examples often exhibit perceptible artifacts such as conspicuous patterns or stripes, making them easily detectable as manipulated content. Second, the perturbations are highly fragile, as even a simple, non-learned filter can effectively remove them, thereby restoring the model's ability to memorize and reproduce user identity. To investigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel evaluation framework, AntiDB_Purify, to systematically evaluate existing defenses under realistic purification threats, including both traditional image filters and adversarial purification. Results reveal that none of the current methods maintains their protective effectiveness under such threats.

Our model is trained exclusively on simulated data, yet achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art methods that utilize real imagery. The Transformer-VAE incorporates the PROSAIL model as a differentiable physical decoder, ensuring that inferred latent variables correspond to physically plausible leaf and canopy properties. We demonstrate retrieval of leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) on real-world field datasets (FRM4Veg and BelSAR) with accuracy comparable to models trained with real Sentinel-2 data. Our method requires no in-situ labels or calibration on real images, offering a cost-effective and self-supervised solution for global vegetation monitoring.

However, real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images or formulas, and cross-page structures, which remain challenging for existing OCR systems. We introduce MonkeyOCR v1.5, a unified vision-language framework that enhances both layout understanding and content recognition through a two-stage parsing pipeline. The first stage employs a large multimodal model to jointly predict document layout and reading order, leveraging visual information to ensure structural and sequential consistency. The second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions, maintaining high visual fidelity while reducing error propagation. To address complex table structures, we propose a visual consistency-based reinforcement learning scheme that evaluates recognition quality via render-and-compare alignment, improving structural accuracy without manual annotations. Additionally, two specialized modules, Image-Decoupled Table Parsing and Type-Guided Table Merging, are introduced to enable reliable parsing of tables containing embedded images and reconstruction of tables crossing pages or columns.

Such data models cannot be directly measured by sensors and are typically generated from Digital Surface Models (DSMs) derived from LiDAR or photogrammetry. Traditional filtering approaches rely on manually tuned parameters, while learning-based methods require well-designed architectures, often combined with post-processing. To address these challenges, we introduce Ground Diffusion (GrounDiff), the first diffusion-based framework that iteratively removes non-ground structures by formulating the problem as a denoising task. We incorporate a gated design with confidence-guided generation that enables selective filtering. To increase scalability, we further propose Prior-Guided Stitching (PrioStitch), which employs a downsampled global prior automatically generated using GrounDiff to guide local high-resolution predictions. We evaluate our method on the DSM-to-DTM translation task across diverse datasets, showing that GrounDiff consistently outperforms deep learning-based state-of-the-art methods, reducing RMSE by up to 93% on ALS2DTM and up to 47% on USGS benchmarks. In the task of road reconstruction, which requires both high precision and smoothness, our method achieves up to 81% lower distance error compared to specialized techniques on the GeRoD benchmark, while maintaining competitive surface smoothness using only DSM inputs, without task-specific optimization. Our variant for road reconstruction, GrounDiff+, is specifically designed to produce even smoother surfaces, further surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

However, existing fault detection methods are largely limited to visual recognition, producing structured outputs that lack semantic interpretability and fail to support maintenance decision-making. To address these limitations, this study proposes an integrated framework that combines YOLOMS with a large language model (LLM) for intelligent fault analysis and diagnosis. Specifically, YOLOMS employs multi-scale detection and sliding-window cropping to enhance fault feature extraction, while a lightweight key-value (KV) mapping module bridges the gap between visual outputs and textual inputs. This module converts YOLOMS detection results into structured textual representations enriched with both qualitative and quantitative attributes. A domain-tuned LLM then performs semantic reasoning to generate interpretable fault analyses and maintenance recommendations.

Yet, digital pathology pipelines often rely on grid-based tiling that ignores tissue architecture. This introduces irrelevant information and limits interpretability. We introduce histology-informed tiling (HIT), which uses semantic segmentation to extract glands from whole slide images (WSIs) as biologically meaningful input patches for multiple-instance learning (MIL) and phenotyping.

Early detection is crucial as it can alter pancreas function through morphological changes and increased deposition of ectopic fat, eventually leading to organ damage. While studies have shown an association between T2DM and pancreas volume and fat content, the role of increased pancreatic surface lobularity (PSL) in patients with T2DM has not been fully investigated. In this pilot work, we propose a fully automated approach to delineate the pancreas and other abdominal structures, derive CT imaging biomarkers, and opportunistically screen for T2DM. Four deep learning-based models were used to segment the pancreas in an internal dataset of 584 patients (297 males, 437 non-diabetic, age: 45$\\pm$15 years). PSL was automatically detected and it was higher for diabetic patients (p=0.01) at 4.26 $\\pm$ 8.32 compared to 3.19 $\\pm$ 3.62 for non-diabetic patients. The PancAP model achieved the highest Dice score of 0.79 $\\pm$ 0.17 and lowest ASSD error of 1.94 $\\pm$ 2.63 mm (p$<$0.05).

In this paper, we propose SemanticVLA, a novel VLA framework that performs Semantic-Aligned Sparsification and Enhancement for Efficient Robotic Manipulation. Specifically: 1) To sparsify redundant perception while preserving semantic alignment, Semantic-guided Dual Visual Pruner (SD-Pruner) performs: Instruction-driven Pruner (ID-Pruner) extracts global action cues and local semantic anchors in SigLIP; Spatial-aggregation Pruner (SA-Pruner) compacts geometry-rich features into task-adaptive tokens in DINOv2. 2) To exploit sparsified features and integrate semantics with spatial geometry, Semantic-complementary Hierarchical Fuser (SH-Fuser) fuses dense patches and sparse tokens across SigLIP and DINOv2 for coherent representation. 3) To enhance the transformation from perception to action, Semantic-conditioned Action Coupler (SA-Coupler) replaces the conventional observation-to-DoF approach, yielding more efficient and interpretable behavior modeling for manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on simulation and real-world tasks show that SemanticVLA sets a new SOTA in both performance and efficiency. SemanticVLA surpasses OpenVLA on LIBERO benchmark by 21.1% in success rate, while reducing training cost and inference latency by 3.0-fold and 2.7-fold.SemanticVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/SemanticVLA", "AI": {"tldr": "SemanticVLA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u6307\u4ee4-\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u90fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684SOTA\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dVLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff1a1\uff09\u611f\u77e5\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u65e0\u5173\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff1b2\uff09\u6307\u4ee4-\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\u80a4\u6d45\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cc\u89c6\u89c9\u526a\u679d\u5668\uff08SD-Pruner\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u526a\u679d\u5668\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u5408\u526a\u679d\u5668\uff1b2\uff09\u8bed\u4e49\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u878d\u5408\u5668\uff08SH-Fuser\uff09\uff0c\u878d\u5408SigLIP\u548cDINOv2\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u8865\u4e01\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6807\u8bb0\uff1b3\uff09\u8bed\u4e49\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u8026\u5408\u5668\uff08SA-Coupler\uff09\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSemanticVLA\u5728LIBERO\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6bd4OpenVLA\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad821.1%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e3.0\u500d\u548c2.7\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "SemanticVLA\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u4e3aVLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite considerable progress in 4D neural rendering, existing approaches either model dynamic scenes holistically or model scenes and backgrounds separately aim to introduce parametric human priors. However, these approaches either neglect distinct motion characteristics of various components in scene especially human, leading to incomplete reconstructions, or ignore the information exchange between the separately modeled components, resulting in spatial inconsistencies and visual artifacts at human-scene boundaries. To address this, we propose {\\bf Separate-then-Map} (StM) strategy that introduces a dedicated information mapping mechanism to bridge separately defined and optimized models. Our method employs a shared transformation function for each Gaussian attribute to unify separately modeled components, enhancing computational efficiency by avoiding exhaustive pairwise interactions while ensuring spatial and visual coherence between humans and their surroundings.

To date, this field has only been primarily explored by the industry (e.g., Midjourney), with no open-source research from the academic community. To fill this gap, we propose CoTyle, the first open-source method for this task. Specifically, we first train a discrete style codebook from a collection of images to extract style embeddings. These embeddings serve as conditions for a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I-DM) to generate stylistic images. Subsequently, we train an autoregressive style generator on the discrete style embeddings to model their distribution, allowing the synthesis of novel style embeddings. During inference, a numerical style code is mapped to a unique style embedding by the style generator, and this embedding guides the T2I-DM to generate images in the corresponding style. Unlike existing methods, our method offers unparalleled simplicity and diversity, unlocking a vast space of reproducible styles from minimal input. Extensive experiments validate that CoTyle effectively turns a numerical code into a style controller, demonstrating a style is worth one code.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CoTyle\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u4ee3\u7801\u63a7\u5236\u56fe\u50cf\u98ce\u683c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\"\u4e00\u4e2a\u98ce\u683c\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\"\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5197\u957f\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u6216\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u521b\u9020\u529b\u6709\u9650\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u8868\u793a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u96c6\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u79bb\u6563\u98ce\u683c\u7801\u672c\u63d0\u53d6\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u98ce\u683c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5efa\u6a21\u98ce\u683c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7528\u6570\u503c\u4ee3\u7801\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1CoTyle\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5c06\u6570\u503c\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4ece\u6700\u5c0f\u8f93\u5165\u89e3\u9501\u5927\u91cf\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u98ce\u683c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\"\u4e00\u4e2a\u98ce\u683c\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\"\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u98ce\u683c\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address this issue, we introduce OmniVGGT, a novel framework that can effectively benefit from an arbitrary number of auxiliary geometric modalities during both training and inference. In our framework, a GeoAdapter is proposed to encode depth and camera intrinsics/extrinsics into a spatial foundation model. It employs zero-initialized convolutions to progressively inject geometric information without disrupting the foundation model's representation space. This design ensures stable optimization with negligible overhead, maintaining inference speed comparable to VGGT even with multiple additional inputs. Additionally, a stochastic multimodal fusion regimen is proposed, which randomly samples modality subsets per instance during training. This enables an arbitrary number of modality inputs during testing and promotes learning robust spatial representations instead of overfitting to auxiliary cues. Comprehensive experiments on monocular/multi-view depth estimation, multi-view stereo, and camera pose estimation demonstrate that OmniVGGT outperforms prior methods with auxiliary inputs and achieves state-of-the-art results even with RGB-only input. To further highlight its practical utility, we integrated OmniVGGT into vision-language-action (VLA) models.

To address data scarcity, existing methods attempt to reuse 2D full-field digital mammography (FFDM) models by either flattening DBT volumes or processing slices individually, thus discarding volumetric information. Alternatively, 3D reasoning approaches introduce complex architectures that require more DBT training data. Tackling these drawbacks, we propose M&M-3D, an architecture that enables learnable 3D reasoning while remaining parameter-free relative to its FFDM counterpart, M&M. M&M-3D constructs malignancy-guided 3D features, and 3D reasoning is learned through repeatedly mixing these 3D features with slice-level information. This is achieved by modifying operations in M&M without adding parameters, thus enabling direct weight transfer from FFDM. Extensive experiments show that M&M-3D surpasses 2D projection and 3D slice-based methods by 11-54% for localization and 3-10% for classification. Additionally, M&M-3D outperforms complex 3D reasoning variants by 20-47% for localization and 2-10% for classification in the low-data regime, while matching their performance in high-data regime.

We present the Latent Upscaler Adapter (LUA), a lightweight module that performs super-resolution directly on the generator's latent code before the final VAE decoding step. LUA integrates as a drop-in component, requiring no modifications to the base model or additional diffusion stages, and enables high-resolution synthesis through a single feed-forward pass in latent space. A shared Swin-style backbone with scale-specific pixel-shuffle heads supports 2x and 4x factors and remains compatible with image-space SR baselines, achieving comparable perceptual quality with nearly 3x lower decoding and upscaling time (adding only +0.42 s for 1024 px generation from 512 px, compared to 1.87 s for pixel-space SR using the same SwinIR architecture). Furthermore, LUA shows strong generalization across the latent spaces of different VAEs, making it easy to deploy without retraining from scratch for each new decoder.

In pursuit of minimal modeling, DA3 yields two key insights: a single plain transformer (e.g., vanilla DINO encoder) is sufficient as a backbone without architectural specialization, and a singular depth-ray prediction target obviates the need for complex multi-task learning. Through our teacher-student training paradigm, the model achieves a level of detail and generalization on par with Depth Anything 2 (DA2). We establish a new visual geometry benchmark covering camera pose estimation, any-view geometry and visual rendering.

In the multiple-choice setting - a dominant format for multimodal reasoning benchmarks - the paradigm faces a significant yet often overlooked obstacle: unfaithful trajectories that guess the correct option after a faulty chain of thought receive the same reward as genuine reasoning, which is a flaw that cannot be ignored. We propose Self-Consistency Sampling (SCS) to correct this issue. For each question, SCS (i) introduces small visual perturbations and (ii) performs repeated truncation and resampling of an initial trajectory; agreement among the resulting trajectories yields a differentiable consistency score that down-weights unreliable traces during policy updates. Based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, plugging SCS into RLOO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++ series improves accuracy by up to 7.7 percentage points on six multimodal benchmarks with negligible extra computation. SCS also yields notable gains on both Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct and InternVL3-8B, offering a simple, general remedy for outcome-reward RL in MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSelf-Consistency Sampling (SCS)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u8f68\u8ff9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u591a\u9009\u9898\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u4e00\u4e2a\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u969c\u788d\uff1a\u5373\u4f7f\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u5b58\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u4f46\u731c\u5bf9\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4e0e\u771f\u6b63\u6b63\u786e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u83b7\u5f97\u76f8\u540c\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "SCS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a(i) \u5f15\u5165\u5c0f\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6270\u52a8\uff1b(ii) \u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u590d\u622a\u65ad\u548c\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u679c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u5fae\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8eQwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06SCS\u96c6\u6210\u5230RLOO\u3001GRPO\u548cREINFORCE++\u7cfb\u5217\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe7.7\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u3002\u5728Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct\u548cInternVL3-8B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e5f\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "SCS\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While flow-based models are fast, they often produce geometrically inaccurate structures, as they have difficulty capturing the multimodal distributions of molecular conformations. In contrast, denoising diffusion models are more accurate but suffer from slow sampling, a limitation attributed to sub-optimal integration between diffusion dynamics and SE(3)-equivariant architectures. To address this, we propose VEDA, a unified SE(3)-equivariant framework that combines variance-exploding diffusion with annealing to efficiently generate conformationally accurate 3D molecular structures. Specifically, our key technical contributions include: (1) a VE schedule that enables noise injection functionally analogous to simulated annealing, improving 3D accuracy and reducing relaxation energy; (2) a novel preconditioning scheme that reconciles the coordinate-predicting nature of SE(3)-equivariant networks with a residual-based diffusion objective, and (3) a new arcsin-based scheduler that concentrates sampling in critical intervals of the logarithmic signal-to-noise ratio. On the QM9 and GEOM-DRUGS datasets, VEDA matches the sampling efficiency of flow-based models, achieving state-of-the-art valency stability and validity with only 100 sampling steps. More importantly, VEDA's generated structures are remarkably stable, as measured by their relaxation energy during GFN2-xTB optimization. The median energy change is only 1.72 kcal/mol, significantly lower than the 32.3 kcal/mol from its architectural baseline, SemlaFlow.

AI cognitive assistants, acting as virtual partners, have the potential to ease this burden by supporting real-time data collection and decision making. In pursuit of this vision, we introduce EgoEMS, the first end-to-end, high-fidelity, multimodal, multiperson dataset capturing over 20 hours of realistic, procedural EMS activities from an egocentric view in 233 simulated emergency scenarios performed by 62 participants, including 46 EMS professionals. Developed in collaboration with EMS experts and aligned with national standards, EgoEMS is captured using an open-source, low-cost, and replicable data collection system and is annotated with keysteps, timestamped audio transcripts with speaker diarization, action quality metrics, and bounding boxes with segmentation masks.

As dataset size increases, this bias drives generation toward overly smooth, homogeneous samples, reducing intra-class diversity and limiting generalization. We present PRISM (PRIors from diverse Source Models), a framework that disentangles architectural priors during synthesis. PRISM decouples the logit-matching and regularization objectives, supervising them with different teacher architectures: a primary model for logits and a stochastic subset for batch-normalization (BN) alignment. On ImageNet-1K, PRISM consistently and reproducibly outperforms single-teacher methods (e.g., SRe2L) and recent multi-teacher variants (e.g., G-VBSM) at low- and mid-IPC regimes. The generated data also show significantly richer intra-class diversity, as reflected by a notable drop in cosine similarity between features. We further analyze teacher selection strategies (pre- vs. intra-distillation) and introduce a scalable cross-class batch formation scheme for fast parallel synthesis.

However, existing approaches face several challenges: (i) indiscriminate generation that ignores the solver's ability and yields low-value problems, or reliance on complex data pipelines to balance problem difficulty; and (ii) a lack of reasoning in problem generation, leading to shallow problem variants. In this paper, we develop a problem generator that reasons explicitly to plan problem directions before synthesis and adapts difficulty to the solver's ability. Specifically, we construct related problem pairs and augment them with intermediate problem-design CoT produced by a reasoning model. These data bootstrap problem-design strategies from the generator. Then, we treat the solver's feedback on synthetic problems as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce complementary problems near the edge of the solver's competence. Extensive experiments on 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that our method achieves an average improvement of 2.5% and generalizes to both language and vision-language models. Moreover, a solver trained on the synthesized data provides improved rewards for continued generator training, enabling co-evolution and yielding a further 0.7% performance gain.

We navigate the complexities of dataset curation, preprocessing strategies, and model architecture, aligning with research objectives encompassing model effectiveness, computational cost analysis, and time complexity assessment. Results underscore the supremacy of tailored CNN models over pre-trained counterparts, evident in heightened accuracy and F1-scores. Implementation of a voting system further enhances performance.

The goal of the attack is to modify the original explanations while being undetected by the human eye and maintain the same predicted class. In contrast to previous methods, we do not require any access to the model or its weights, but only to the model's computed predictions and explanations. Additionally, the attack is accomplished in a single step while significantly changing the provided explanations, as demonstrated by empirical evaluation. The low requirements of our method expose a critical vulnerability in current explainability methods, raising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical applications. We systematically generate attacks based on the explanations generated by post-hoc explainability methods (saliency maps, integrated gradients, and DeepLIFT SHAP) for pretrained ResNet-18 and ViT-B16 on ImageNet. The results show that our attacks could lead to dramatically different explanations without changing the predictive probabilities.

This, however, disregards the presence of redundant examples and inherent differences in the learning difficulties of classes. Alternatively, one can use complex measures such as training loss and uncertainty, which, however, depend on training a machine learning model. Our paper proposes using data Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) as an easy-to-compute, model-free measure of imbalance that can be seamlessly incorporated into various imbalance mitigation methods. Our results across five different datasets with a diverse range of imbalance ratios show that ID consistently outperforms cardinality-based re-weighting and re-sampling techniques used in the literature. Moreover, we show that combining ID with cardinality can further improve performance.

In recent times, Pre-LayerNorm transformers have become the preferred choice over Post-LayerNorm transformers due to their stable gradient flow. However, the impact of LayerNorm on learning and memorization across these architectures remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how LayerNorm influences memorization and learning for Pre- and Post-LayerNorm transformers. We identify that LayerNorm serves as a key factor for stable learning in Pre-LayerNorm transformers, while in Post-LayerNorm transformers, it impacts memorization. Our analysis reveals that eliminating LayerNorm parameters in Pre-LayerNorm models exacerbates memorization and destabilizes learning, while in Post-LayerNorm models, it effectively mitigates memorization by restoring genuine labels. We further precisely identify that early layers LayerNorm are the most critical over middle/later layers and their influence varies across Pre and Post LayerNorm models. We have validated it through 13 models across 6 Vision and Language datasets. These insights shed new light on the role of LayerNorm in shaping memorization and learning in transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "LayerNorm\u5728\u4e0d\u540ctransformer\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1aPre-LayerNorm\u4e2d\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0cPost-LayerNorm\u4e2d\u5f71\u54cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76LayerNorm\u5728Pre-\u548cPost-LayerNorm transformers\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u8fd9\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u679013\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u57286\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7814\u7a76LayerNorm\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "result": "Pre-LayerNorm\u4e2d\u53bb\u9664LayerNorm\u53c2\u6570\u4f1a\u52a0\u5267\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u5e76\u7834\u574f\u5b66\u4e60\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u800cPost-LayerNorm\u4e2d\u53bb\u9664LayerNorm\u53c2\u6570\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u5e76\u6062\u590d\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e", "conclusion": "LayerNorm\u5728transformer\u4e2d\u5851\u9020\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u9762\u53d1\u6325\u7740\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u540c\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u7684LayerNorm\u6700\u4e3a\u5173\u952e"}}

As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6545\u969c\u573a\u666f\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6a21\u62df\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4eff\u771f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684sim-to-real\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u6545\u969c\u573a\u666f\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u590d\u73b0\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u6807\u8bb0\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u5982\u4f55\u5339\u914d\u62bd\u8c61\u573a\u666f\uff08\u4f7f\u7528Scenic\u6982\u7387\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u67e5\u8be2\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u5339\u914d\u6307\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u573a\u666f\u65f6\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u89c6\u89c9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u5feb\u6570\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u968f\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u957f\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4eff\u771f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6545\u969c\u573a\u666f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}
