To do so, we propose a two-step process of feature\nextraction and gated attention for image aggregation. We evaluate the\neffectiveness of our model by comparing against other model architectures,\ninterpreting our learned weights, and performing a case study.

TS operates through\ntwo main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is\nlikely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of\nframes from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model\nto produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the\nmodel by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal\nintervals, improving its understanding of long videos. Additionally,\nkeyframe-level descriptions are collected to facilitate cross-interval\nperception throughout the video. To further improve efficiency, we introduce\nTS-BFS, a best-first search strategy over a tree.

However, in long-tail scenarios, accurately predicting the\nsafety of the ego vehicle's future motion remains a major challenge due to\nuncertainties in dynamic environments and limitations in data coverage. In this\nwork, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk\nprediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing\nhigh-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based\nmotion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle,\nother vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize\nplug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call\nDriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation\nframework, named DriveMRP-Agent.

Our\nmethodology leverages the strengths of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite\nimagery, integrated with national-scale farm boundary data.

Our approach\nincorporates an automated season detection algorithm, which estimates crop\nsowing and harvest periods. This allows for reliable crop identification as\nearly as two months into the growing season and facilitates rigorous in-season\nperformance evaluation.

Additionally, we\nincorporate textual guidance from domain experts and large language models\n(LLM) to enhance feature representation and improve model interpretability.\nExperiments on the large-scale Scoliosis1K gait dataset show that TG-MILNet\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in handling class\nimbalance and accurately detecting challenging borderline cases.

This can\nerode trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generalizable\ndetectors for generated images. Recent methods leverage diffusion denoising\ncues, but mainly focus on single-step reconstruction errors, ignoring the\ninherent sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose\nLATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the\nevolution of latent embeddings across several denoising timesteps. By modeling\nthe trajectory of such embeddings rather than single-step errors, LATTE\ncaptures subtle, discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated\nimages. Each latent is refined by employing our latent-visual feature\nrefinement module and aggregated into a unified representation. Afterwards, it\nis fused with the visual features and finally passed into a lightweight\nclassifier. Our experiments demonstrate that LATTE surpasses the baselines on\nseveral established benchmarks, such as GenImage and DiffusionFake. Moreover,\nit demonstrates strong performance in cross-generator and cross-datasets\nsettings, highlighting the potential of using the trajectory of latent\nembeddings for generated image detection.

Existing research commonly attributes\nhallucinations to technical limitations or sycophancy bias, where the latter\nmeans the models tend to generate incorrect answers to align with user\nexpectations. However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or\nexternally driven factors, may have neglected the possibility that\nhallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human\npsychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing\nVLMs' hallucination behaviours, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency,\nand a newly identified VLMs behaviour: authority bias. To systematically\nanalyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals\npsychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark,\nwe investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size\ninfluence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated\nquestions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit\nstronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting\nincreasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human\nsubject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural\ndifferences between VLMs and human respondents.

However, HAR sensor signals are subject to significant domain\nshifts caused by subject variability. These domain shifts hinder model\ngeneralization to unseen subjects by embedding subject-specific variations\nrather than activity-specific features. As a result, human activity recognition\nmodels trained with contrastive learning often struggle to generalize to new\nsubjects. We introduce Subject-Invariant Contrastive Learning (SICL), a simple\nyet effective loss function to improve generalization in human activity\nrecognition.

In\nthis work, we introduce MolVision, a novel approach that leverages\nVision-Language Models (VLMs) by integrating both molecular structure as images\nand textual descriptions to enhance property prediction. We construct a\nbenchmark spanning ten diverse datasets, covering classification, regression\nand description tasks.

Although existing DG techniques, such as data manipulation, learning\nstrategies, and representation learning, have shown significant progress, they\npredominantly address single-modal data. With the emergence of numerous\nmulti-modal datasets and increasing demand for multi-modal tasks, a key\nchallenge in Multi-modal Domain Generalization (MMDG) has emerged: enabling\nmodels trained on multi-modal sources to generalize to unseen target\ndistributions within the same modality set. Due to the inherent differences\nbetween modalities, directly transferring methods from single-modal DG to MMDG\ntypically yields sub-optimal results. These methods often exhibit randomness\nduring generalization due to the invisibility of target domains and fail to\nconsider inter-modal consistency. Applying these methods independently to each\nmodality in the MMDG setting before combining them can lead to divergent\ngeneralization directions across different modalities, resulting in degraded\ngeneralization capabilities.

We propose a novel global motion averaging\nframework for multi-camera systems, featuring two core components: a decoupled\nrotation averaging module and a hybrid translation averaging module. Our\nrotation averaging employs a hierarchical strategy by first estimating relative\nrotations within rigid camera units and then computing global rigid unit\nrotations. To enhance the robustness of translation averaging, we incorporate\nboth camera-to-camera and camera-to-point constraints to initialize camera\npositions and 3D points with a convex distance-based objective function and\nrefine them with an unbiased non-bilinear angle-based objective function.\nExperiments on large-scale datasets show that our system matches or exceeds\nincremental SfM accuracy while significantly improving efficiency.

Conventional\nnetwork binarization approaches, which directly quantize both weights and\nactivations in change detection models, severely limit the network's ability to\nrepresent input data and distinguish between changed and unchanged regions.\nThis results in significantly lower detection accuracy compared to real-valued\nnetworks. To overcome these challenges, BiCD enhances both the representational\npower and feature separability of BNNs, improving detection performance.\nSpecifically, we introduce an auxiliary objective based on the Information\nBottleneck (IB) principle, guiding the encoder to retain essential input\ninformation while promoting better feature discrimination. Since directly\ncomputing mutual information under the IB principle is intractable, we design a\ncompact, learnable auxiliary module as an approximation target, leading to a\nsimple yet effective optimization strategy that minimizes both reconstruction\nloss and standard change detection loss. Extensive experiments on street-view\nand remote sensing datasets demonstrate that BiCD establishes a new benchmark\nfor BNN-based change detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance in this\ndomain.", "AI": {"tldr": "BiCD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u91cf\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0cBiCD\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u539f\u5219\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u91cd\u6784\u635f\u5931\u548c\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8857\u666f\u548c\u9065\u611f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cBiCD\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "BiCD\u4e3a\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\u8bbe\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u6807\u6746\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

(b) The performance of zero-shot generic foundation models improves on\nover-segmented face images than tightly cropped faces thereby suggesting the\nimportance of contextual clues. For example, at a False Match Rate (FMR) of\n0.01%, the True Match Rate (TMR) of OpenCLIP improved from 64.97% to 81.73% on\nthe LFW dataset as the face crop increased from 112x112 to 250x250 while the\nTMR of domain-specific AdaFace dropped from 99.09% to 77.31%.

As distance increases, intensified scattering leads to severe\nhaze and signal loss, making it impractical to recover distant details solely\nfrom visible images. Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers\ncritical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing\nmethods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in\nvisible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue\nthat the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary\nlow-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency.\nMotivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF)\nframework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a\nvisual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared\nmodality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by\naligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared\nsemantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant\nscenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on\nrecovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary\ncues from both visible and near-infrared images. Through the cooperation of\ndual streams, HSVF produces results that exhibit both high-contrast scenes and\nrich texture details.

However, most existing DG-based works have merely focused on\nmodeling statistical dependence between sensor data and activity labels,\nneglecting the importance of intrinsic casual mechanism. Intuitively, every\nsensor input can be viewed as a mixture of causal (category-aware) and\nnon-causal factors (domain-specific), where only the former affects activity\nclassification judgment. In this paper, by casting such DG-based HAR as a\ncasual inference problem, we propose a causality-inspired representation\nlearning algorithm for cross-domain activity recognition. To this end, an\nearly-forking two-branch framework is designed, where two separate branches are\nrespectively responsible for learning casual and non-causal features, while an\nindependence-based Hilbert-Schmidt Information Criterion is employed to\nimplicitly disentangling them. Additionally, an inhomogeneous domain sampling\nstrategy is designed to enhance disentanglement, while a category-aware domain\nperturbation layer is performed to prevent representation collapse. Extensive\nexperiments on several public HAR benchmarks demonstrate that our\ncausality-inspired approach significantly outperforms eleven related\nstate-of-the-art baselines under cross-person, cross-dataset, and\ncross-position settings.

However, the slow inference speed and high\ncomputational cost of these large models bring significant challenges for\npractical applications. Additionally, various tasks in human animation, such as\nlip-syncing, audio-driven full-body animation, and video generation from start\nand end frames, often require different specialized models. The introduction of\nlarge video models has not alleviated this dilemma. This raises an important\nquestion: Can we make human animation Faster, Higher in quality, Stronger in\ngeneralization, and make various tasks Together in one model? To address this,\nwe dive into video generation models and discover that the devil lies in the\ndetails: Inspired by MAE, we propose a novel unified Multi-Task paradigm for\nhuman animation, treating diverse generation tasks as spatial-temporal local\nreconstructions, requiring modifications only on the input side; Given the\ninterplay and division among multi-modal conditions including text, image, and\naudio, we introduce a multi-modal decoupled cross-attention module to fuse\nmulti-modals in a divide-and-conquer manner; We propose a new SFT+Reward\nalternating training paradigm, enabling the minimal model with 1.3B parameters\nto achieve generation quality comparable to models with 10 times the parameters\ncount. Through these innovations, our work paves the way for efficient,\nhigh-quality, and versatile digital human generation, addressing both\nperformance and practicality challenges in the field.

Current scene flow\nestimation methods for mmWave radar are typically supervised by dense point\nclouds from 3D LiDARs, which are expensive and not widely available in smart\nvehicles. While VI data are more accessible, visual images alone cannot capture\nthe 3D motions of moving objects, making it difficult to supervise their scene\nflow. Moreover, the temporal drift of VI rigid transformation also degenerates\nthe scene flow estimation of static points. To address these challenges, we\npropose a drift-free rigid transformation estimator that fuses kinematic\nmodel-based ego-motions with neural network-learned results. It provides strong\nsupervision signals to radar-based rigid transformation and infers the scene\nflow of static points. Then, we develop an optical-mmWave supervision\nextraction module that extracts the supervision signals of radar rigid\ntransformation and scene flow. It strengthens the supervision by learning the\nscene flow of dynamic points with the joint constraints of optical and mmWave\nradar measurements.

Existing low-light enhancement methods often\nstruggle to effectively preprocess such low-light inputs, as they fail to\nconsider correlations among multiple views. Although other state-of-the-art\nmethods have introduced illumination-related components offering alternative\nsolutions to the problem, they often result in drawbacks such as color\ndistortions and artifacts, and they provide limited denoising effectiveness. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel Robust Low-light Scene Restoration framework\n(RoSe), which enables effective synthesis of novel views in normal lighting\nconditions from low-light multiview image inputs, by formulating the task as an\nilluminance transition estimation problem in 3D space, conceptualizing it as a\nspecialized rendering task. This multiview-consistent illuminance transition\nfield establishes a robust connection between low-light and normal-light\nconditions. By further exploiting the inherent low-rank property of\nillumination to constrain the transition representation, we achieve more\neffective denoising without complex 2D techniques or explicit noise modeling.\nTo implement RoSe, we design a concise dual-branch architecture and introduce a\nlow-rank denoising module.

In this work, we\nexplore the potential of synthetic data from driving world models to enhance\nthe diversity of labeled data for robustifying BEV segmentation.

The quadratic\ncomputational complexity relative to window size restricts its ability to use a\nlarge window size for expanding the receptive field while maintaining low\ncomputational costs. To address this challenge, we propose PromptSR, a novel\nprompt-empowered lightweight image SR method. The core component is the\nproposed cascade prompting block (CPB), which enhances global information\naccess and local refinement via three cascaded prompting layers: a global\nanchor prompting layer (GAPL) and two local prompting layers (LPLs). The GAPL\nleverages downscaled features as anchors to construct low-dimensional anchor\nprompts (APs) through cross-scale attention, significantly reducing\ncomputational costs. These APs, with enhanced global perception, are then used\nto provide global prompts, efficiently facilitating long-range token\nconnections. The two LPLs subsequently combine category-based self-attention\nand window-based self-attention to refine the representation in a\ncoarse-to-fine manner. They leverage attention maps from the GAPL as additional\nglobal prompts, enabling them to perceive features globally at different\ngranularities for adaptive local refinement. In this way, the proposed CPB\neffectively combines global priors and local details, significantly enlarging\nthe receptive field while maintaining the low computational costs of our\nPromptSR. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method,\nwhich outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight SR methods in quantitative,\nqualitative, and complexity evaluations.

Experiments\nwere conducted on three common datasets-JAAD, PIE, and FU-PIP. Results\ndemonstrate that incorporating vehicle speed, its variations over time, and\ntime-conscious prompts significantly enhances the prediction accuracy up to\n19.8%. Additionally, optimised prompts generated via an automatic prompt\nengineering framework yielded 12.5% further accuracy gains. These findings\nhighlight the superior performance of VLFMs compared to conventional\nvision-based models, offering enhanced generalisation and contextual\nunderstanding for autonomous driving applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLFMs\uff09\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u884c\u4eba\u8fc7\u9a6c\u8def\u610f\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u677f\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528VLFMs\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u677f\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u5e27\u3001\u7269\u7406\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u6001\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f66\u8f86\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u53ef\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u534719.8%\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e8612.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "VLFMs\u5728\u884c\u4eba\u8fc7\u9a6c\u8def\u610f\u56fe\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

This scarcity hinders generalization to\nreal-world scenarios. To address this, most existing methods finetune\nfoundation image generative models to exploit their learned visual priors.\nHowever, these approaches typically generate only multi-view images and rely on\npost-processing to produce UV texture maps -- an essential representation in\nmodern graphics pipelines. Such two-stage pipelines often suffer from error\naccumulation and spatial inconsistencies across the 3D surface. In this paper,\nwe introduce SeqTex, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages the visual\nknowledge encoded in pretrained video foundation models to directly generate\ncomplete UV texture maps. Unlike previous methods that model the distribution\nof UV textures in isolation, SeqTex reformulates the task as a sequence\ngeneration problem, enabling the model to learn the joint distribution of\nmulti-view renderings and UV textures. This design effectively transfers the\nconsistent image-space priors from video foundation models into the UV domain.\nTo further enhance performance, we propose several architectural innovations: a\ndecoupled multi-view and UV branch design, geometry-informed attention to guide\ncross-domain feature alignment, and adaptive token resolution to preserve fine\ntexture details while maintaining computational efficiency. Together, these\ncomponents allow SeqTex to fully utilize pretrained video priors and synthesize\nhigh-fidelity UV texture maps without the need for post-processing.

Our motivation stems from the\nobservation that existing fusion strategies are constrained by their inability\nto simultaneously achieve efficiency, long-range modeling, and retaining\ncomplete scene information. Inspired by recent advances in state-space models\n(SSMs) and linear attention, we leverage their linear complexity and long-range\nmodeling capabilities to address these challenges. However, this is non-trivial\nsince our experiments reveal that simply adopting efficient linear-complexity\nmethods does not necessarily yield improvements and may even degrade\nperformance. We attribute this degradation to the loss of height information\nduring multi-modal alignment, leading to deviations in sequence order. To\nresolve this, we propose height-fidelity LiDAR encoding that preserves precise\nheight information through voxel compression in continuous space, thereby\nenhancing camera-LiDAR alignment.

Validated on this dataset, our\nframework generates detailed 3D structures from a single satellite image,\nachieving superior fidelity compared to existing city generation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Sat2City\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u4f53\u7d20\u7f51\u683c\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u8be6\u7ec63D\u57ce\u5e02\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u795e\u7ecf\u6e32\u67d3\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u76842D\u89c2\u6d4b\u751f\u6210\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8be6\u7ec63D\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSat2City\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7ea7\u8054\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3001Re-Hash\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u9006\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65b03D\u57ce\u5e02\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f3D\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57ce\u5e02\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "Sat2City\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D\u57ce\u5e02\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To improve its performance on real-world data,\ndepth regularizations have proven to be the most effective ones. However, depth\nestimation models not only require expensive 3D supervision in training, but\nalso suffer from generalization issues. As a result, the depth estimations can\nbe erroneous in practice, especially for outdoor unbounded scenes. In this\npaper, we propose to employ view-consistent distributions instead of fixed\ndepth value estimations to regularize NeRF training. Specifically, the\ndistribution is computed by utilizing both low-level color features and\nhigh-level distilled features from foundation models at the projected 2D\npixel-locations from per-ray sampled 3D points. By sampling from the\nview-consistency distributions, an implicit regularization is imposed on the\ntraining of NeRF. We also utilize a depth-pushing loss that works in\nconjunction with the sampling technique to jointly provide effective\nregularizations for eliminating the failure modes.

However, existing methods are limited to\nchallenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information\nand lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic,\nspatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose\nDreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge\nforecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a\nperception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically,\nDreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction,\nintegrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet\ncomprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how\nhumans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning\nchains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and\nsemantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured\nattention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information\nleakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to\nmodel the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a\ndiffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from\nshared latent features.

The main findings show that reducing the training\ndataset size with this method can improve model performance, whereas higher\nredundancy tends to degrade it.

Despite notable success, existing approaches are limited by their\nreliance on sparse slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of\ndiscriminative repre-sentations from gigapixel WSIs. Recently, vision language\n(VL) models, which incorporate additional language supervision, have emerged as\na promising solu-tion. However, VL-based survival prediction remains largely\nunexplored due to two key challenges. First, current methods often rely on only\none simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn\nfine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and\nvisual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment.\nSecond, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking\nthe intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective\nmodeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a\nnovel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved\nsurvival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors\nto generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region\nlevels. At each level, a series of language prompts describing various\nsurvival-related attributes are constructed and aligned with visual features\nvia Optimal Prompt Learning (OPL). This ap-proach enables the comprehensive\nlearning of discriminative visual features cor-responding to different\nsurvival-related attributes from prompts, thereby improv-ing vision-language\nalignment.

In 3D VQA, the\nfree-form nature of answers often leads to improper annotations that can\nconfuse or mislead models when training on the entire dataset. While other text\ngeneration tasks can mitigate this issue by learning on large-scale datasets,\nthe scarcity of 3D scene data enlarges the negative effect of misleading\nannotations. Although active learning strategies can select valuable instances\nfor training, they fail to identify and resolve misleading labels, which the\noracle inevitably provides in practice. To address this issue, we propose a\nmulti-turn interactive active learning strategy. This strategy selects data\nbased on models' semantic uncertainty to form a solid knowledge foundation more\neffectively and actively requests reannotation from an oracle to resolve\npotentially misleading labels.

So far, the labor-intensive\nprocess of collecting clinical data, particularly in acquiring paired 3D\northodontic teeth models, constitutes a crucial bottleneck for developing tooth\narrangement neural networks.

To this end, we first train a\nshadow-independent structure extraction network on a real-world portrait\ndataset with various synthetic lighting conditions, which allows to generate a\nshadow-independent structure map including facial details while excluding the\nunwanted shadow boundaries. The structure map is then used as condition to\ntrain a structure-guided inpainting diffusion model for removing shadows in a\ngenerative manner. Finally, to restore the fine-scale details (e.g., eyelashes,\nmoles and spots) that may not be captured by the structure map, we take the\ngradients inside the shadow regions as guidance and train a detail restoration\ndiffusion model to refine the shadow removal result. Extensive experiments on\nthe benchmark datasets show that our method clearly outperforms existing\nmethods, and is effective to avoid previously common issues such as facial\nidentity tampering, shadow residual, color distortion, structure blurring, and\nloss of details.

The core challenge of inverse rendering lies in the\nill-posed disentanglement of geometry, materials, and illumination from 2D\nobservations. Our method addresses this by jointly optimizing three neural\ncomponents: a neural Signed Distance Function (SDF) to represent complex\ngeometry, a spatially-varying neural field for predicting PBR material\nparameters (albedo, roughness, metallic), and an MLP-based model for capturing\nunknown environmental lighting. The key to our approach is a physically-based\ndifferentiable rendering layer that connects these 3D properties to the input\nimages, allowing for end-to-end optimization.

In contrast to the existing channel pruning methods that prune\nchannels only once per layer in a layer-by-layer fashion, our new progressive\nframework iteratively prunes a small number of channels from several selected\nlayers, which consists of a three-step attempting-selecting-pruning pipeline in\neach iteration. In the attempting step, we attempt to prune a pre-defined\nnumber of channels from one layer by using any existing channel pruning methods\nand estimate the accuracy drop for this layer based on the labelled samples in\nthe validation set. In the selecting step, based on the estimated accuracy\ndrops for all layers, we propose a greedy strategy to automatically select a\nset of layers that will lead to less overall accuracy drop after pruning these\nlayers.

On-satellite machine learning (ML) offers a potential\nsolution, by reducing latency associated with transmission of these large data\nvolumes to ground stations, but state-of-the-art models are often too large or\npower-hungry for satellite deployment. Vessel detection using Synthetic\nAperture Radar (SAR) is a critical time-sensitive task for maritime security\nthat exemplifies this challenge.

However, running these models at sufficient resolution for\nlocal-scale risk-assessments is not computationally feasible.

Yet, due to regional\nvariations in climatic processes, these models typically require retraining for\neach geographical area-demanding high-resolution observational data, which is\nunevenly available across the globe. This highlights the need to assess how\nwell these models generalize across geographic regions.

By extracting rich\ntemporal information from video inputs through our proposed 3D-wavelet gating\nand temporal-aware autoencoder, our method achieves 20% improvement in FID on\nthe most challenging datasets over recent SOTA of image-based diffusion models.\nMeanwhile, due to the existence of rich temporal information, our method\nachieves strong performance while having 3times fewer parameters. Such a\nparameter reduction results in 2.3x speed up. By incorporating optical flow\nguidance, our method requires 9000x less training data and achieves over 20x\nfewer parameters than video-based diffusion models.

However, these developments also raise\nsignificant concerns regarding data privacy and copyright. In response,\ntraining data detection has emerged as a critical task for identifying\nunauthorized data usage in model training. To better understand the\nvulnerability of autoregressive image generative models to such detection, we\nconduct the first study applying membership inference to this domain. Our\napproach comprises two key components: implicit classification and an adaptive\nscore aggregation strategy. First, we compute the implicit token-wise\nclassification score within the query image. Then we propose an adaptive score\naggregation strategy to acquire a final score, which places greater emphasis on\nthe tokens with lower scores. A higher final score indicates that the sample is\nmore likely to be involved in the training set. To validate the effectiveness\nof our method, we adapt existing detection algorithms originally designed for\nLLMs to visual autoregressive models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method in both class-conditional and text-to-image\nscenarios.

Recently,\nDeepSeek-R1 demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire\nreasoning abilities through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) without\nrequiring CoT annotations.

The proposed method\nincorporates architectural enhancements, including feature enhancement modules\nand normalization techniques, aiming to improve the fidelity and physiological\nplausibility of generated images. The study evaluates the performance of the\nframework against existing generative models, demonstrating its capability to\nproduce high-quality fUS images under various experimental conditions.\nAdditionally, the synthesized images are assessed for their utility in\ndownstream tasks, showing improvements in classification accuracy when used for\ndata augmentation. Experimental results are based on publicly available fUS\ndatasets, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in addressing data\nlimitations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eGAN\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u8d85\u58f0\uff08fUS\uff09\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u903c\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u751f\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u8d85\u58f0\uff08fUS\uff09\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6f5c\u529b\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GAN\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f18\u5316fUS\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684fUS\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86fUS\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose SecureT2I,\na secure framework designed to prevent unauthorized editing in diffusion-based\ngenerative models. SecureT2I is compatible with both general-purpose and\ndomain-specific models and can be integrated via lightweight fine-tuning\nwithout architectural changes. We categorize images into a permit set and a\nforbid set based on editing permissions. For the permit set, the model learns\nto perform high-quality manipulations as usual. For the forbid set, we\nintroduce training objectives that encourage vague or semantically ambiguous\noutputs (e.g., blurred images), thereby suppressing meaningful edits. The core\nchallenge is to block unauthorized editing while preserving editing quality for\npermitted inputs. To this end, we design separate loss functions that guide\nselective editing behavior.

However, the collected data often exhibits incomplete and\nmisaligned characteristics due to factors such as inconsistent sensor\nfrequencies and device malfunctions. Existing research has not effectively\naddressed the issue of filling missing data in scenarios where multiview data\nare both imbalanced and misaligned. Instead, it relies on class-level alignment\nof the available data. Thus, it results in some data samples not being\nwell-matched, thereby affecting the quality of data fusion. In this paper, we\npropose the Consistency-Aware Padding for Incomplete Multimodal Alignment\nClustering Based on Self-Repellent Greedy Anchor Search(CAPIMAC) to tackle the\nproblem of filling imbalanced and misaligned data in multimodal datasets.\nSpecifically, we propose a self-repellent greedy anchor search module(SRGASM),\nwhich employs a self-repellent random walk combined with a greedy algorithm to\nidentify anchor points for re-representing incomplete and misaligned multimodal\ndata.

Its common\nsolution is to use a generator to synthesize fake data and use them as a\nsubstitute for real ID data. However, existing works typically assume teachers\nare trustworthy, leaving the robustness and security of DFKD from untrusted\nteachers largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first investigation\ninto distilling non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers using DFKD, where the\ntransferability from an ID domain to an out-of-distribution (OOD) domain is\nprohibited. We find that NTL teachers fool DFKD through divert the generator's\nattention from the useful ID knowledge to the misleading OOD knowledge. This\nhinders ID knowledge transfer but prioritizes OOD knowledge transfer. To\nmitigate this issue, we propose Adversarial Trap Escaping (ATEsc) to benefit\nDFKD by identifying and filtering out OOD-like synthetic samples.

Here, $(X,Y)$ represents the pair of random variables\ncorresponding to the input data and its ground truth label, respectively.\nObserving that the required contextual information scales with IPC, we propose\nmaximizing $\\mathrm{I}(X;Y) + \\beta \\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ during the DM sampling\nprocess, where $\\beta$ is IPC-dependent. Since directly computing\n$\\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$ and $\\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ is intractable, we develop\nvariational estimations to tightly lower-bound these quantities via a\ndata-driven approach. Our approach, information-guided diffusion sampling\n(IGDS), seamlessly integrates with diffusion models and improves dataset\ndistillation across all IPC settings. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet\nsubsets show that IGDS significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly\nin low-IPC regimes. The code will be released upon acceptance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08IGDS\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6700\u5927\u5316\u539f\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f4eIPC\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4f4eIPC\uff08\u6bcf\u7c7b\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\uff09\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6837\u672c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u6700\u5927\u5316\u539f\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\uff08I(X;Y)\uff09\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff08H(X|Y)\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51faIGDS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u4f30\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728Tiny ImageNet\u548cImageNet\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cIGDS\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f4eIPC\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u3002", "conclusion": "IGDS\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f4eIPC\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u3002"}}

Some\nexisting methods can reconstruct skeletal structures and Computed Tomography\n(CT) volumes, they often yield incomplete bone geometry, imprecise tissue\nboundaries, and a lack of anatomical realism, thereby limiting their clinical\nutility in scenarios such as surgical planning and postoperative assessment. In\nthis study, we introduce SPIDER, a novel supervised framework designed to\nreconstruct CT volumes from biplanar X-ray images. SPIDER incorporates tissue\nstructure as prior (e.g., anatomical segmentation) into an implicit neural\nrepresentation decoder in the form of joint supervision through a unified\nencoder-decoder architecture. This design enables the model to jointly learn\nimage intensities and anatomical structures in a pixel-aligned fashion. To\naddress the challenges posed by sparse input and structural ambiguity, SPIDER\ndirectly embeds anatomical constraints into the reconstruction process, thereby\nenhancing structural continuity and reducing soft-tissue artifacts. We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments on clinical head CT datasets and show that SPIDER\ngenerates anatomically accurate reconstructions from only two projections.\nFurthermore, our approach demonstrates strong potential in downstream\nsegmentation tasks, underscoring its utility in personalized treatment planning\nand image-guided surgical navigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPIDER\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u53cc\u5e73\u9762X\u5c04\u7ebf\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efaCT\u4f53\u79ef\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cc\u5e73\u9762X\u5c04\u7ebf\u6210\u50cf\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b58\u57283D\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u5931\u548c\u8f6f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9aa8\u9abc\u7ed3\u6784\u548cCT\u4f53\u79ef\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "SPIDER\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165\u89e3\u5256\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7ed3\u6784\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5934\u90e8CT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSPIDER\u4ec5\u9700\u4e24\u4e2a\u6295\u5f71\u5373\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "SPIDER\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6cbb\u7597\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u624b\u672f\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

In this\nstudy we evaluate the relationship between this metric and the improvement\nwhich synthetic images, generated by a Progressively Growing Generative\nAdversarial Network (PGGAN), grant when augmenting Diabetes-related Macular\nEdema (DME) intraretinal fluid segmentation performed by a U-Net model with\nlimited amounts of training data. We find that the behaviour of augmenting with\nstandard and synthetic images agrees with previously conducted experiments.\nAdditionally, we show that dissimilar (high FID) datasets do not improve\nsegmentation significantly. As FID between the training and augmenting datasets\ndecreases, the augmentation datasets are shown to contribute to significant and\nrobust improvements in image segmentation. Finally, we find that there is\nsignificant evidence to suggest that synthetic and standard augmentations\nfollow separate log-normal trends between FID and improvements in model\nperformance, with synthetic data proving more effective than standard\naugmentation techniques.

Experimental results demonstrate that\nour method generates higher-resolution outputs with improved control over\nviewing angles. This capability has significant implications not only for\nclinical applications but also for medical education and data extension,\nenabling the creation of diverse, high-quality datasets for training and\nanalysis.

Automatic methods, especially data-driven\nmethods for cardiac phase detection, typically require extensive annotations,\nwhich is time-consuming and labor-intensive.

Our method eliminates the need for\nmanual annotations, including ED and ES indices, segmentation, or volumetric\nmeasurements, by training a reconstruction model to encode interpretable\nspatiotemporal motion patterns. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic benchmark, the\napproach achieves mean absolute error (MAE) of 3 frames (58.3 ms) for ED and 2\nframes (38.8 ms) for ES detection, matching state-of-the-art supervised\nmethods. Extended to fetal echocardiography, the model demonstrates robust\nperformance with MAE 1.46 frames (20.7 ms) for ED and 1.74 frames (25.3 ms) for\nES, despite the fact that the fetal heart model is built using non-standardized\nheart views due to fetal heart positioning variability.

This dataset comprises 621 wrist conventional\nradiographs of 227 patients from four medical centers, with pixel-level\ninstance segmentation annotations for 443 images and SvdH BE scores for 548\nimages. This dataset can potentially support a wide range of research tasks\nrelated to RA, including joint space narrowing (JSN) progression\nquantification, BE detection, bone deformity evaluation, and osteophyte\ndetection. It may also be applied to other wrist-related tasks, such as carpal\nbone fracture localization.
