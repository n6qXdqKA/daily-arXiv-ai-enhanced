Accurate deformation modeling\nis essential to maintain the reliability of AR overlays by ensuring alignment\nbetween preoperative models and the dynamically changing anatomy. Although the\nfinite element method (FEM) offers physically plausible modeling, its high\ncomputational cost limits intraoperative applicability. Moreover, existing\nalgorithms often fail to handle large anatomical changes, such as those induced\nby pneumoperitoneum or ligament dissection, leading to inaccurate anatomical\ncorrespondences and compromised AR guidance. To address these challenges, we\npropose a data-driven biomechanics algorithm that preserves FEM-level accuracy\nwhile improving computational efficiency. In addition, we introduce a novel\nhuman-in-the-loop mechanism into the deformation modeling process. This enables\nsurgeons to interactively provide prompts to correct anatomical misalignments,\nthereby incorporating clinical expertise and allowing the model to adapt\ndynamically to complex surgical scenarios. Experiments on a publicly available\ndataset demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a mean target registration\nerror of 3.42 mm. Incorporating surgeon prompts through the interactive\nframework further reduces the error to 2.78 mm, surpassing state-of-the-art\nmethods in volumetric accuracy.

Additionally, we introduce sparsity and smoothness regularization to\ndisambiguate sub-bin ambiguities that arise at fine range resolutions.\nExperimental results show that SpINRv2 significantly outperforms both classical\nand learning-based baselines, especially under high-frequency regimes,\nestablishing a new benchmark for neural radar-based 3D imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "SpINRv2\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4f53\u79ef\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u9891\u7387\u8c03\u5236\u8fde\u7eed\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u9891\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u6df7\u53e0\u548c\u5b50\u533a\u95f4\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u96f7\u8fbe\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u4f4d\u6df7\u53e0\u548c\u5b50\u533a\u95f4\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u3002SpINRv2\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u5fae\u7684\u9891\u7387\u57df\u524d\u5411\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff08INR\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u79ef\u573a\u666f\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u5b50\u533a\u95f4\u6a21\u7cca\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSpINRv2\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u96f7\u8fbe3D\u6210\u50cf\u8bbe\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "SpINRv2\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u57df\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u9891\u96f7\u8fbe\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u65b0\u6807\u6746\u3002"}}

In this work, we analyze this phenomenon and\nidentify that it stems from the premature exposure to high-frequency details in\nthe input image, which biases the sampling process toward a shortcut trajectory\nthat overfits to the static appearance of the reference image. To address this,\nwe propose adaptive low-pass guidance (ALG), a simple fix to the I2V model\nsampling procedure to generate more dynamic videos without compromising\nper-frame image quality. Specifically, ALG adaptively modulates the frequency\ncontent of the conditioning image by applying low-pass filtering at the early\nstage of denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ALG significantly\nimproves the temporal dynamics of generated videos, while preserving image\nfidelity and text alignment.

To resolve this issue, we propose a universal context-aware\ncontrastive learning framework (UniCaCLF) for TFL. Our approach leverages\nsupervised contrastive learning to discover and identify forged instants by\nmeans of anomaly detection, allowing for the precise localization of temporal\nforged segments. To this end, we propose a novel context-aware perception layer\nthat utilizes a heterogeneous activation operation and an adaptive context\nupdater to construct a context-aware contrastive objective, which enhances the\ndiscriminability of forged instant features by contrasting them with genuine\ninstant features in terms of their distances to the global context. An\nefficient context-aware contrastive coding is introduced to further push the\nlimit of instant feature distinguishability between genuine and forged instants\nin a supervised sample-by-sample manner, suppressing the cross-sample influence\nto improve temporal forgery localization performance. Extensive experimental\nresults over five public datasets demonstrate that our proposed UniCaCLF\nsignificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competing algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff08UniCaCLF\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u90e8\u5206\u7247\u6bb5\u88ab\u7be1\u6539\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4f2a\u9020\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff08TFL\uff09\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5c06\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u89c6\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u90e8\u5206\u7247\u6bb5\u88ab\u7be1\u6539\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u800cTFL\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bc6\u522b\u4f2a\u9020\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u611f\u77e5\u5c42\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u66f4\u65b0\u5668\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4f2a\u9020\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u7247\u6bb5\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cUniCaCLF\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "UniCaCLF\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u4f2a\u9020\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Out of these\ndifficulties, a visual interpretation of imagery showing marine debris remains\na common practice by domain experts, who select bands and spectral indices on a\ncase-by-case basis informed by common practices and heuristics. SAMSelect\nselects the band or index combination that achieves the best classification\naccuracy on a small annotated dataset through the Segment Anything Model. Its\ncentral assumption is that the three-channel visualization achieves the most\naccurate segmentation results also provide good visual information for\nphoto-interpretation.\n  We evaluate SAMSelect in three Sentinel-2 scenes containing generic marine\ndebris in Accra, Ghana, and Durban, South Africa, and deployed plastic targets\nfrom the Plastic Litter Project. This reveals the potential of new previously\nunused band combinations (e.g., a normalized difference index of B8, B2), which\ndemonstrate improved performance compared to literature-based indices.

Recent learning\nmethods are either single-object representations with small neural models that\nallow for high surface details but require per-object training or generalized\nrepresentations that require larger models and generalize to newer shapes but\nlack details, and inference is slow. We propose a new implicit representation\nfor general 3D shapes that is faster than all the baselines at their optimum\nresolution, with only a marginal loss in performance compared to the\nstate-of-the-art. We achieve the best accuracy-speed trade-off using three key\ncontributions. Many implicit methods extract features from the point cloud to\nclassify whether a query point is inside or outside the object.

However, multitask\nlearning faces challenges such as task balancing, requiring careful adjustment\nof data proportions, and expansion costs, where new tasks risk catastrophic\nforgetting and need costly retraining. Continual learning provides a promising\nalternative to acquiring new knowledge incrementally while preserving existing\ncapabilities.

Existing methods typically partition\nlarge scenes into multiple regions, reconstruct a 3D representation using\nGaussian splatting for each region, and eventually merge them for novel view\nrendering.

AAAs may rupture, with a survival rate of only 20\\%. Current\nclinical guidelines recommend elective surgical repair when the maximum AAA\ndiameter exceeds 55 mm in men or 50 mm in women.

Although a straight-line\nconnection between the noisy and natural data distributions is intuitive, fast,\nand easy to optimize, it still inevitably leads to: 1) Diversity concerns,\nwhich arise since straight-line paths only cover a fairly restricted sampling\nspace. 2) Multi-scale noise modeling concerns, since the straight line flow\nonly needs to optimize the constant velocity field $\\bm v$ between the two\ndistributions $\\bm\\pi_0$ and $\\bm\\pi_1$. In this work, we present\nDiscretized-RF, a new family of rectified flow (also called momentum flow\nmodels since they refer to the previous velocity component and the random\nvelocity component in each diffusion step), which discretizes the straight path\ninto a series of variable velocity field sub-paths (namely ``momentum fields'')\nto expand the search space, especially when close to the distribution\n$p_\\text{noise}$. Different from the previous case where noise is directly\nsuperimposed on $\\bm x$, we introduce noise on the velocity $\\bm v$ of the\nsub-path to change its direction in order to improve the diversity and\nmulti-scale noise modeling abilities.

While CLIP is focused\non image-level vision-language matching, video-text retrieval demands\ncomprehensive understanding at the video level. Three key discrepancies emerge\nin the transfer from image-level to video-level: vision, language, and\nalignment. However, existing methods mainly focus on vision while neglecting\nlanguage and alignment. In this paper, we propose Discrepancy Reduction in\nVision, Language, and Alignment (DiscoVLA), which simultaneously mitigates all\nthree discrepancies. Specifically, we introduce Image-Video Features Fusion to\nintegrate image-level and video-level features, effectively tackling both\nvision and language discrepancies. Additionally, we generate pseudo image\ncaptions to learn fine-grained image-level alignment. To mitigate alignment\ndiscrepancies, we propose Image-to-Video Alignment Distillation, which\nleverages image-level alignment knowledge to enhance video-level alignment.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our DiscoVLA.

Extensive experiments on five open-environment tasks:\nclass-incremental learning, few-shot open-set recognition, few-shot learning,\nzero-shot learning, and general image classification, demonstrate that our\nmethod effectively enhances the performance of hyperbolic algorithms in\nopen-environment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u66f2\u53cc\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u53cc\u66f2\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53cc\u66f2\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5c01\u95ed\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u672a\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecfODE\u6a21\u5757\u4f30\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\uff1b2. \u5f15\u5165\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4fdd\u6301\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b3. \u63a8\u5bfc\u635f\u5931\u4e0a\u754c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u9650\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u79cd\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u53cc\u66f2\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, the underlying computational\nredundancy involved in these steps has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In\nthis paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the VAR inference process and\nidentify two primary sources of inefficiency: step redundancy and unconditional\nbranch redundancy. To address step redundancy, we propose an automatic\nstep-skipping strategy that selectively omits unnecessary generation steps to\nimprove efficiency. For unconditional branch redundancy, we observe that the\ninformation gap between the conditional and unconditional branches is minimal.\nLeveraging this insight, we introduce unconditional branch replacement, a\ntechnique that bypasses the unconditional branch to reduce computational cost.\nNotably, we observe that the effectiveness of acceleration strategies varies\nsignificantly across different samples. Motivated by this, we propose SkipVAR,\na sample-adaptive framework that leverages frequency information to dynamically\nselect the most suitable acceleration strategy for each instance.

Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed method for semi-supervised medical\nimage segmentation on two multi-label datasets, i.e., ACDC and BHSD. Notably,\nSSS achieves an average Dice score of 53.15 on BHSD, surpassing the previous\nstate-of-the-art method by +3.65 Dice.

To mitigate the effect of low-quality\nsegmentation masks, we introduce a series of strategies for pseudo-label\ngeneration, storage, and supervision.

Additionally, to tackle the issue of intrinsic\nsimilarity, we design a hybrid-granularity feature grouping module that groups\nfeatures at different granularities and aggregates these results.

In contrast, although the models pretrained via multimodal masked\nmodeling struggle with direct cross-modal matching, they excel in visual\nrepresentation.

Concept\nreplacement techniques (CRTs) aim to address this challenge, often by trying to\n\"erase\" unacceptable concepts from models. Recently, model providers have\nstarted offering image editing services which accept an image and a text prompt\nas input, to produce an image altered as specified by the prompt. These are\nknown as image-to-image (I2I) models. In this paper, we first use an I2I model\nto empirically demonstrate that today's state-of-the-art CRTs do not in fact\nerase unacceptable concepts. Existing CRTs are thus likely to be ineffective in\nemerging I2I scenarios, despite their proven ability to remove unwanted\nconcepts in T2I pipelines, highlighting the need to understand this discrepancy\nbetween T2I and I2I settings. Next, we argue that a good CRT, while replacing\nunacceptable concepts, should preserve other concepts specified in the inputs\nto generative models. We call this fidelity.

However, these methods are\ninherently limited by the short perception range of onboard sensors. To\novercome this limitation and improve general performance, recent approaches\nhave explored the use of standard definition (SD) maps as prior, which are\nsignificantly easier to maintain.

In this\nway, we enrich SD vector map tokens with NLP-derived features, eliminating the\ndependency on predefined specifications or exhaustive class taxonomies.

Effective OOD detection after deployment could benefit\nfrom access to the training data, enabling direct comparison between test\nsamples and the training data distribution to identify differences.\nState-of-the-art OOD detection methods, however, either discard training data\nafter deployment or assume that test samples and training data are centrally\nstored together, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world settings.

This results in three key limitations: (1) an\ninability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that\ncaptions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain\nvision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result,\ncurrent LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially\noverlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have\nexplored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive\nvisual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In\nthis paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR),\nwhich enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified\nautoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw\nvisual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal\nunderstanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic\nrepresentation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find\nthat even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can\neffectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and\nconsistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding\nbenchmarks. Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying\ndata scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones.

However, existing preference optimization approaches for LMMs\ndo not focus on restraining the internal biases of their Large Language Model\n(LLM) backbones when curating the training data.

UniVarFL leverages two complementary regularization strategies\nduring local training: Classifier Variance Regularization, which aligns\nclass-wise probability distributions with those expected under IID conditions,\neffectively mitigating local classifier bias; and Hyperspherical Uniformity\nRegularization, which encourages a uniform distribution of feature\nrepresentations across the hypersphere, thereby enhancing the model's ability\nto generalize under diverse data distributions. Extensive experiments on\nmultiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that UniVarFL outperforms existing\nmethods in accuracy, highlighting its potential as a highly scalable and\nefficient solution for real-world FL deployments, especially in\nresource-constrained settings.

The surveys assessed\ndemographics, AI awareness, expectations, involvement, and ethics (2024 only).\nThe surveys collected a total of 671 responses from 98 countries, 522 in 2021\nand 149 in 2024. Awareness of AI courses rose from 14.5% in 2021 to 44.6% in\n2024, while course attendance increased from 12.9% to 23%. Despite this,\nfamiliarity with foundational AI concepts remained limited. Expectations for\nAI's role shifted in 2024, with hospital management gaining relevance. Ethical\nconcerns gained prominence, with 87.2% of 2024 participants emphasizing\naccountability and transparency. Infrastructure limitations remained the\nprimary obstacle to implementation. Interdisciplinary collaboration and\nstructured training were identified as critical for successful AI adoption.\nOptimism about AI's transformative potential remained high, with 79.9% of\nrespondents believing AI would positively impact surgery and 96.6% willing to\nintegrate AI into their clinical practice. Surgeons' perceptions of AI are\nevolving, driven by the rise of generative AI and advancements in surgical data\nscience. While enthusiasm for integration is strong, knowledge gaps and\ninfrastructural challenges persist. Addressing these through education, ethical\nframeworks, and infrastructure development is essential.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc72021\u548c2024\u5e74\u7684\u5168\u7403\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5916\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u5bf9AI\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u3001\u671f\u671b\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0AI\u8bfe\u7a0b\u610f\u8bc6\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u7840\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u5728\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5916\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u671f\u671b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc72021\u548c2024\u5e74\u7684\u4e24\u6b21\u5168\u7403\u6027\u6a2a\u65ad\u9762\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5916\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u5bf9AI\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u3001\u671f\u671b\u3001\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "AI\u8bfe\u7a0b\u610f\u8bc6\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u7840\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ecd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u53d7\u91cd\u89c6\uff1b\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\uff1b\u5916\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u5bf9AI\u6301\u4e50\u89c2\u6001\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u5728\u5916\u79d1\u9886\u57df\u6f5c\u529b\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u80b2\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u89e3\u51b3\u77e5\u8bc6\u5dee\u8ddd\u548c\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

More recently, instruction-tuned multimodal models have shown to\ngenerate task-specific representations that align strongly with brain activity.\nHowever, prior work evaluating the brain alignment of MLLMs has primarily\nfocused on unimodal settings or relied on non-instruction-tuned multimodal\nmodels for multimodal stimuli. To address this gap, we investigated brain\nalignment, that is, measuring the degree of predictivity of neural activity\nrecorded while participants were watching naturalistic movies (video along with\naudio) with representations derived from MLLMs. We utilized\ninstruction-specific embeddings from six video and two audio instruction-tuned\nMLLMs. Experiments with 13 video task-specific instructions show that\ninstruction-tuned video MLLMs significantly outperform non-instruction-tuned\nmultimodal (by 15%) and unimodal models (by 20%). Our evaluation of MLLMs for\nboth video and audio tasks using language-guided instructions shows clear\ndisentanglement in task-specific representations from MLLMs, leading to precise\ndifferentiation of multimodal functional processing in the brain. We also find\nthat MLLM layers align hierarchically with the brain, with early sensory areas\nshowing strong alignment with early layers, while higher-level visual and\nlanguage regions align more with middle to late layers.

Its ability to safeguard privacy,\nat the heart of FL, has recently been a hot-button debate topic. To elaborate,\nseveral studies have introduced a type of attacks known as gradient leakage\nattacks (GLAs), which exploit the gradients shared during training to\nreconstruct clients' raw data. On the flip side, some literature, however,\ncontends no substantial privacy risk in practical FL environments due to the\neffectiveness of such GLAs being limited to overly relaxed conditions, such as\nsmall batch sizes and knowledge of clients' data distributions.\n  This paper bridges this critical gap by empirically demonstrating that\nclients' data can still be effectively reconstructed, even within realistic FL\nenvironments. Upon revisiting GLAs, we recognize that their performance\nfailures stem from their inability to handle the gradient matching problem. To\nalleviate the performance bottlenecks identified above, we develop FedLeak,\nwhich introduces two novel techniques, partial gradient matching and gradient\nregularization. Moreover, to evaluate the performance of FedLeak in real-world\nFL environments, we formulate a practical evaluation protocol grounded in a\nthorough review of extensive FL literature and industry practices.

Third, personalized feedback is generated using AI,\nsynthesizing human-based evaluations and data-based multimodal insights such as\nposture, speech patterns, stress levels, and cognitive load, among others.\nFinally, students review their own performance through video recordings and\nengage in self-assessment and feedback visualization, comparing their own\nevaluations with peers and professors' assessments, class averages, and\nAI-generated recommendations. By combining human-based and data-based\nevaluation techniques, this framework enables more accurate, personalized and\nactionable feedback.

Diffusion models have shown breakthrough results in\nrealistic image generation, yet few studies have focused on mammograms, and\nnone have successfully generated high-resolution outputs required to capture\nfine-grained features of small lesions. To achieve this, MAMBO integrates\nseparate diffusion models to capture both local and global (image-level)\ncontexts. The contextual information is then fed into the final patch-based\nmodel, significantly aiding the noise removal process. This thoughtful design\nenables MAMBO to generate highly realistic mammograms of up to 3840x3840\npixels. Importantly, this approach can be used to enhance the training of\nclassification models and extended to anomaly detection.

Our sensitivity analysis shows that its\nseparability properties are stable provided the Wasserstein-infinity distance\nbetween the samples can be controlled. Since the Wasserstein-infinity distance\nonly allows small local image deformations, we moreover introduce a\nmean-normalized version of the R-CDT.
