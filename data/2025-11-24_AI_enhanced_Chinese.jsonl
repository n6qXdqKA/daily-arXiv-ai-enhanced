Traditionally, identifying artistic styles has been the job of art historians or critics, relying on visual intuition and experience.

In this work, we show how persistent homology (PH), a method from topological data analysis, provides objective and interpretable insights on artistic styles. We show how PH can, with statistical certainty, differentiate between artists, both from different artistic currents and from the same one, and distinguish images of an artist from an AI-generated image in the artist's style.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6301\u7eed\u540c\u8c03(PH)\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u89d2\u5ea6\u5ba2\u89c2\u533a\u5206\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u5730\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u3001\u540c\u4e00\u6d41\u6d3e\u5185\u7684\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u4f5c\u54c1\u4e0eAI\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u4eff\u4f5c\u54c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u8bc6\u522b\u4f9d\u8d56\u827a\u672f\u53f2\u5b66\u5bb6\u6216\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u76f4\u89c9\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5ba2\u89c2\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6570\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\u63a2\u7d22\u827a\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u540c\u8c03(PH)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "PH\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u7684\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e0d\u540c\u827a\u672f\u6d41\u6d3e\u4e4b\u95f4\u548c\u540c\u4e00\u6d41\u6d3e\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u771f\u5b9e\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u4f5c\u54c1\u4e0eAI\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u4eff\u4f5c\u54c1\u7684\u533a\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6301\u7eed\u540c\u8c03\u4e3a\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8865\u5145\u4f20\u7edf\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u4ef7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u827a\u672f\u9274\u5b9a\u548cAI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

In this study, we focus on macaque monkeys, widely studied in systems neuroscience and evolutionary research, and propose a method to generate their facial expressions using a style-based generative image model (i.e., StyleGAN2). To address data limitations, we implemented: 1) data augmentation by synthesizing new facial expression images using a motion transfer to animate still images with computer graphics, 2) sample selection based on the latent representation of macaque faces from an initially trained StyleGAN2 model to ensure the variation and uniform sampling in training dataset, and 3) loss function refinement to ensure the accurate reproduction of subtle movements, such as eye movements. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method enables the generation of diverse facial expressions for multiple macaque individuals, outperforming models trained solely on original still images. Additionally, we show that our model is effective for style-based image editing, where specific style parameters correspond to distinct facial movements. These findings underscore the model's potential for disentangling motion components as style parameters, providing a valuable tool for research on macaque facial expressions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528StyleGAN2\u751f\u6210\u7315\u7334\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u7269\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u53d8\u5316\u4e0a\u90fd\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u8fdb\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7315\u7334\u3002", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f6c\u79fb\u6280\u672f\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u56fe\u5f62\u5b66\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u6dfb\u52a0\u52a8\u753b\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u521d\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684StyleGAN2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\uff1b3) \u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u51c6\u786e\u518d\u73b0\u7ec6\u5fae\u8fd0\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u773c\u7403\u8fd0\u52a8\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u7315\u7334\u4e2a\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u539f\u59cb\u9759\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u9762\u4e5f\u5f88\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u98ce\u683c\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u5c06\u8fd0\u52a8\u6210\u5206\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u98ce\u683c\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7315\u7334\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, images of neutron sources are often degraded by various types of noise. Most commonly, Gaussian and Poisson noise often coexist within one image, obscuring fine details and blurring edges. These noise types often overlap, making them difficult to distinguish and remove using conventional filtering and thresholding methods. As a result, noise removal techniques that preserve image fidelity are important for analyzing and interpreting images of a neutron source. Current solutions include a combination of filtering and thresholding methodologies. In the past, machine learning approaches were rarely implemented due to a lack of ground truth neutron imaging data for ICF processes. However, recent advances in synthetic data production, particularly in the fusion imaging field, have opened opportunities to investigate new denoising procedures using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. In this study, we implement an unsupervised autoencoder with a Cohen-Daubechies- Feauveau (CDF 97) wavelet transform in the latent space for mixed Gaussian-Poisson denoising. The network successfully denoises neutron imaging data. Additionally, it demonstrates lower reconstruction error and superior edge preservation metrics when benchmarked with data generated by a forward model and compared to non-ML-based filtering mechanisms such as Block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D).

We find this trade-off stems from rigid alignment strategies that force unsafe concepts toward single, predefined safe targets, disrupting the model's learned semantic structure. To address this, we propose a proximity-aware approach: redirecting unsafe concepts to their semantically closest safe alternatives to minimize representational change. We introduce SaFeR-CLIP, a fine-tuning framework that applies this principle of minimal intervention. SaFeR-CLIP successfully reconciles safety and performance, recovering up to 8.0% in zero-shot accuracy over prior methods while maintaining robust safety. To support more rigorous evaluation, we also contribute NSFW-Caps, a new benchmark of 1,000 highly-aligned pairs for testing safety under distributional shift.

However, for single object SVGs, generating multi-view consistent SVGs from a single-view input remains underexplored. We present a three stage framework that produces multi-view SVGs with geometric and color consistency from a single SVG input. First, the rasterized input is lifted to a 3D representation and rendered under target camera poses, producing multi-view images of the object. Next, we extend the temporal memory mechanism of Segment Anything 2 (SAM2) to the spatial domain, constructing a spatial memory bank that establishes part level correspondences across neighboring views, yielding cleaner and more consistent vector paths and color assignments without retraining. Finally, during the raster to vector conversion, we perform path consolidation and structural optimization to reduce redundancy while preserving boundaries and semantics. The resulting SVGs exhibit strong geometric and color consistency across views, significantly reduce redundant paths, and retain fine structural details.

However, current methods to enhance quality typically rely on larger models or longer sequences that result in longer generation time, and their inherent sequential nature imposes a severe quality-speed trade-off. This sequential dependency also significantly complicates incremental editing. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mesh RAG, a novel, training-free, plug-and-play framework for autoregressive mesh generation models. Inspired by RAG for language models, our approach augments the generation process by leveraging point cloud segmentation, spatial transformation, and point cloud registration to retrieve, generate, and integrate mesh components. This retrieval-based approach decouples generation from its strict sequential dependency, facilitating efficient and parallelizable inference. We demonstrate the wide applicability of Mesh RAG across various foundational autoregressive mesh generation models, showing it significantly enhances mesh quality, accelerates generation speed compared to sequential part prediction, and enables incremental editing, all without model retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "Mesh RAG\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u81ea\u56de\u5f523D\u7f51\u683c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5e8f\u5217\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8d28\u91cf-\u901f\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf3D\u7f51\u683c\u624b\u52a8\u521b\u5efa\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u901f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u589e\u91cf\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684RAG\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u70b9\u4e91\u5206\u5272\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u6280\u672f\u6765\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u7f51\u683c\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "Mesh RAG\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7f51\u683c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5e8f\u5217\u90e8\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u589e\u91cf\u7f16\u8f91\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "Mesh RAG\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7f51\u683c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u589e\u91cf\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

The use of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) has driven major advances in this recognition task. In real-world scenarios, the captured skeletons are not always perfect or complete because of occlusions of parts of the human body or poor communication quality, leading to missing parts in skeletons or videos with missing frames. In the presence of such non-idealities, existing GCN models perform poorly due to missing local context. To address this limitation, we propose Parts-Mamba, a hybrid GCN-Mamba model designed to enhance the ability to capture and maintain contextual information from distant joints. The proposed Parts-Mamba model effectively captures part-specific information through its parts-specific scanning feature and preserves non-neighboring joint context via a parts-body fusion module.

In this work, we extend this idea to inverse problems, where pretrained generative models are employed as priors. We propose applying representation alignment (REPA) between diffusion or flow-based models and a pretrained self-supervised visual encoder, such as DINOv2, to guide the reconstruction process at inference time. Although ground-truth signals are unavailable in inverse problems, we show that aligning model representations with approximate target features can substantially enhance reconstruction fidelity and perceptual realism. We provide theoretical results showing (a) the relation between the REPA regularization and a divergence measure in the DINOv2 embedding space, and (b) how REPA updates steer the model's internal representations toward those of the clean image. These results offer insights into the role of REPA in improving perceptual fidelity.

These characteristics make glass surface detection a challenging computer vision task. Existing glass surface detection methods always rely on boundary cues (e.g., window and door frames) or reflection cues to locate glass surfaces, but they fail to fully exploit the intrinsic properties of the glass itself for accurate localization. We observed that in most real-world scenes, the illumination intensity in front of the glass surface differs from that behind it, which results in variations in the reflections visible on the glass surface. Specifically, when standing on the brighter side of the glass and applying a flash towards the darker side, existing reflections on the glass surface tend to disappear. Conversely, while standing on the darker side and applying a flash towards the brighter side, distinct reflections will appear on the glass surface. Based on this phenomenon, we propose NFGlassNet, a novel method for glass surface detection that leverages the reflection dynamics present in flash/no-flash imagery. Specifically, we propose a Reflection Contrast Mining Module (RCMM) for extracting reflections, and a Reflection Guided Attention Module (RGAM) for fusing features from reflection and glass surface for accurate glass surface detection. For learning our network, we also construct a dataset consisting of 3.3K no-flash and flash image pairs captured from various scenes with corresponding ground truth annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

To bridge this gap, we firstly introduce R-AVST, a dataset for audio-visual reasoning featuring fine-grained spatio-temporal annotations. In constructing this, we design a pipeline consisting of LLM-based key object extraction, automatic spatial annotation and manual quality inspection, resulting in over 5K untrimmed videos with 27K objects across 100 types of audio-visual events. Building on this dataset, we define three core tasks for spatio-temporal reasoning in audio-visual scenes and generate more than 8K high-quality, evenly distributed question-answer pairs to effectively benchmark model performance. To further enhance reasoning, we propose AVST-Zero, a reinforcement learning-based model that avoids intermediate supervision, directly optimizing behavior via carefully designed multi-dimensional rewards. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our R-AVST in advancing audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, upon which AVST-Zero demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing models.

While recent studies have explored alternative degradation processes beyond Gaussian noise, this paper bridges two key diffusion paradigms: hot diffusion, which relies entirely on noise, and cold diffusion, which uses only blurring without noise. We argue that hot diffusion fails to exploit the strong correlation between high-frequency image detail and low-frequency structures, leading to random behaviors in the early steps of generation. Conversely, while cold diffusion leverages image correlations for prediction, it neglects the role of noise (randomness) in shaping the data manifold, resulting in out-of-manifold issues and partially explaining its performance drop. To integrate both strengths, we propose Warm Diffusion, a unified Blur-Noise Mixture Diffusion Model (BNMD), to control blurring and noise jointly. Our divide-and-conquer strategy exploits the spectral dependency in images, simplifying score model estimation by disentangling the denoising and deblurring processes. We further analyze the Blur-to-Noise Ratio (BNR) using spectral analysis to investigate the trade-off between model learning dynamics and changes in the data manifold.

However, most existing quality assessment datasets and models provide only a single quality score, which is too coarse to offer targeted guidance for improving generative models. In current applications of AI-generated images, realism and plausibility are two critical dimensions, and with the emergence of unified generation-understanding models, fine-grained evaluation along these dimensions becomes especially effective for improving generative performance. Therefore, we introduce Q-Real, a novel dataset for fine-grained evaluation of realism and plausibility in AI-generated images. Q-Real consists of 3,088 images generated by popular text-to-image models. For each image, we annotate the locations of major entities and provide a set of judgment questions and attribution descriptions for these along the dimensions of realism and plausibility. Considering that recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) enable fine-grained evaluation of AI-generated images, we construct Q-Real Bench to evaluate them on two tasks: judgment and grounding with reasoning. Finally, to enhance MLLM capabilities, we design a fine-tuning framework and conduct experiments on multiple MLLMs using our dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the high quality and significance of our dataset and the comprehensiveness of the benchmark.

Our goal is to achieve unification along three axes: the model, the tasks, and the representations. At the representation level, we eliminate modality discrepancies by mapping both text and images into a shared visual space: textual prompts are rendered as painted text images on a clean canvas, and all inputs and outputs are treated purely as RGB pixels. This yields a fully vision-native formulation of multimodal learning. At the task level, a broad range of vision-language problems are cast as pixel-to-pixel transformations in this visual space. For understanding tasks, the model takes an RGB image and produces a painted text image that visually encodes the semantic prediction. For generation tasks, painted text images serve as visual conditions that guide realistic and semantically aligned image synthesis. Captioning and text-to-image generation thus become different directions of the same underlying visual translation process. At the model level, we instantiate a single Unified Diffusion Transformer trained with rectified flow in pixel space. A shared backbone jointly learns bidirectional mappings between natural images and painted text images, with lightweight task embeddings to specify the desired direction. Experiments on text-to-image synthesis and image-to-text understanding demonstrate strong cross-modal alignment and emergent controllability such as cycle-consistent image-caption-image loops.

We tackle the setting where no real anomaly samples or training are available. We propose Delta-Denoising (DeltaDeno), a training-free zero-shot anomaly generation method that localizes and edits defects by contrasting two diffusion branches driven by a minimal prompt pair under a shared schedule. By accumulating per-step denoising deltas into an image-specific localization map, we obtain a mask to guide the latent inpainting during later diffusion steps and preserve the surrounding context while generating realistic local defects.

However, they suffer from error accumulation, spatial artifacts, and a trade-off between perceptual quality and fidelity, primarily caused by inaccurate alignment and insufficient compensation between video frames. In this paper, within the DM-based VSR pipeline, we revisit the role of alignment and compensation between adjacent video frames and reveal two crucial observations: (a) the feature domain is better suited than the pixel domain for information compensation due to its stronger spatial and temporal correlations, and (b) warping at an upscaled resolution better preserves high-frequency information, but this benefit is not necessarily monotonic. Therefore, we propose a novel Densely Guided diffusion model with Aligned Features for Video Super-Resolution (DGAF-VSR), with an Optical Guided Warping Module (OGWM) to maintain high-frequency details in the aligned features and a Feature-wise Temporal Condition Module (FTCM) to deliver dense guidance in the feature domain. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DGAF-VSR surpasses state-of-the-art methods in key aspects of VSR, including perceptual quality (35.82\\% DISTS reduction), fidelity (0.20 dB PSNR gain), and temporal consistency (30.37\\% tLPIPS reduction).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DGAF-VSR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u5f15\u5bfc\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f2a\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f2a\u5f71\u4ee5\u53ca\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u5e27\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u8865\u507f\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDGAF-VSR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5149\u5b66\u5f15\u5bfc\u53d8\u5f62\u6a21\u5757(OGWM)\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u9f50\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7279\u5f81\u57df\u65f6\u5e8f\u6761\u4ef6\u6a21\u5757(FTCM)\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bc6\u96c6\u5f15\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDGAF-VSR\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf(DISTS\u964d\u4f4e35.82%)\u3001\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6(PSNR\u63d0\u53470.20dB)\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027(tLPIPS\u964d\u4f4e30.37%)\u65b9\u9762\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7279\u5f81\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u5f15\u5bfc\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Current privacy benchmarks are structurally insufficient for this new threat, as they primarily evaluate privacy perception while failing to address the more critical risk of privacy reasoning: a VLM's ability to infer and link distributed information to construct individual profiles. To address this critical gap, we propose \\textbf{MultiPriv}, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate individual-level privacy reasoning in VLMs. We introduce the \\textbf{Privacy Perception and Reasoning (PPR)} framework and construct a novel, bilingual multimodal dataset to support it. The dataset uniquely features a core component of synthetic individual profiles where identifiers (e.g., faces, names) are meticulously linked to sensitive attributes. This design enables nine challenging tasks evaluating the full PPR spectrum, from attribute detection to cross-image re-identification and chained inference. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of over 50 foundational and commercial VLMs. Our analysis reveals: (1) Many VLMs possess significant, unmeasured reasoning-based privacy risks.

Conventional motion-compensated reconstructions typically rely on pre-estimated optical flow, which is inaccurate under undersampling and degrades reconstruction quality. In this work, we propose a novel implicit neural representation (INR) framework that jointly models both the dynamic image sequence and its underlying motion field. Specifically, one INR is employed to parameterize the spatiotemporal image content, while another INR represents the optical flow. The two are coupled via the optical flow equation, which serves as a physics-inspired regularization, in addition to a data consistency loss that enforces agreement with k-space measurements. This joint optimization enables simultaneous recovery of temporally coherent images and motion fields without requiring prior flow estimation. Experiments on dynamic cardiac MRI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art motion-compensated and deep learning approaches, achieving superior reconstruction quality, accurate motion estimation, and improved temporal fidelity. These results highlight the potential of implicit joint modeling with flow-regularized constraints for advancing dMRI reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u6d41\u65b9\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5148\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\u5373\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u6062\u590d\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5e72\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8fd0\u52a8\u8865\u507f\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5148\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5149\u6d41\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6b20\u91c7\u6837\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u6062\u590d\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a(INR)\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65f6\u7a7a\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u8868\u793a\u5149\u6d41\u573a\u3002\u4e24\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u6d41\u65b9\u7a0b\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5fc3\u810fMRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8865\u507f\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u6539\u5584\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u52a8\u6001MRI\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose Fine-grained Finger-level Hand Motion Captioning (FingerCap), which aims to generate textual descriptions that capture detailed finger-level semantics of hand actions. To support this task, we curate FingerCap-40K, a large-scale corpus of 40K paired hand-motion videos and captions spanning two complementary sources: concise instruction-style finger motions and diverse, naturalistic hand-object interactions. To enable effective evaluation, we employ HandJudge, a LLM-based rubric that measures finger-level correctness and motion completeness. Temporal sparsity remains a fundamental bottleneck for current Video-MLLMs, since sparse RGB sampling is insufficient to capture the subtle, high-frequency dynamics underlying fine finger motions. As a simple and compute-friendly remedy, we introduce FiGOP (Finger Group-of-Pictures), which pairs each RGB keyframe with subsequent hand keypoints until the next keyframe. A lightweight temporal encoder converts the keypoints into motion embeddings and integrates them with RGB features. FiGOP adapts the classic GOP concept to finger motion, recovering fine temporal cues without increasing RGB density. Experiments on FingerCap-40K show that strong open- and closed-source Video-MLLMs still struggle with finger-level reasoning, while our FiGOP-augmented model yield consistent gains under HandJudge and human studies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FingerCap\u4efb\u52a1\u548cFiGOP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u624b\u6307\u7ea7\u624b\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408RGB\u5e27\u548c\u624b\u90e8\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u6765\u514b\u670d\u89c6\u9891MLLMs\u5728\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u5fae\u624b\u6307\u8fd0\u52a8\u65f6\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4eba\u7c7b\u624b\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u901a\u4fe1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891MLLMs\u56e0\u65f6\u5e8f\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u624b\u6307\u7ea7\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaFingerCap-40K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165FiGOP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06RGB\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u4e0e\u540e\u7eed\u624b\u90e8\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u914d\u5bf9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65f6\u5e8f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c06\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u5d4c\u5165\u5e76\u4e0eRGB\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728FingerCap-40K\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u89c6\u9891MLLMs\u5728\u624b\u6307\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u4ecd\u6709\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u800cFiGOP\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728HandJudge\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "FiGOP\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u7cbe\u7ec6\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u589e\u52a0RGB\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u624b\u6307\u8fd0\u52a8\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing methods primarily focus on fully-supervised learning and rely on costly, time-consuming temporal boundary annotations. In this paper, we investigate point-supervised facial expression spotting (P-FES), where only a single timestamp annotation per instance is required for training. We propose a unique two-branch framework for P-FES. First, to mitigate the limitation of hard pseudo-labeling, which often confuses neutral and expression frames with various intensities, we propose a Gaussian-based instance-adaptive intensity modeling (GIM) module to model instance-level expression intensity distribution for soft pseudo-labeling. By detecting the pseudo-apex frame around each point label, estimating the duration, and constructing an instance-level Gaussian distribution, GIM assigns soft pseudo-labels to expression frames for more reliable intensity supervision. The GIM module is incorporated into our framework to optimize the class-agnostic expression intensity branch. Second, we design a class-aware apex classification branch that distinguishes macro- and micro-expressions solely based on their pseudo-apex frames. During inference, the two branches work independently: the class-agnostic expression intensity branch generates expression proposals, while the class-aware apex-classification branch is responsible for macro- and micro-expression classification.Furthermore, we introduce an intensity-aware contrastive loss to enhance discriminative feature learning and suppress neutral noise by contrasting neutral frames with expression frames with various intensities.

However, applying it to modern flow matching models is challenging because of its deterministic sampling paradigm. Current methods address this issue by converting Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), which introduce stochasticity. However, this SDE-based GRPO suffers from issues of inefficient credit assignment and incompatibility with high-order solvers for fewer-step sampling. In this paper, we first reinterpret existing SDE-based GRPO methods from a distance optimization perspective, revealing their underlying mechanism as a form of contrastive learning. Based on this insight, we propose Neighbor GRPO, a novel alignment algorithm that completely bypasses the need for SDEs. Neighbor GRPO generates a diverse set of candidate trajectories by perturbing the initial noise conditions of the ODE and optimizes the model using a softmax distance-based surrogate leaping policy. We establish a theoretical connection between this distance-based objective and policy gradient optimization, rigorously integrating our approach into the GRPO framework. Our method fully preserves the advantages of deterministic ODE sampling, including efficiency and compatibility with high-order solvers. We further introduce symmetric anchor sampling for computational efficiency and group-wise quasi-norm reweighting to address reward flattening. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Neighbor GRPO significantly outperforms SDE-based counterparts in terms of training cost, convergence speed, and generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Neighbor GRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6270\u52a8ODE\u521d\u59cb\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5019\u9009\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86SDE\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u3001\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eSDE-based\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684SDE-based GRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u4e0e\u9ad8\u9636\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6270\u52a8ODE\u521d\u59cb\u566a\u58f0\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8esoftmax\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u8df3\u8dc3\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u79f0\u951a\u70b9\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u7ec4\u5185\u51c6\u8303\u6570\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eNeighbor GRPO\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u3001\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eSDE-based\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Neighbor GRPO\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86SDE-based GRPO\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u786e\u5b9a\u6027ODE\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite impressive progress with vision-language models like CLIP, existing methods still fall into the dilemma between structural risk of known-classes and open-space risk from unknown-classes, and easily suffers from over-confidence, especially when distinguishing ``hard unknowns\" that share fine-grained visual similarities with known classes. To this end, we propose a Semantic-enhanced CLIP (SeeCLIP) framework that explicitly addresses this dilemma through fine-grained semantic enhancement. In SeeCLIP, we propose a semantic-aware prompt enhancement module to decompose images into discriminative semantic tokens, enabling nuanced vision-language alignment beyond coarse category labels. To position unknown prompts effectively, we introduce duplex contrastive learning with complementary objectives, that is, repulsion to maintain separability from known classes, and cohesion to preserve semantic proximity. Further, our semantic-guided diffusion module synthesizes pseudo-unknowns by perturbing extracted semantic tokens, generating challenging samples that are visually similar to known classes yet exhibit key local differences. These hard negatives force the model to learn finer decision boundaries.

Understanding what makes humans perceive an image as complex is also a long-standing question in cognitive science. Recent approaches have leveraged multimodal models that combine visual and linguistic representations, but it remains unclear whether language information is necessary for this task. We propose DReX (DINO-ResNet Fusion), a vision-only model that fuses self-supervised and convolutional representations through a learnable attention mechanism to predict image complexity. Our architecture integrates multi-scale hierarchical features from ResNet-50 with semantically rich representations from DINOv3 ViT-S/16, enabling the model to capture both low-level texture patterns and high-level semantic structure. DReX achieves state-of-the-art performance on the IC9600 benchmark (Pearson r = 0.9581), surpassing previous methods--including those trained on multimodal image-text data--while using approximately 21.5x fewer learnable parameters. Furthermore, DReX generalizes robustly across multiple datasets and metrics, achieving superior results on Pearson and Spearman correlation, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Ablation and attention analyses confirm that DReX leverages complementary cues from both backbones, with the DINOv3 [CLS] token enhancing sensitivity to visual complexity.

In this paper, we propose a unified Memory-Enhanced Visual-Language Recovery (MVLR) model that restores images from different degradation levels under various weather conditions. MVLR couples a lightweight encoder-decoder backbone with a Visual-Language Model (VLM) and an Implicit Memory Bank (IMB). The VLM performs chain-of-thought inference to encode weather degradation priors and the IMB stores continuous latent representations of degradation patterns. The VLM-generated priors query the IMB to retrieve fine-grained degradation prototypes. These prototypes are then adaptively fused with multi-scale visual features via dynamic cross-attention mechanisms, enhancing restoration accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on four severe-weather benchmarks show that MVLR surpasses single-branch and Mixture-of-Experts baselines in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM).

Existing evaluations often rely on benchmarks featuring only a singular cultural concept per image, overlooking scenarios where multiple, potentially unrelated cultural cues coexist. To address this gap, we introduce ConfusedTourist, a novel cultural adversarial robustness suite designed to assess VLMs' stability against perturbed geographical cues. Our experiments reveal a critical vulnerability, where accuracy drops heavily under simple image-stacking perturbations and even worsens with its image-generation-based variant. Interpretability analyses further show that these failures stem from systematic attention shifts toward distracting cues, diverting the model from its intended focus.

Since lens blur typically varies with scene depth, the placement of virtual objects and their corresponding blur levels significantly affect the visual fidelity of mixed reality compositions. Existing pipelines often rely on camera parameters (e.g., focal length, focus distance, aperture size) and scene depth to compute the circle of confusion (CoC) for realistic lens blur rendering. However, such information is often unavailable to ordinary users, limiting the accessibility and generalizability of these methods. In this work, we propose a novel compositing approach that directly estimates the CoC map from RGB images, bypassing the need for scene depth or camera metadata. The CoC values for virtual objects are inferred through a linear relationship between its signed CoC map and depth, and realistic lens blur is rendered using a neural reblurring network.

Without any manual layout design or panoramic image guidance, our framework can generate explicit layout criteria for rational spatial placement. We begin by introducing a hierarchical structure of language-driven agent planners that can automatically parse short and ambiguous prompts into detailed scene descriptions. These descriptions include raw spatial and semantic attributes for each object and the background, which are then used to initialize 3D point clouds. To position objects within bounded environments, we implement two arrangement constraints that iteratively optimize spatial arrangements, ensuring a collision-free and accessible layout solution. In the final rendering stage, we propose a novel AnyReach Sampling strategy for camera trajectory, along with the Interval Timestep Flow Sampling (ITFS) strategy, to efficiently optimize the coarse 3D Gaussian scene representation.

However, in many instance-level tasks, such as visual grounding and object detection, LVLMs still show performance gaps compared to previous expert models. Meanwhile, although pedestrian tracking is a classical task, there have been a number of new topics in combining object tracking and natural language, such as Referring MOT, Cross-view Referring MOT, and Semantic MOT. These tasks emphasize that models should understand the tracked object at an advanced semantic level, which is exactly where LVLMs excel. In this paper, we propose a new unified Pedestrian Tracking framework, namely OmniPT, which can track, track based on reference and generate semantic understanding of tracked objects interactively. We address two issues: how to model the tracking task into a task that foundation models can perform, and how to make the model output formatted answers. To this end, we implement a training phase consisting of RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL. Based on the pre-trained weights of the LVLM, we first perform a simple RL phase to enable the model to output fixed and supervisable bounding box format. Subsequently, we conduct a mid-training phase using a large number of pedestrian-related datasets. Finally, we perform supervised fine-tuning on several pedestrian tracking datasets, and then carry out another RL phase to improve the model's tracking performance and enhance its ability to follow instructions. We conduct experiments on tracking benchmarks and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can perform better than the previous methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u884c\u4eba\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6846\u67b6OmniPT\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u5e76\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6267\u884c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u683c\u5f0f\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "LVLMs\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u5982\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u884c\u4eba\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u8fd9\u6b63\u662fLVLMs\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u6240\u5728\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u73b0RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684LVLM\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5148\u8fdb\u884cRL\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u56fa\u5b9a\u53ef\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u91cf\u884c\u4eba\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2d\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5728\u51e0\u4e2a\u884c\u4eba\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u518d\u8fdb\u884cRL\u9636\u6bb5\u63d0\u5347\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8ddf\u8e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniPT\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u884c\u4eba\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We propose RL-AD-Net, a reinforcement learning (RL) refinement framework that operates in the latent space of a pretrained point autoencoder. The autoencoder encodes completions into compact global feature vectors (GFVs), which are selectively adjusted by an RL agent to improve geometric fidelity. To ensure robustness, a lightweight non-parametric PointNN selector evaluates the geometric consistency of both the original completion and the RL-refined output, retaining the better reconstruction. When ground truth is available, both Chamfer Distance and geometric consistency metrics guide refinement. Training is performed separately per category, since the unsupervised and dynamic nature of RL makes convergence across highly diverse categories challenging. Nevertheless, the framework can be extended to multi-category refinement in future work. Experiments on ShapeNetCore-2048 demonstrate that while baseline completion networks perform reasonable under their training-style cropping, they struggle in random cropping scenarios. In contrast, RL-AD-Net consistently delivers improvements across both settings, highlighting the effectiveness of RL-guided ensemble refinement.

We first model a decoupled screw motion for each joint without type prior, and jointly optimize part-aware Gaussians with joint parameters through part motion blending. To introduce time-continuous geometric constraint for articulated modeling, we encourage Gaussians to be planar and propose a temporally consistent regularization between planar normal and depth through Taylor first-order expansion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world articulated objects demonstrate our superiority in generalizable part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation, compared to existing approaches.

To address this, we propose ReBrain, a retrieval-augmented diffusion framework for brain MRI reconstruction. Given any 3D CT scan with limited slices, we first employ a Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM) to synthesize MRI slices along the 2D dimension. Simultaneously, we retrieve structurally and pathologically similar CT slices from a comprehensive prior database via a fine-tuned retrieval model. These retrieved slices are used as references, incorporated through a ControlNet branch to guide the generation of intermediate MRI slices and ensure structural continuity. We further account for rare retrieval failures when the database lacks suitable references and apply spherical linear interpolation to provide supplementary guidance.

However, existing articulated object reconstruction methods typically require costly inputs such as multi-stage and multi-view observations. To address the limitations, we propose a category-agnostic articulated object reconstruction framework via planar Gaussian Splatting, which only uses sparse-view RGB images from a single state. Specifically, we first introduce a Gaussian information field to perceive the optimal sparse viewpoints from candidate camera poses. Then we compress 3D Gaussians into planar Gaussians to facilitate accurate estimation of normal and depth. The planar Gaussians are optimized in a coarse-to-fine manner through depth smooth regularization and few-shot diffusion.

Recent advances in large pre-trained models have opened new opportunities for training-free VAD by leveraging rich prior knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. However, existing studies typically rely on dense frame-level inference, incurring high computational costs and latency. This raises a fundamental question: Is dense reasoning truly necessary when using powerful pre-trained models in VAD systems? To answer this, we propose ReCoVAD, a novel framework inspired by the dual reflex and conscious pathways of the human nervous system, enabling selective frame processing to reduce redundant computation. ReCoVAD consists of two core pathways: (i) a Reflex pathway that uses a lightweight CLIP-based module to fuse visual features with prototype prompts and produce decision vectors, which query a dynamic memory of past frames and anomaly scores for fast response; and (ii) a Conscious pathway that employs a medium-scale vision-language model to generate textual event descriptions and refined anomaly scores for novel frames. It continuously updates the memory and prototype prompts, while an integrated large language model periodically reviews accumulated descriptions to identify unseen anomalies, correct errors, and refine prototypes. Extensive experiments show that ReCoVAD achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance while processing only 28.55\\% and 16.04\\% of the frames used by previous methods on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, demonstrating that sparse reasoning is sufficient for effective large-model-based VAD.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReCoVAD\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u53cc\u901a\u8def\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5e27\u5904\u7406\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4ec5\u5904\u740628.55%\u548c16.04%\u7684\u5e27\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bc6\u96c6\u5e27\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5927\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5927\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u5bc6\u96c6\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReCoVAD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u901a\u8def\uff1a\u53cd\u5c04\u901a\u8def\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CLIP\u6a21\u5757\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u539f\u578b\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u67e5\u8be2\u52a8\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8fdb\u884c\u5feb\u901f\u54cd\u5e94\uff1b\u610f\u8bc6\u901a\u8def\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u7cbe\u70bc\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u671f\u5ba1\u67e5\u63cf\u8ff0\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u672a\u89c1\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "result": "\u5728UCF-Crime\u548cXD-Violence\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cReCoVAD\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ec5\u5904\u7406\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u6240\u7528\u5e27\u6570\u768428.55%\u548c16.04%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u63a8\u7406\u5df2\u8db3\u591f\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5bc6\u96c6\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

Although recent studies have achieved notable improvements by leveraging the knowledge embedded within pre-trained visual models, the lack of direct association between factual-level features and emotional categories, called the \"affective gap\", limits the applicability of pre-training knowledge for VER tasks. On the contrary, the explicit emotional expression and high information density in textual modality eliminate the \"affective gap\". Therefore, we propose borrowing the knowledge from the pre-trained textual model to enhance the emotional perception of pre-trained visual models. We focus on the factual and emotional connections between images and texts in noisy social media data, and propose Partitioned Adaptive Contrastive Learning (PACL) to leverage these connections. Specifically, we manage to separate different types of samples and devise distinct contrastive learning strategies for each type. By dynamically constructing negative and positive pairs, we fully exploit the potential of noisy samples.

While training-free CoT compression methods have emerged in the LLMs domain, they rely on static visual references and thus provide limited gains for multimodal reasoning. Therefore, we propose ChainV, a framework that dynamically integrates visual hints into the reasoning process, thereby making multimodal reasoning shorter and better. Specifically, ChainV first performs a coarse visual patch selection based on the previous reasoning step, then refines it by identifying the most representative atomic visual hint according to the averaged attention intensity. Additionally, ChainV introduces a consistency-based evaluation mechanism to assess the reliability of the chosen hint, guiding the model to adaptively adjust its level of self-reflection. Eventually, the pixel coordinates of the selected visual hint and its reliability are incorporated into thinking with a Bernoulli stochastic process. Experiments indicate that our method significantly improves reasoning accuracy and efficiency, especially on math-intensive benchmarks where visual hints are crucial for multi-step symbolic reasoning.

However, modern lighting technologies such as LEDs can deviate substantially from the Planckian locus, exposing the limitations of relying on conventional one-dimensional CCT for illumination characterization. This paper demonstrates that transitioning from 1D CCT (on the Planckian locus) to a 2D chromaticity space (off the Planckian locus) improves colorimetric accuracy across various mapping approaches. In addition, we replace conventional CCT interpolation with a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that leverages 2D chromaticity features for robust colorimetric mapping under non-Planckian illuminants. A lightbox-based calibration procedure incorporating representative LED sources is used to train our MLP. Validated across diverse LED lighting, our method reduces angular reproduction error by 22% on average in LED-lit scenes, maintains backward compatibility with traditional illuminants, accommodates multi-illuminant scenes, and supports real-time in-camera deployment with negligible additional computational cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece1D CCT\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u54112D\u8272\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u989c\u8272\u6620\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7MLP\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edfCCT\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u975e\u666e\u6717\u514b\u5149\u6e90\uff08\u5982LED\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u8272\u5f69\u8fd8\u539f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3LED\u7167\u660e\u6280\u672f\u5e38\u5e38\u504f\u79bb\u666e\u6717\u514b\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8eCCT\u7684\u4e00\u7ef4\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u666e\u6717\u514b\u5149\u6e90\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8272\u5f69\u6620\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75282D\u8272\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\uff08MLP\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5305\u542b\u4ee3\u8868\u6027LED\u5149\u6e90\u7684\u5149\u7bb1\u6821\u51c6\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684CCT\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cdLED\u7167\u660e\u4e0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1122%\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u518d\u73b0\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5149\u6e90\u7684\u5411\u540e\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u5149\u6e90\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e14\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ece1D CCT\u52302D\u8272\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u7ed3\u5408MLP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u975e\u666e\u6717\u514b\u5149\u6e90\u4e0b\u7684\u8272\u5f69\u8fd8\u539f\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002"}}

This work presents a complete, multi-stage optimization framework to bridge the gap between high-performance floating-point models and efficient, hardware-friendly integer-based implementations. First, we address the fundamental problem of quantization-induced performance degradation. We propose a Dynamic Range-Aware Quantization (DRAQ) method that uses statistically-calibrated activation clipping and a novel weight regularization scheme to counteract the effects of extreme data outliers and large dynamic ranges, successfully creating a high-fidelity 8-bit integer model. Second, building on this robust foundation, we introduce two hardware-aware optimization techniques tailored for FPGAs. A progressive mixed-precision search algorithm exploits FPGA flexibility to assign optimal, non-uniform bit-widths to each layer, minimizing complexity while preserving performance. Concurrently, a channel pruning method, adapted to work with the Generalized Divisive Normalization (GDN) layers common in LIC, removes model redundancy by eliminating inactive channels. Our comprehensive experiments show that the foundational DRAQ method reduces the BD-rate overhead of a GDN-based model from $30\\%$ to $6.3\\%$. The subsequent hardware-aware optimizations further reduce computational complexity by over $20\\%$ with negligible impact on RD performance, yielding a final model that is both state-of-the-art in efficiency and superior in quality to existing FPGA-based LIC implementations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6d6e\u70b9\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u76848\u4f4d\u6574\u6570FPGA\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u611f\u77e5\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u901a\u9053\u526a\u679d\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684FPGA\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u91cf\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u611f\u77e5\u91cf\u5316(DRAQ)\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u88c1\u526a\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u548c\u5927\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\uff1b2. \u6e10\u8fdb\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\uff1a\u4e3aFPGA\u5206\u914d\u6700\u4f18\u975e\u5747\u5300\u4f4d\u5bbd\uff1b3. \u901a\u9053\u526a\u679d\uff1a\u9488\u5bf9GDN\u5c42\u6d88\u9664\u975e\u6d3b\u8dc3\u901a\u9053\u3002", "result": "DRAQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06GDN\u6a21\u578b\u7684BD-rate\u5f00\u9500\u4ece30%\u964d\u81f36.3%\uff0c\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u964d\u4f4e20%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bf9RD\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709FPGA\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6d6e\u70b9\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u9ad8\u6548\u6574\u6570FPGA\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present ODTSR, a one-step diffusion transformer based on Qwen-Image that performs Real-ISR considering fidelity and controllability simultaneously: a newly introduced visual stream receives low-quality images (LQ) with adjustable noise (Control Noise), and the original visual stream receives LQs with consistent noise (Prior Noise), forming the Noise-hybrid Visual Stream (NVS) design. ODTSR further employs Fidelity-aware Adversarial Training (FAA) to enhance controllability and achieve one-step inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ODTSR not only achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on generic Real-ISR, but also enables prompt controllability on challenging scenarios such as real-world scene text image super-resolution (STISR) of Chinese characters without training on specific datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "ODTSR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eQwen-Image\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u566a\u58f0\u6df7\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u6d41\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u591a\u6b65\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4f4e\uff0c\u800c\u4e00\u6b65\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7279\u5b9a\u5fae\u8c03\u5931\u53bb\u63a7\u5236\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u566a\u58f0\u6df7\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u6d41\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u65b0\u89c6\u89c9\u6d41\u63a5\u6536\u5e26\u53ef\u8c03\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u539f\u89c6\u89c9\u6d41\u63a5\u6536\u5e26\u4e00\u81f4\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u901a\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e2d\u6587\u573a\u666f\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d0\u793a\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "ODTSR\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e2d\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose DiffRefiner, a novel two-stage trajectory prediction framework. The first stage uses a transformer-based Proposal Decoder to generate coarse trajectory predictions by regressing from sensor inputs using predefined trajectory anchors. The second stage applies a Diffusion Refiner that iteratively denoises and refines these initial predictions. In this way, we enhance the performance of diffusion-based planning by incorporating a discriminative trajectory proposal module, which provides strong guidance for the generative refinement process. Furthermore, we design a fine-grained denoising decoder to enhance scene compliance, enabling more accurate trajectory prediction through enhanced alignment with the surrounding environment. Experimental results demonstrate that DiffRefiner achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 87.4 EPDMS on NAVSIM v2, and 87.1 DS along with 71.4 SR on Bench2Drive, thereby setting new records on both public benchmarks.

To mitigate this issue, it is practical to develop unpaired image translation (UIT) methods that effectively align the statistical distributions between source and target domains, particularly under the constraint of a reused inference-blackbox setting. However, existing UIT approaches often overlook class-specific semantic alignment during domain adaptation, resulting in misaligned content-class mappings that can impair diagnostic accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose UI-Styler, a novel ultrasound-specific, class-aware image style transfer framework. UI-Styler leverages a pattern-matching mechanism to transfer texture patterns embedded in the target images onto source images while preserving the source structural content. In addition, we introduce a class-aware prompting strategy guided by pseudo labels of the target domain, which enforces accurate semantic alignment with diagnostic categories.

Building on this dataset, we propose $\\textbf{FireScope}$, a VLM-based reasoning-to-generation framework that learns from both reinforcement learning and visual supervision to predict risk rasters with complementary reasoning traces.

Our findings demonstrate that reasoning can ground raster prediction models, improving both generalization and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to (1) demonstrate that language-based reasoning can improve generalization in visual generation, (2) propose a high-resolution wildfire risk model that can be applied across continents, and (3) enable systematic studies of robust cross-continental generalization for multimodal fire risk models.

Unlike prior work that uses these features in isolation or buried within complex architectures, we systematically evaluate them across modalities (audio, video, multimodal) and domains (lip movements, generic visual content). We assess three key dimensions: detection effectiveness, interpretability of encoded information, and cross-modal complementarity. We find that most self-supervised features capture deepfake-relevant information, and that this information is complementary. Moreover, models primarily attend to semantically meaningful regions rather than spurious artifacts. Yet none generalize reliably across datasets. This generalization failure likely stems from dataset characteristics, not from the features themselves latching onto superficial patterns.

Yet, recognizing traffic signs at night remains challenging due to visual noise and scarcity of public nighttime datasets. Despite advances in vision architectures, existing methods struggle with robustness under low illumination and fail to leverage complementary mutlimodal cues effectively. To overcome these limitations, firstly, we introduce INTSD, a large-scale dataset comprising street-level night-time images of traffic signboards collected across diverse regions of India. The dataset spans 41 traffic signboard classes captured under varying lighting and weather conditions, providing a comprehensive benchmark for both detection and classification tasks. To benchmark INTSD for night-time sign recognition, we conduct extensive evaluations using state-of-the-art detection and classification models.

We find that existing video recapture methods suffer from suboptimal camera motion injection strategies; such suboptimal designs not only limit camera control precision but also result in generated videos that fail to preserve fine visual details from the source video. To achieve more accurate and flexible motion manipulation, PostCam introduces a query-shared cross-attention module. It integrates two distinct forms of control signals: the 6-DoF camera poses and the 2D rendered video frames. By fusing them into a unified representation within a shared feature space, our model can extract underlying motion cues, which enhances both control precision and generation quality. Furthermore, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: the model first learns coarse camera control from pose inputs, and then incorporates visual information to refine motion accuracy and enhance visual fidelity. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that PostCam outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 20% in camera control precision and view consistency, while achieving the highest video generation quality.

Noise modeling methods can fit noise distributions to generate synthetic HSIs to train denoising networks. However, the noise in captured HSIs is usually complex and difficult to model accurately, which significantly limits the effectiveness of these approaches. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage noise-decoupling framework that decomposes complex noise into explicitly modeled and implicitly modeled components. This decoupling reduces the complexity of noise and enhances the learnability of HSI denoising methods when applied to real paired data. Specifically, for explicitly modeled noise, we utilize an existing noise model to generate paired data for pre-training a denoising network, equipping it with prior knowledge to handle the explicitly modeled noise effectively. For implicitly modeled noise, we introduce a high-frequency wavelet guided network. Leveraging the prior knowledge from the pre-trained module, this network adaptively extracts high-frequency features to target and remove the implicitly modeled noise from real paired HSIs. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate all noise components and mitigate error accumulation across stages, a multi-stage learning strategy, comprising separate pre-training and joint fine-tuning, is employed to optimize the entire framework.

Within this unified framework, the designed visual and action representations jointly make robotic manipulation spatially-smooth and temporally-coherent.

While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offers strong zero-shot priors and has been widely fine-tuned across downstream tasks, its large parameter count and computational overhead challenge practical deployment. This paper demonstrates that the SAM paradigm is highly promising once its computational efficiency and performance can be balanced. To this end, we introduce the Alignment Layer, a lightweight, plug-and-play module which aligns encoder-decoder feature distributions to efficiently adapt SAM to specific medical images, improving accuracy while reducing computation. Building on SAM and the Alignment Layer, we then propose Continual Alignment for SAM (CA-SAM), a continual learning strategy that automatically adapts the appropriate Alignment Layer to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, while leveraging SAM's zero-shot priors to preserve strong performance on unseen medical datasets. Experimented across nine medical segmentation datasets under continual-learning scenario, CA-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

To address these issues, we propose SING3R-SLAM, a globally consistent and compact Gaussian-based dense RGB SLAM framework. The key idea is to combine locally consistent 3D reconstructions with a unified global Gaussian representation that jointly refines scene geometry and camera poses, enabling efficient and versatile 3D mapping for multiple downstream applications. SING3R-SLAM first builds locally consistent submaps through our lightweight tracking and reconstruction module, and then progressively aligns and fuses them into a global Gaussian map that enforces cross-view geometric consistency. This global map, in turn, provides feedback to correct local drift and enhance the robustness of tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SING3R-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art tracking, 3D reconstruction, and novel view rendering, resulting in over 12% improvement in tracking and producing finer, more detailed geometry, all while maintaining a compact and memory-efficient global representation on real-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "SING3R-SLAM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u7a20\u5bc6RGB SLAM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u4e00\u81f43D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u7edf\u4e00\u5168\u5c40\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u573a\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u7528\u90143D\u5efa\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u7a20\u5bc63D\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728SLAM\u4e2d\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u70b9\u4e91\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u6a21\u5757\u6784\u5efa\u5c40\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u5b50\u56fe\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u9010\u6b65\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u9ad8\u65af\u5730\u56fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5168\u5c40\u5730\u56fe\u53cd\u9988\u7ea0\u6b63\u5c40\u90e8\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u30013D\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u6e32\u67d3\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc712%\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u5168\u5c40\u8868\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "SING3R-SLAM\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7a20\u5bc6SLAM\u4e2d\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u76843D\u5efa\u56fe\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

This is critical for applications like surveillance, medical imaging, and consumer electronics. However, current methods struggle with limited real-world LR-HR data, impacting the learning of basic image features. Pre-trained SR models from large-scale synthetic datasets offer valuable prior knowledge, which can improve generalization, speed up training, and reduce the need for extensive real-world data in realistic SR tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Dual-domain Adaptation Networks, which is able to efficiently adapt pre-trained image SR models from simulated to real-world datasets. To achieve this target, we first set up a spatial-domain adaptation strategy through selectively updating parameters of pre-trained models and employing the low-rank adaptation technique to adjust frozen parameters. Recognizing that image super-resolution involves recovering high-frequency components, we further integrate a frequency domain adaptation branch into the adapted model, which combines the spectral data of the input and the spatial-domain backbone's intermediate features to infer HR frequency maps, enhancing the SR result. Experimental evaluations on public realistic image SR benchmarks, including RealSR, D2CRealSR, and DRealSR, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over existing state-of-the-art models.

Since large-scale 3D annotation is prohibitively expensive, recent work explores self-supervised learning directly from sensor data without manual labels. Existing approaches either rely on 2D rendering consistency, where 3D structure emerges only implicitly, or on discretized voxel grids from accumulated lidar point clouds, limiting spatial precision and scalability. We introduce QueryOcc, a query-based self-supervised framework that learns continuous 3D semantic occupancy directly through independent 4D spatio-temporal queries sampled across adjacent frames. The framework supports supervision from either pseudo-point clouds derived from vision foundation models or raw lidar data. To enable long-range supervision and reasoning under constant memory, we introduce a contractive scene representation that preserves near-field detail while smoothly compressing distant regions. QueryOcc surpasses previous camera-based methods by 26% in semantic RayIoU on the self-supervised Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark while running at 11.6 FPS, demonstrating that direct 4D query supervision enables strong self-supervised occupancy learning. https://research.zenseact.com/publications/queryocc/", "AI": {"tldr": "QueryOcc\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc74D\u65f6\u7a7a\u67e5\u8be2\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u8fde\u7eed3D\u8bed\u4e49\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u76d1\u7763Occ3D-nuScenes\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534726%\u7684\u8bed\u4e49RayIoU\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u8fbe11.6 FPS\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a213D\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d562D\u6e32\u67d3\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5bfc\u81f43D\u7ed3\u6784\u4ec5\u9690\u5f0f\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u4f53\u7d20\u7f51\u683c\u9650\u5236\u7a7a\u95f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u72ec\u7acb\u76844D\u65f6\u7a7a\u67e5\u8be2\u5728\u76f8\u90bb\u5e27\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4f2a\u70b9\u4e91\u6216\u539f\u59cb\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6536\u7f29\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u5728\u6052\u5b9a\u5185\u5b58\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u76d1\u7763Occ3D-nuScenes\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49RayIoU\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u76f8\u673a\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534726%\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u8fbe11.6 FPS\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f4\u63a5\u76844D\u67e5\u8be2\u76d1\u7763\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5360\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

In this study, we propose a comprehensive intervention framework aligned with the transformer's causal architecture in LVLMs, integrating the effects of different intervention paths on hallucination. We find that hallucinations in LVLMs do not arise from a single causal path, but rather from the interplay among image-to-input-text, image-to-output-text, and text-to-text pathways.

However, improving their performance often requires fine-tuning and scaling to larger model variants. In this work, we propose a mechanism inspired by traditional text-based search to improve retrieval performance at inference time: relevance feedback. While relevance feedback can serve as an alternative to fine-tuning, its model-agnostic design also enables use with fine-tuned VLMs. Specifically, we introduce and evaluate four feedback strategies for VLM-based retrieval. First, we revise classical pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), which refines query embeddings based on top-ranked results. To address its limitations, we propose generative relevance feedback (GRF), which uses synthetic captions for query refinement. Furthermore, we introduce an attentive feedback summarizer (AFS), a custom transformer-based model that integrates multimodal fine-grained features from relevant items. Finally, we simulate explicit feedback using ground-truth captions as an upper-bound baseline. Experiments on Flickr30k and COCO with the VLM backbones show that GRF, AFS, and explicit feedback improve retrieval performance by 3-5% in MRR@5 for smaller VLMs, and 1-3% for larger ones, compared to retrieval with no feedback. Moreover, AFS, similarly to explicit feedback, mitigates query drift and is more robust than GRF in iterative, multi-turn retrieval settings. Our findings demonstrate that relevance feedback can consistently enhance retrieval across VLMs and open up opportunities for interactive and adaptive visual search.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u56db\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u3001\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53cd\u9988\u603b\u7ed3\u5668\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd3-5%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89c6\u89c9\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u4f46\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u53d7\u4f20\u7edf\u6587\u672c\u641c\u7d22\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u6539\u5584\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1) \u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53cd\u9988(PRF)\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u540d\u9760\u524d\u7ed3\u679c\u4f18\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b2) \u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53cd\u9988(GRF)\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6807\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\uff1b3) \u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53cd\u9988\u603b\u7ed3\u5668(AFS)\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u6574\u5408\u76f8\u5173\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\uff1b4) \u663e\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u9898\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u9650\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728Flickr30k\u548cCOCO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cGRF\u3001AFS\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u53cd\u9988\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f\u578bVLM\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347MRR@5\u6307\u68073-5%\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u578bVLM\u4e0a\u63d0\u53471-3%\u3002AFS\u4e0e\u663e\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u7c7b\u4f3c\uff0c\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u67e5\u8be2\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u8fed\u4ee3\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u6bd4GRF\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c6\u89c9\u641c\u7d22\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\u3002"}}

Acquiring such diverse scenarios from real-world point cloud data, especially for critical edge cases, is challenging, which restricts system generalization and robustness. Current methods rely on simulating point cloud data within handcrafted 3D virtual environments, which is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and often fails to fully capture the complexity of real-world scenes. To address some of these issues, this research proposes a novel approach that addresses the problem discussed by editing real-world LiDAR scans using semantic mask-based guidance to generate novel synthetic LiDAR point clouds. We incorporate range image projection and semantic mask conditioning to achieve diffusion-based generation. Point clouds are transformed to 2D range view images, which are used as an intermediate representation to enable semantic editing using convex hull-based semantic masks. These masks guide the generation process by providing information on the dimensions, orientations, and locations of objects in the real environment, ensuring geometric consistency and realism. This approach demonstrates high-quality LiDAR point cloud generation, capable of producing complex edge cases and dynamic scenes, as validated on the KITTI-360 dataset.

Yet outputs vary across cultural contexts: because language carries cultural connotations, images synthesized from multilingual prompts should preserve cross-lingual cultural consistency. We conduct a comprehensive analysis showing that current T2I models often produce culturally neutral or English-biased results under multilingual prompts. Analyses of two representative models indicate that the issue stems not from missing cultural knowledge but from insufficient activation of culture-related representations. We propose a probing method that localizes culture-sensitive signals to a small set of neurons in a few fixed layers. Guided by this finding, we introduce two complementary alignment strategies: (1) inference-time cultural activation that amplifies the identified neurons without backbone fine-tuned; and (2) layer-targeted cultural enhancement that updates only culturally relevant layers.

This capability is essential for large-scale chemical data mining, drug discovery pipelines, and Large Language Model (LLM) applications in related domains. However, existing OCSR systems face significant challenges in accurately recognizing stereochemical information due to the subtle visual cues that distinguish stereoisomers, such as wedge and dash bonds, ring conformations, and spatial arrangements. To address these challenges, we propose MolSight, a comprehensive learning framework for OCSR that employs a three-stage training paradigm. In the first stage, we conduct pre-training on large-scale but noisy datasets to endow the model with fundamental perception capabilities for chemical structure images. In the second stage, we perform multi-granularity fine-tuning using datasets with richer supervisory signals, systematically exploring how auxiliary tasks-specifically chemical bond classification and atom localization-contribute to molecular formula recognition. Finally, we employ reinforcement learning for post-training optimization and introduce a novel stereochemical structure dataset. Remarkably, we find that even with MolSight's relatively compact parameter size, the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm can further enhance the model's performance on stereomolecular.

Existing finger pose estimation algorithms that can be implemented in portable devices predominantly rely on capacitive images, which are currently limited to estimating pitch and yaw angles and exhibit reduced accuracy when processing large-angle inputs (especially when it is greater than 45 degrees). In this paper, we propose BiFingerPose, a novel bimodal based finger pose estimation algorithm capable of simultaneously and accurately predicting comprehensive finger pose information. A bimodal input is explored, including a capacitive image and a fingerprint patch obtained from the touchscreen with an under-screen fingerprint sensor. Our approach leads to reliable estimation of roll angle, which is not achievable using only a single modality. In addition, the prediction performance of other pose parameters has also been greatly improved. The evaluation of a 12-person user study on continuous and discrete interaction tasks further validated the advantages of our approach. Specifically, BiFingerPose outperforms previous SOTA methods with over 21% improvement in prediction performance, 2.5 times higher task completion efficiency, and 23% better user operation accuracy, demonstrating its practical superiority.

This motivates us to complement CLIP with the geometry features from vision-only self-supervised learning via a hierarchical adapter, enhancing the spatial awareness in the proposed SpatialGeo. The network is efficiently trained using pretrained LLaVA model and optimized with random feature dropping to avoid trivial solutions relying solely on the CLIP encoder.

When scaled to large datasets, this paradigm has achieved state-of-the-art performance and the resulting trained models such as DINOv3 have seen widespread adoption.

One important exception is Cross-View Completion, CroCo, which is a form of masked autoencoding (MAE) tailored for 3D understanding. In this work, we continue on the path proposed by CroCo and focus on learning features tailored for 3D vision. In a nutshell, we extend MAE to arbitrarily many views of the same scene. By uniformly masking all views and employing a lightweight decoder with inter-frame attention, our approach is inherently simpler and more scalable than CroCo. We evaluate the resulting model, MuM, extensively on downstream tasks including feedforward reconstruction, dense image matching and relative pose estimation, finding that it outperforms the state-of-the-art visual encoders DINOv3 and CroCo v2.", "AI": {"tldr": "MuM\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06MAE\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u57283D\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86DINOv3\u548cCroCo v2\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u800c\u975e\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\uff0cCroCo\u662f\u9762\u54113D\u7406\u89e3\u7684MAE\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u5c06MAE\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u89c6\u56fe\u7edf\u4e00\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u5e27\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u5bc6\u96c6\u56fe\u50cf\u5339\u914d\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86DINOv3\u548cCroCo v2\u3002", "conclusion": "MuM\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4CroCo\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u57283D\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

Existing methods, particularly NoPe-NeRF, which focus solely on the local relationships within images, often struggle to recover accurate camera poses in complex scenarios. To overcome the challenges, our approach begins with a relative pose initialization with explicit feature matching, followed by a local joint optimization to enhance the pose estimation for training a more robust NeRF representation. This method significantly improves the quality of initial poses. Additionally, we introduce global optimization phase that incorporates geometric consistency constraints through bundle adjustment, which integrates feature trajectories to further refine poses and collectively boost the quality of NeRF. Notably, our method is the first work that seamlessly combines the local and global cues with NeRF, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pose estimation accuracy and novel view synthesis.

However, one domain in which they perform notably poorly is in the synthesis of transparent objects, which exhibit refraction, reflection, absorption and scattering. Refraction is a particular challenge, because refracted pixel rays often intersect with surfaces observed in other parts of the image, providing a constraint on the color. It is clear from inspection that generative models have not distilled the laws of optics sufficiently well to accurately render refractive objects. In this work, we consider the problem of generating images with accurate refraction, given a text prompt. We synchronize the pixels within the object's boundary with those outside by warping and merging the pixels using Snell's Law of Refraction, at each step of the generation trajectory. For those surfaces that are not directly observed in the image, but are visible via refraction or reflection, we recover their appearance by synchronizing the image with a second generated image -- a panorama centered at the object -- using the same warping and merging procedure.

To address this, we propose a unified framework for multi-media painting process generation with a semantics-driven style control mechanism that embeds multiple media into a diffusion models conditional space and uses cross-medium style augmentation. This enables consistent texture evolution and process transfer across styles. A reverse-painting training strategy further ensures smooth, human-aligned generation.

A key challenge of this task lies in its dependence on large, manually labeled datasets whose acquisition is costly and time-consuming. This paper devises a novel, label-efficient method for skeleton-based action recognition using graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The contribution of the proposed method resides in learning a novel acquisition function -- scoring the most informative subsets for labeling -- as the optimum of an objective function mixing data representativity, diversity and uncertainty. We also extend this approach by learning the most informative subsets using an invertible GCN which allows mapping data from ambient to latent spaces where the inherent distribution of the data is more easily captured.

However, it treats all regions uniformly and independently, lacking an explicit notion of where or in what order predictions should be made. Inspired by human visual perception, which deploys attention selectively and sequentially from the most informative to secondary regions, we propose DSeq-JEPA, a Discriminative Sequential Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture that bridges predictive and autoregressive self-supervised learning, integrating JEPA-style latent prediction with GPT-style sequential reasoning. Specifically, DSeq-JEPA (i) first identifies primary discriminative regions based on a transformer-derived saliency map, emphasizing the distribution of visual importance, and then (ii) predicts subsequent regions in this discriminative order, progressively forming a curriculum-like semantic progression from primary to secondary cues -- a form of GPT-style pre-training.

By capturing micro-level morphological and intensity patterns, these features support more precise tumor identification and improve AI interpretability by highlighting diagnostically relevant cells for pathologist review. However, most existing studies focus on slide-level or patch-level tumor classification, leaving cell-level radiomics analysis largely unexplored. Moreover, there is currently no dedicated backbone specifically designed for radiomics data. Inspired by the recent success of the Mamba architecture in vision and language domains, we introduce a Unified Attention-Mamba (UAM) backbone for cell-level classification using radiomics features. Unlike previous hybrid approaches that integrate Attention and Mamba modules in fixed proportions, our unified design flexibly combines their capabilities within a single cohesive architecture, eliminating the need for manual ratio tuning and improving encode capability. We develop two UAM variants to comprehensively evaluate the benefits of this unified structure. Building on this backbone, we further propose a multimodal UAM framework that jointly performs cell-level classification and image segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that UAM achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tasks on public benchmarks, surpassing leading image-based foundation models. It improves cell classification accuracy from 74% to 78% ($n$=349,882 cells), and tumor segmentation precision from 75% to 80% ($n$=406 patches).

As adversarial fine-tuning is prohibitively costly, recent works explore various test-time defense strategies; however, these approaches still exhibit limited robustness. In this work, we revisit this problem and propose a simple yet effective strategy: Augmentation-based Test-time Adversarial Correction (ATAC). Our method operates directly in the embedding space of CLIP, calculating augmentation-induced drift vectors to infer a semantic recovery direction and correcting the embedding based on the angular consistency of these latent drifts. Across a wide range of benchmarks, ATAC consistently achieves remarkably high robustness, surpassing that of previous state-of-the-art methods by nearly 50\\% on average, all while requiring minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, ATAC retains state-of-the-art robustness in unconventional and extreme settings and even achieves nontrivial robustness against adaptive attacks.

However, existing PR formulations assume a fixed and known perturbation distribution, an unrealistic expectation in practice. To address this limitation, we propose non-parametric probabilistic robustness (NPPR), a more practical PR metric that does not rely on any predefined perturbation distribution. Following the non-parametric paradigm in statistical modeling, NPPR learns an optimized perturbation distribution directly from data, enabling conservative PR evaluation under distributional uncertainty. We further develop an NPPR estimator based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) heads and bicubic up-sampling, covering various input-dependent and input-independent perturbation scenarios. Theoretical analyses establish the relationships among AR, PR, and NPPR.

This methodology emphasizes the representation of a diverse range of facial traits, ensuring adherence to characteristics permissible in identity card photographs. Furthermore, we introduce the Diverse and Inclusive Faces for Verification (DIF-V) dataset, comprising 27,780 images of 926 unique identities, designed as a benchmark for future research in face verification. Our analysis reveals that existing verification models exhibit biases toward certain genders and races, and notably, applying identity style modifications negatively impacts model performance.

By leveraging complementary information across shared contextual cues, it enhances the discriminative evaluation of subtle intra-class variations in highly similar action sequences. However, partial modalities are frequently unavailable at the inference stage in reality. The absence of any modality often renders existing multimodal models inoperable. Furthermore, it triggers catastrophic performance degradation due to interruptions in cross-modal interactions. To address this issue, we propose a novel Missing Completion Framework with Mixture of Experts (MCMoE) that unifies unimodal and joint representation learning in single-stage training. Specifically, we propose an adaptive gated modality generator that dynamically fuses available information to reconstruct missing modalities. We then design modality experts to learn unimodal knowledge and dynamically mix the knowledge of all experts to extract cross-modal joint representations. With a mixture of experts, missing modalities are further refined and complemented. Finally, in the training phase, we mine the complete multimodal features and unimodal expert knowledge to guide modality generation and generation-based joint representation extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MCMoE achieves state-of-the-art results in both complete and incomplete multimodal learning on three public AQA benchmarks.

In high-risk applications such as medical image analysis, this phenomenon may prevent models from using clinically meaningful features when making predictions, potentially leading to poor robustness and harm to patients. We demonstrate that different types of shortcuts (those that are diffuse and spread throughout the image, as well as those that are localized to specific areas) manifest distinctly across network layers and can, therefore, be more effectively targeted through mitigation strategies that target the intermediate layers. We propose a novel knowledge distillation framework that leverages a teacher network fine-tuned on a small subset of task-relevant data to mitigate shortcut learning in a student network trained on a large dataset corrupted with a bias feature. Through extensive experiments on CheXpert, ISIC 2017, and SimBA datasets using various architectures (ResNet-18, AlexNet, DenseNet-121, and 3D CNNs), we demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional Empirical Risk Minimization, augmentation-based bias-mitigation, and group-based bias-mitigation approaches. In many cases, we achieve comparable performance with a baseline model trained on bias-free data, even on out-of-distribution test data.

Built on RS-FMD, we present REMSA, the first LLM-based agent for automated RSFM selection from natural language queries. REMSA interprets user requirements, resolves missing constraints, ranks candidate models using in-context learning, and provides transparent justifications. We also propose a benchmark of 75 expert-verified RS query scenarios, producing 900 configurations under an expert-centered evaluation protocol. REMSA outperforms several baselines, including naive agents, dense retrieval, and unstructured RAG-based LLMs. It operates entirely on publicly available metadata and does not access private or sensitive data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86RSFM\u6570\u636e\u5e93(RS-FMD)\u548cREMSA\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u9065\u611f\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002RS-FMD\u5305\u542b150\u591a\u4e2a\u9065\u611f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0cREMSA\u662f\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u9002\u5408\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9065\u611f\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\uff0c\u4f46\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5f88\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6587\u6863\u5206\u6563\u3001\u683c\u5f0f\u5f02\u6784\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u7ea6\u675f\u591a\u6837\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u9002\u5408\u7684\u9065\u611f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86RSFM\u6570\u636e\u5e93(RS-FMD)\uff0c\u5305\u542b150\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86REMSA\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u89e3\u91ca\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u89e3\u51b3\u7ea6\u675f\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u5019\u9009\u6a21\u578b\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5305\u542b75\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u67e5\u8be2\u573a\u666f\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f900\u4e2a\u914d\u7f6e\u3002REMSA\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6734\u7d20\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3001\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316RAG\u7684LLM\u3002", "conclusion": "REMSA\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u9065\u611f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u57fa\u4e8e\u516c\u5f00\u5143\u6570\u636e\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4e0d\u8bbf\u95ee\u79c1\u6709\u6216\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e3a\u9065\u611f\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

While adversarial knowledge distillation has shown promise in transferring robustness from teacher to student models, traditional single-teacher approaches suffer from limited knowledge diversity, slow convergence, and difficulty in balancing robustness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose MMT-ARD: a Multimodal Multi-Teacher Adversarial Robust Distillation framework. Our key innovation is a dual-teacher knowledge fusion architecture that collaboratively optimizes clean feature preservation and robust feature enhancement. To better handle challenging adversarial examples, we introduce a dynamic weight allocation strategy based on teacher confidence, enabling adaptive focus on harder samples. Moreover, to mitigate bias among teachers, we design an adaptive sigmoid-based weighting function that balances the strength of knowledge transfer across modalities. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that MMT-ARD improves robust accuracy by +4.32% and zero-shot accuracy by +3.5% on the ViT-B-32 model, while achieving a 2.3x increase in training efficiency over traditional single-teacher methods. These results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of MMT-ARD in enhancing the adversarial robustness of multimodal large models.

However, these methods mostly employ single-shot plans that are typically limited to simple motions, or iterative refinement which requires multiple calls to the video generator, incuring high computational cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose SketchVerify, a training-free, sketch-verification-based planning framework that improves motion planning quality with more dynamically coherent trajectories (i.e., physically plausible and instruction-consistent motions) prior to full video generation by introducing a test-time sampling and verification loop. Given a prompt and a reference image, our method predicts multiple candidate motion plans and ranks them using a vision-language verifier that jointly evaluates semantic alignment with the instruction and physical plausibility. To efficiently score candidate motion plans, we render each trajectory as a lightweight video sketch by compositing objects over a static background, which bypasses the need for expensive, repeated diffusion-based synthesis while achieving comparable performance. We iteratively refine the motion plan until a satisfactory one is identified, which is then passed to the trajectory-conditioned generator for final synthesis. Experiments on WorldModelBench and PhyWorldBench demonstrate that our method significantly improves motion quality, physical realism, and long-term consistency compared to competitive baselines while being substantially more efficient.

Inspired by an artist's compositional process, illustrator's depth infers a layer index to each pixel, forming an interpretable image decomposition through a discrete, globally consistent ordering of elements optimized for editability. We also propose and train a neural network using a curated dataset of layered vector graphics to predict layering directly from raster inputs.

To reduce the performance gap under domain shifts, a recent trend is to leverage vision foundation models (VFMs) providing robust features across domains.

Building upon unsupervised image-to-lidar knowledge distillation, our study reveals that: (1) the architecture of the lidar backbone is key to maximize the generalization performance on a target domain; (2) it is possible to pretrain a single backbone once and for all, and use it to address many domain shifts; (3) best results are obtained by keeping the pretrained backbone frozen and training an MLP head for semantic segmentation.

Because of the focus on forward simulation, current world models generate predictions based on factual observations. For many emerging applications, such as comprehensive evaluations of physical AI behavior under varying conditions, the ability of world models to answer counterfactual queries, such as \"what would happen if this object was removed?\", is of increasing importance. We formalize counterfactual world models that additionally take interventions as explicit inputs, predicting temporal sequences under hypothetical modifications to observed scene properties. Traditional world models operate directly on entangled pixel-space representations where object properties and relationships cannot be selectively modified. This modeling choice prevents targeted interventions on specific scene properties. We introduce CWMDT, a framework to overcome those limitations, turning standard video diffusion models into effective counterfactual world models. First, CWMDT constructs digital twins of observed scenes to explicitly encode objects and their relationships, represented as structured text. Second, CWMDT applies large language models to reason over these representations and predict how a counterfactual intervention propagates through time to alter the observed scene.

Previous deep learning methods have been applied to radar modeling; however, they often fail to represent arbitrary shapes or have difficulty with real-world radar signals which are collected over limited viewing angles. Existing methods in optical 3D reconstruction can generate arbitrary shapes from limited camera views, but struggle when they naively treat the radar signal as a camera view. In this work, we present Radar2Shape, a denoising diffusion model that handles a partially observable radar signal for 3D reconstruction by correlating its frequencies with multiresolution shape features. Our method consists of a two-stage approach: first, Radar2Shape learns a regularized latent space with hierarchical resolutions of shape features, and second, it diffuses into this latent space by conditioning on the frequencies of the radar signal in an analogous coarse-to-fine manner. We demonstrate that Radar2Shape can successfully reconstruct arbitrary 3D shapes even from partially-observed radar signals, and we show robust generalization to two different simulation methods and real-world data. Additionally, we release two synthetic benchmark datasets to encourage future research in the high-frequency radar domain so that models like Radar2Shape can safely be adapted into real-world radar systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Radar2Shape\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u96f7\u8fbe\u4fe1\u53f7\u9891\u7387\u4e0e\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5f62\u72b6\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u4ece\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c3D\u91cd\u5efa", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u9891\u96f7\u8fbe\u4fe1\u53f7\u76843D\u5f62\u72b6\u91cd\u5efa\u5728\u5546\u4e1a\u548c\u822a\u7a7a\u822a\u5929\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u8868\u793a\u4efb\u610f\u5f62\u72b6\u6216\u5904\u7406\u6709\u9650\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u96f7\u8fbe\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u800c\u5149\u5b663D\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u96f7\u8fbe\u4fe1\u53f7\u7b80\u5355\u89c6\u4e3a\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u56fe\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u5177\u6709\u5c42\u6b21\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5f62\u72b6\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee5\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4ece\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8c03\u8282\u96f7\u8fbe\u4fe1\u53f7\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u5230\u8be5\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d", "result": "Radar2Shape\u80fd\u591f\u6210\u529f\u4ece\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u610f3D\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u4eff\u771f\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9ad8\u9891\u96f7\u8fbe\u9886\u57df\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76"}}

In this paper we propose a novel computer-vison-based deep learning method to estimate spine age using images from over 18,000 MRI series. Data are restricted to subjects with only age-related spine degeneration. Eligibility criteria are created by identifying common age-based clusters of degenerative spine conditions using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (HDBSCAN). Model selection is determined using a detailed ablation study on data size, loss, and the effect of different spine regions. We evaluate the clinical utility of our model by calculating the difference between actual spine age and model-predicted age, the spine age gap (SAG), and examining the association between these differences and spine degenerative conditions and lifestyle factors. We find that SAG is associated with conditions including disc bulges, disc osteophytes, spinal stenosis, and fractures, as well as lifestyle factors like smoking and physically demanding work, and thus may be a useful biomarker for measuring overall spine health.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8d85\u8fc718,000\u4e2aMRI\u7cfb\u5217\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u810a\u67f1\u5e74\u9f84\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u810a\u67f1\u5e74\u9f84\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e0e\u9000\u884c\u6027\u810a\u67f1\u75be\u75c5\u548c\u751f\u6d3b\u65b9\u5f0f\u56e0\u7d20\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u810a\u67f1\u662f\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u53d1\u751f\u4e0e\u5e74\u9f84\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u9000\u884c\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u5316\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7MRI\u8bc6\u522b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u810a\u67f1\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528UMAP\u548cHDBSCAN\u8bc6\u522b\u5e74\u9f84\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u810a\u67f1\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75c5\u53d8\u96c6\u7fa4\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u810a\u67f1\u5e74\u9f84\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u810a\u67f1\u5e74\u9f84\u5dee\u8ddd\uff08SAG\uff09\u4e0e\u690e\u95f4\u76d8\u7a81\u51fa\u3001\u9aa8\u8d58\u3001\u690e\u7ba1\u72ed\u7a84\u3001\u9aa8\u6298\u7b49\u75be\u75c5\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0e\u5438\u70df\u548c\u4f53\u529b\u52b3\u52a8\u7b49\u751f\u6d3b\u65b9\u5f0f\u56e0\u7d20\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u810a\u67f1\u5e74\u9f84\u5dee\u8ddd\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8861\u91cf\u6574\u4f53\u810a\u67f1\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u6709\u7528\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

In this work, we conduct a principled analysis of downscaling intelligence in multimodal models, examining how reduced large language model (LLM) capacity affects multimodal capabilities. Our initial findings reveal an interesting trend: LLM downscaling disproportionately affects visual capabilities, rather than abilities inherited from the LLM. We then examine whether this drop mainly reflects the expected decline in visual reasoning or a more fundamental loss of perceptual abilities. Isolating the effect of LLM downscaling on perception, we find performance still drops sharply, often matching or exceeding the impact on reasoning.

Reconstructing intensity images from events is a highly ill-posed task due to the inherent ambiguity of absolute brightness. Early methods generally follow an end-to-end regression paradigm, directly mapping events to intensity frames in a deterministic manner. While effective to some extent, these approaches often yield perceptually inferior results and struggle to scale up in model capacity and training data. In this work, we propose EvDiff, an event-based diffusion model that follows a surrogate training framework to produce high-quality videos. To reduce the heavy computational cost of high-frame-rate video generation, we design an event-based diffusion model that performs only a single forward diffusion step, equipped with a temporally consistent EvEncoder. Furthermore, our novel Surrogate Training Framework eliminates the dependence on paired event-image datasets, allowing the model to leverage large-scale image datasets for higher capacity. The proposed EvDiff is capable of generating high-quality colorful videos solely from monochromatic event streams.

We formalize the computational correspondence between AR and GAR, survey the technical foundations that make real-time generative augmentation feasible, and outline prospective applications that leverage its unified inference model. We envision GAR as a future AR paradigm that delivers high-fidelity experiences in terms of realism, interactivity, and immersion, while eliciting new research challenges on technologies, content ecosystems, and the ethical and societal implications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u5b9e(GAR)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3AR\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u589e\u5f3a\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u91cd\u5408\u6210\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edfAR\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u7ec4\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002GAR\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edfAR\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u865a\u62df\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u4fe1\u53f7\u8054\u5408\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfAR\u5f15\u64ce\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u4e16\u754c\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002GAR\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u548c\u6c89\u6d78\u611f\u65b9\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a81\u7834\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edfAR\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u865a\u62df\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u4fe1\u53f7\u8054\u5408\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "result": "GAR\u88ab\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3aAR\u4e0eGAR\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u4f7f\u5b9e\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u6982\u8ff0\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u5176\u7edf\u4e00\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "GAR\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684AR\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u6280\u672f\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u65b9\u9762\u5f15\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Existing multimodal KV Cache compression methods mostly rely on attention score to reduce cache size, which makes them are incompatible with established efficient attention kernels (e.g., FlashAttention) and ignores the contribution of value vectors to the attention output. In this work, we revisit multimodal KV Cache compression from the perspective of the KV matrices' distribution. First, we observe that frequency-domain energy of multimodal KV matrices is predominantly concentrated in low-frequency and extract this principal energy via a low-pass filter. Further, we find that removing KV pairs that deviate substantially from this principal energy leads to a pronounced performance drop, which we define as Outlier KVs. Considering Outlier KVs are more likely to encode features critical for inference, we propose FlashCache, a frequency-domain-guided, Outlier-KV-aware KV Cache compression framework. First, we introduce an Outlier KV Recognition Module that models the principal component of multimodal KV matrices in the frequency domain and preferentially retains KV pairs that significantly deviate from it. Furthermore, Dynamic Budget Allocation Module is designed to adaptively determine the per-layer KV Cache size to retain more Outlier KVs. Experiments on multiple MLLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that FlashCache outperforms state-of-the-art multimoal KV compression methods, achieving up to 1.69 times faster decoding with 80% lower KV memory usage while maintaining task performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlashCache\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u57df\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5f02\u5e38KV\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001KV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u504f\u79bb\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u7684\u5f02\u5e38KV\u5bf9\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eKV\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u89e3\u7801", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001KV\u7f13\u5b58\u968f\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u957f\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5185\u6838\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u503c\u5411\u91cf\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u8d21\u732e", "method": "\u4eceKV\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u5e03\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u9891\u57df\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3b\u80fd\u91cf\u6210\u5206\uff1b2\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u5f02\u5e38KV\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u4fdd\u7559\u504f\u79bb\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u7684KV\u5bf9\uff1b3\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u5757\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u786e\u5b9a\u6bcf\u5c42KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5927\u5c0f", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aMLLM\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFlashCache\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001KV\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe1.69\u500d\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u52a0\u901f\u548c80%\u7684KV\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u57df\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5f02\u5e38KV\u611f\u77e5\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def"}}

To address this gap, we present MobileOcc, a semantic occupancy dataset for mobile robots operating in crowded human environments. Our dataset is built using an annotation pipeline that incorporates static object occupancy annotations and a novel mesh optimization framework explicitly designed for human occupancy modeling. It reconstructs deformable human geometry from 2D images and subsequently refines and optimizes it using associated LiDAR point data.

While existing approaches to energy optimization focus on architectural improvements or hardware acceleration, there is a lack of principled methods to predict energy consumption across different model configurations and hardware setups. We propose an adaptation of Kaplan scaling laws to predict GPU energy consumption for diffusion models based on computational complexity (FLOPs). Our approach decomposes diffusion model inference into text encoding, iterative denoising, and decoding components, with the hypothesis that denoising operations dominate energy consumption due to their repeated execution across multiple inference steps. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four state-of-the-art diffusion models (Stable Diffusion 2, Stable Diffusion 3.5, Flux, and Qwen) on three GPU architectures (NVIDIA A100, A4000, A6000), spanning various inference configurations including resolution (256x256 to 1024x1024), precision (fp16/fp32), step counts (10-50), and classifier-free guidance settings. Our energy scaling law achieves high predictive accuracy within individual architectures (R-squared > 0.9) and exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization, maintaining high rank correlations across models and enabling reliable energy estimation for unseen model-hardware combinations. These results validate the compute-bound nature of diffusion inference and provide a foundation for sustainable AI deployment planning and carbon footprint estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578bGPU\u80fd\u8017\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Kaplan\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u80fd\u8017\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u73af\u5883\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6(FLOPs)\u5e94\u7528Kaplan\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u9884\u6d4bGPU\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u53bb\u566a\u64cd\u4f5c\u56e0\u591a\u6b21\u6267\u884c\u800c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e09\u79cdGPU\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u67b6\u6784\u5185\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8(R\u5e73\u65b9>0.9)\uff0c\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\uff0c\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u4f30\u8ba1\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u6a21\u578b-\u786c\u4ef6\u7ec4\u5408\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6301\u7eedAI\u90e8\u7f72\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\u4f30\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We also explore cognitive steering and knowledge injection strategies for persuasion-relevant reasoning. Empirical analysis across VLMs reveals a recall-oriented bias-models over-predict high persuasiveness-and weak discriminative power for low/mid-level features. In contrast, high-level semantic alignment between message and object presence emerges as the strongest predictor of human judgment.

This work proposes the OmniLens++ framework, which resolves two challenges that hinder the generalization ability of existing pipelines: the difficulty of scaling data and the absence of prior guidance characterizing optical degradation. To improve data scalability, we expand the design specifications to increase the degradation diversity of the lens source, and we sample a more uniform distribution by quantifying the spatial-variation patterns and severity of optical degradation. In terms of model design, to leverage the Point Spread Functions (PSFs), which intuitively describe optical degradation, as guidance in a blind paradigm, we propose the Latent PSF Representation (LPR). The VQVAE framework is introduced to learn latent features of LensLib's PSFs, which is assisted by modeling the optical degradation process to constrain the learning of degradation priors. Experiments on diverse aberrations of real-world lenses and synthetic LensLib show that OmniLens++ exhibits state-of-the-art generalization capacity in blind aberration correction. Beyond performance, the AODLibpro is verified as a scalable foundation for more effective training across diverse aberrations, and LPR can further tap the potential of large-scale LensLib.

Materials \\& Methods: Patients with BC treated by NAC with a breast MRI between 2016 and 2020 were included in this retrospective observational single-center study. MR studies were described using the standardized BI-RADS and breast edema score on T2-weighted MRI. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess variables association with pCR according to residual cancer burden. Random forest classifiers were trained to predict pCR on a random split including 70% of the database and were validated on the remaining cases. Results: Among 129 BC, 59 (46%) achieved pCR after NAC (luminal (n=7/37, 19%), triple negative (TN) (n=30/55, 55%), HER2+ (n=22/37, 59%). Clinical and biological items associated with pCR were BC subtype (p<0.001), T stage 0/I/II (p=0.008), higher Ki67 (p=0.005) and higher tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes levels (p=0.016). Univariate analysis showed that the following MRI features, oval or round shape (p=0.047), unifocality (p=0.026), non-spiculated margins (p=0.018), no associated non-mass enhancement (NME) (p = 0.024) and a lower MRI size (p = 0.031) were significantly associated with pCR. Unifocality and non-spiculated margins remained independently associated with pCR at multivariable analysis. Adding significant MRI features to clinicobiological variables in random forest classifiers significantly increased sensitivity (0.67 versus 0.62), specificity (0.69 versus 0.67) and precision (0.71 versus 0.67) for pCR prediction. Conclusion: Non-spiculated margins and unifocality are independently associated with pCR and can increase models performance to predict BC response to NAC. Clinical Relevance Statement: A multimodal approach integrating pretreatment MRI features with clinicobiological predictors, including TILs, could be employed to develop machine learning models for identifying patients at risk of non-response.

Fields such as remote sensing, requiring specialized tools (e.g., correction, spectral indices calculation), and multi-step procedures (e.g., numerous intermediate products and optional steps), significantly challenge generalized approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a novel agent design framework centered on a Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM). Specifically, HTAM moves beyond emulating social roles, instead structuring multi-agent systems into a logical hierarchy that mirrors the intrinsic task-dependency graph of a given domain. This task-centric architecture thus enforces procedural correctness and decomposes complex problems into sequential layers, where each layer's sub-agents operate on the outputs of the preceding layers. We instantiate this framework as EarthAgent, a multi-agent system tailored for complex geospatial analysis. To evaluate such complex planning capabilities, we build GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark of realistic, multi-step geospatial planning tasks. It is accompanied by a suite of carefully designed metrics to evaluate tool selection, path similarity, and logical completeness. Experiments show that EarthAgent substantially outperforms a range of established single- and multi-agent systems.

Traditional Demand-Driven Navigation (DDN) handles one need at a time but does not reflect the complexity of real-world tasks involving multiple needs and personal choices. To bridge this gap, we introduce Task-Preferenced Multi-Demand-Driven Navigation (TP-MDDN), a new benchmark for long-horizon navigation involving multiple sub-demands with explicit task preferences. To solve TP-MDDN, we propose AWMSystem, an autonomous decision-making system composed of three key modules: BreakLLM (instruction decomposition), LocateLLM (goal selection), and StatusMLLM (task monitoring). For spatial memory, we design MASMap, which combines 3D point cloud accumulation with 2D semantic mapping for accurate and efficient environmental understanding.

Existing datasets for tabular QA, such as WikiTableQuestions and FinQA, are overwhelmingly monolingual (English) and present tables in a digitally perfect, clean format.

Featuring nearly 60,000 QA pairs across 24 languages, MirageTVQA challenges models with tables that are not only multilingual but also visually imperfect, incorporating realistic noise to mimic scanned documents. Our evaluation of the leading VLMs reveals two primary failure points: a severe degradation in performance (over 35\\% drop for the best models) when faced with visual noise and a consistent English-first bias where reasoning abilities fail to transfer to other languages.

Well-known inverse kinematics (IK) techniques can provide mathematically exact solutions (when they exist) for joint configuration determination based solely on the fingertip pose, but often require post-hoc decision-making by considering the positions of all intermediate phalanges in the gripper's fingers, or rely on algorithms to numerically approximate solutions for more complex kinematics. In contrast, our method leverages machine learning to implicitly overcome these challenges. This is achieved through a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE), which takes point cloud data of key structural elements as input and reconstructs the corresponding joint configurations.

This compound degradation undermines traditional lens aberration correction yet remains underexplored. A major challenge is that conventional scattering models (e.g., for dehazing) fail to fit veiling glare due to its spatial-varying and depth-independent nature. Consequently, paired high-quality data are difficult to prepare via simulation, hindering application of data-driven veiling glare removal models. To this end, we propose VeilGen, a generative model that learns to simulate veiling glare by estimating its underlying optical transmission and glare maps in an unsupervised manner from target images, regularized by Stable Diffusion (SD)-based priors. VeilGen enables paired dataset generation with realistic compound degradation of optical aberrations and veiling glare, while also providing the estimated latent optical transmission and glare maps to guide the veiling glare removal process. We further introduce DeVeiler, a restoration network trained with a reversibility constraint, which utilizes the predicted latent maps to guide an inverse process of the learned scattering model.

A major bottleneck lies in the scarcity of large-scale, action-annotated data for dexterous skills, as teleoperation is difficult and costly. Human data, with its vast scale and diverse manipulation behaviors, provides rich priors for learning robotic actions. While prior works have explored leveraging human demonstrations, they are often constrained by limited scenarios and a large visual gap between human and robots. To eliminate these limitations, we propose METIS, a vision-language-action (VLA) model for dexterous manipulation pretrained on multi-source egocentric datasets. We first construct EgoAtlas, which integrates large-scale human and robotic data from multiple sources, all unified under a consistent action space. We further extract motion-aware dynamics, a compact and discretized motion representation, which provides efficient and expressive supervision for VLA training. Built upon them, METIS integrates reasoning and acting into a unified framework, enabling effective deployment to downstream dexterous manipulation tasks. Our method demonstrates exceptional dexterous manipulation capabilities, achieving highest average success rate in six real-world tasks. Experimental results also highlight the superior generalization and robustness to out-of-distribution scenarios.

Existing embodied benchmarks largely focus on passive, static household environments and evaluate only isolated capabilities, failing to capture holistic performance in dynamic, real-world complexity. To fill this gap, we present IndustryNav, the first dynamic industrial navigation benchmark for active spatial reasoning. IndustryNav leverages 12 manually created, high-fidelity Unity warehouse scenarios featuring dynamic objects and human movement. Our evaluation employs a PointGoal navigation pipeline that effectively combines egocentric vision with global odometry to assess holistic local-global planning. Crucially, we introduce the \"collision rate\" and \"warning rate\" metrics to measure safety-oriented behaviors and distance estimation. A comprehensive study of nine state-of-the-art VLLMs (including models such as GPT-5-mini, Claude-4.5, and Gemini-2.5) reveals that closed-source models maintain a consistent advantage; however, all agents exhibit notable deficiencies in robust path planning, collision avoidance and active exploration.

Hadi Sepanj", "Paul Fieguth"], "title": "Self-Supervised Learning by Curvature Alignment", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CV", "stat.ML"], "comment": null, "summary": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently advanced through non-contrastive methods that couple an invariance term with variance, covariance, or redundancy-reduction penalties. While such objectives shape first- and second-order statistics of the representation, they largely ignore the local geometry of the underlying data manifold. In this paper, we introduce CurvSSL, a curvature-regularized self-supervised learning framework, and its RKHS extension, kernel CurvSSL. Our approach retains a standard two-view encoder-projector architecture with a Barlow Twins-style redundancy-reduction loss on projected features, but augments it with a curvature-based regularizer. Each embedding is treated as a vertex whose $k$ nearest neighbors define a discrete curvature score via cosine interactions on the unit hypersphere; in the kernel variant, curvature is computed from a normalized local Gram matrix in an RKHS. These scores are aligned and decorrelated across augmentations by a Barlow-style loss on a curvature-derived matrix, encouraging both view invariance and consistency of local manifold bending. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with a ResNet-18 backbone show that curvature-regularized SSL yields competitive or improved linear evaluation performance compared to Barlow Twins and VICReg. Our results indicate that explicitly shaping local geometry is a simple and effective complement to purely statistical SSL regularizers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCurvSSL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f2\u7387\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u589e\u5f3a\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u53cc\u89c6\u56fe\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u6dfb\u52a0\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u6d41\u5f62\u5f2f\u66f2\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u975e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8868\u793a\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u548c\u4e8c\u9636\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5e95\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u4fdd\u7559\u6807\u51c6\u53cc\u89c6\u56fe\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u6295\u5f71\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528Barlow Twins\u98ce\u683c\u5197\u4f59\u51cf\u5c11\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4f46\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u66f2\u7387\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u3002\u901a\u8fc7k\u8fd1\u90bb\u8ba1\u7b97\u79bb\u6563\u66f2\u7387\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u5728\u6838\u53d8\u4f53\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528RKHS\u4e2d\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5c40\u90e8Gram\u77e9\u9635\u8ba1\u7b97\u66f2\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728MNIST\u548cCIFAR-10\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u66f2\u7387\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u6bd4Barlow Twins\u548cVICReg\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6216\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5851\u9020\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u7eaf\u7edf\u8ba1\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u8865\u5145\u3002"}}

While measures like BERTScore and MoverScore leverage contextual embeddings to address this limitation, they lack flexibility in balancing sentence-level and keyword-level semantics and ignore lexical similarity, which remains important. Large Language Model (LLM) based evaluators, though powerful, come with drawbacks like high costs, bias, inconsistency, and hallucinations. To address these issues, we introduce SMILE: Semantic Metric Integrating Lexical Exactness, a novel approach that combines sentence-level semantic understanding with keyword-level semantic understanding and easy keyword matching. This composite method balances lexical precision and semantic relevance, offering a comprehensive evaluation. Extensive benchmarks across text, image, and video QA tasks show SMILE is highly correlated with human judgments and computationally lightweight, bridging the gap between lexical and semantic evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "SMILE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u8bcd\u6c47\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5982ROUGE\u3001METEOR\u548cEM\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56n-gram\u8bcd\u6c47\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff1bBERTScore\u548cMoverScore\u867d\u7136\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5d4c\u5165\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff1bLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u6709\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSMILE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891QA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff0cSMILE\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f7b\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "SMILE\u5728\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e4b\u95f4\u67b6\u8d77\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
