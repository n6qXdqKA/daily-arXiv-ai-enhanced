This task requires\nMLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding\nnot only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual\nelements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex\ntask often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose\n{ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction.\nFirst, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To\naccomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of\nstructured instructions: description and difference. The description\ninstruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the\ndifference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference\nchart and the generated chart.

How can an\nAI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for\naccurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)\nfor 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The\naim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D\nreconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian\nSplatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each\ncandidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural\nuncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,\nnamed UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a\npredicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible\ncandidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many\nnatural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to\nlearn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the\nunderlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all\npreviously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate\nviewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these\nselected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the\nquality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.\nRemarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our\nmethod achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy.

However, text extraction from\nhistorical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2)\ntraining data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific\nmap styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene\nimages) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their\nflexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these\nmethods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting\nevery sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This\nis critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex\nbackgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a\nrough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for\nscanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel\nhyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around\nthe target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and\nrecognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn\nspatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across\ntext instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to\nautomatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text\nspotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+\noutperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical\nmaps, particularly for long and angled text.

Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful\nbalance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused\nimages effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the\nfunctional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited\ncapacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer\nfrom insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused\nimage quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage\ndiffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In\nStage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet\ncaptures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents\nmultilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the\nsubsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input\ninto the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability.\nThree key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from\ndifferent modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a\nhybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness,\ncolor, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The\nexperimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the\nproposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation\nmetrics.

During the learning\nstage, we design a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) to improve the pretrained\nencoder's capability to capture rich multi-scale visual information with very\nfew trainable parameters, thereby providing foundational inferences. In the\nrecall stage, we propose a dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and an inference\npattern reconstruction (IPR). These components fully leverage the latent\nrelationships between learned knowledge and current sample context to\nreconstruct the inference of camouflage patterns, thereby significantly\nimproving the model's understanding of camouflage scenes. Extensive experiments\non several widely used datasets demonstrate that our RetroMem significantly\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRetroMem\u7684\u56de\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3aCOD\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5386\u53f2\u77e5\u8bc6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5236\u4f2a\u88c5\u6a21\u5f0f\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709COD\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u673a\u5236\u83b7\u53d6\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4f2a\u88c5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u56de\u5fc6\u9636\u6bb5\uff09\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5bc6\u96c6\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff08DMA\uff09\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\uff08DMM\uff09\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u91cd\u5efa\uff08IPR\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRetroMem\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "RetroMem\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6574\u5408\u5386\u53f2\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f2a\u88c5\u573a\u666f\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Training high-performance models for this\ntask typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both\nexpensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution\nby iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby\nreducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the\nassumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to\ntarget classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often\ncontains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low\nefficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing\nAL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a\nsignificant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these\nchallenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for\npathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language\nModel (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine\ntarget and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select\nIn-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In\nsubsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes\nPrototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic\nSampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a\nquery, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public\npathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's\nperformance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several\nstate-of-the-art open-set AL methods.

However, this paradigm is both costly and\ndata-intensive. To address this, we propose RaCalNet, a novel framework that\neliminates the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise\nthe learning of refined radar measurements, resulting in a supervision density\nof merely around 1% compared to dense-supervised methods. Unlike previous\napproaches that associate radar points with broad image regions and rely\nheavily on dense labels, RaCalNet first recalibrates and refines sparse radar\npoints to construct accurate depth priors.

To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA\nLearning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion\nmodel, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency\nsimultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module\nto aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a\nConsistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from\ndegraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules\nand train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with\nthe temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases\nalternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent\nand detail-rich outputs.

Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing\nfeatures within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods,\nhowever, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or\npoor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to\nAccelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,\nper-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set\nof calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or\nreference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables\nfine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly\nto different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize\neffectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We\nevaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple\nmetrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,\nPartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.\nOn PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup\nfrom 2.35x to 2.58x.

However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on\nutilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in\nexisting time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for\nmodels to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data,\nsuch as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends\nbeyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed\npositional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical\ninformation into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key\ninnovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping\nphysics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding\nmechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and\nsequential order of tokens within the embedding space.

Recently, a variant of IL, called\nIn-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant\npolicies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform\na new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale\ndemonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined\nby hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally\ngenerates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To\nalleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning\nalgorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's\nt-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of\ninstant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP\ngenerates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an\nLLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial\nfor ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory\nagainst hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both\nsimulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\\%$ improvement in task success\nrates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks.

Recently,\nsingle-use endoscopes equipped with an ultra-compact analogue image sensor\nmeasuring less than 1mm x 1mm bring revolutionary advancements to medical\ndiagnosis. They reduce the structural redundancy and large capital expenditures\nassociated with reusable devices, eliminate the risk of patient infections\ncaused by inadequate disinfection, and alleviate patient suffering. However,\nthe limited photosensitive area results in reduced photon capture per pixel,\nrequiring higher photon sensitivity settings to maintain adequate brightness.\nIn high-contrast medical imaging scenarios, the small-sized sensor exhibits a\nconstrained dynamic range, making it difficult to simultaneously capture\ndetails in both highlights and shadows, and additional localized digital gain\nis required to compensate. Moreover, the simplified circuit design and analog\nsignal transmission introduce additional noise sources.

To\noperationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task\nenvironments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic\n3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building\nupon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark,\nwhich encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation,\nshopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across\nphysical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain\nintelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between\nstate-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both\nchallenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and\nweb-scale knowledge access.

We address these challenges with a neural dynamics\nframework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid\nrepresentation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion\ninformation while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of\nobjects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes,\nwhile the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity\nand enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual\nrendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of\ndeformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through\nexperiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse\nobjects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from\nsparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also\ngeneralizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators,\nparticularly in scenarios with limited camera views.
