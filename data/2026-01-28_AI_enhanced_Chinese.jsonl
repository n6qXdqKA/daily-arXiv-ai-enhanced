However, the increasing deployment of deep learning models has exposed them to various adversarial attacks, including backdoor attacks. This paper presents a novel dynamic mask-based backdoor attack method, specifically designed for object detection models. We exploit a dataset poisoning technique to embed a malicious trigger, rendering any models trained on this compromised dataset vulnerable to our backdoor attack. We particularly focus on a mushroom detection dataset to demonstrate the practical risks posed by such attacks on critical real-life domains. Our work also emphasizes the importance of creating a detailed backdoor attack scenario to illustrate the significant risks associated with the outsourcing practice. Our approach leverages SAM, a recent and powerful image segmentation AI model, to create masks for dynamic trigger placement, introducing a new and stealthy attack method. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our sophisticated attack scenario maintains high accuracy on clean data with the YOLOv7 object detection model while achieving high attack success rates on poisoned samples. Our approach surpasses traditional methods for backdoor injection, which are based on static and consistent patterns. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust countermeasures to protect deep learning models from these evolving adversarial threats.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6295\u6bd2\u5d4c\u5165\u6076\u610f\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u8611\u83c7\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u5404\u79cd\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u5728\u5173\u952e\u73b0\u5b9e\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u8611\u83c7\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u5916\u5305\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u63a9\u7801\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6295\u6bd2\u6280\u672f\u5d4c\u5165\u6076\u610f\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528SAM\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u63a9\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u653e\u7f6e\uff1b3\uff09\u9488\u5bf9YOLOv7\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1\uff09\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u6295\u6bd2\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff1b3\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u540e\u95e8\u6ce8\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5177\u9690\u853d\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u63a9\u7801\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u9c81\u68d2\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u7d27\u8feb\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u65ad\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u5a01\u80c1\u3002"}}

Recent advances in 3D Morphable Model (3DMM)-based facial reconstruction methods have achieved remarkable high-fidelity face estimation. However, on the one hand, they struggle to capture the entire head, including non-facial regions and background details in real time, which is an essential aspect for producing realistic, high-fidelity head avatars. On the other hand, recent approaches leveraging generative adversarial networks (GANs) for head avatar generation from videos can achieve high-quality reenactments but encounter limitations in reproducing fine-grained head details, such as wrinkles and hair textures. In addition, existing methods generally rely on a large amount of training data, and rarely focus on using only a simple selfie video to achieve avatar reenactment. To address these challenges, this study introduces a method for detailed head avatar reenactment using a selfie video. The approach combines 3DMMs with a StyleGAN-based generator. A detailed reconstruction model is proposed, incorporating mixed loss functions for foreground reconstruction and avatar image generation during adversarial training to recover high-frequency details.

Manual interpretation from this imagery is labor-intensive and error-prone, underscoring the need for automatic and reliable detection across varying scenes. Yet, such automatic detection is challenging due to severe background heterogeneity, dominant empty terrain (class imbalance), small or occluded targets, and wide variation in density and scale. To make the detection model (HerdNet) more robust to these challenges, a weakly supervised patch-level pretraining based on a detection network's architecture is proposed. The detection dataset includes five caribou herds distributed across Alaska. By learning from empty vs. non-empty labels in this dataset, the approach produces early weakly supervised knowledge for enhanced detection compared to HerdNet, which is initialized from generic weights. Accordingly, the patch-based pretrain network attained high accuracy on multi-herd imagery (2017) and on an independent year's (2019) test sets (F1: 93.7%/92.6%, respectively), enabling reliable mapping of regions containing animals to facilitate manual counting on large aerial imagery. Transferred to detection, initialization from weakly supervised pretraining yielded consistent gains over ImageNet weights on both positive patches (F1: 92.6%/93.5% vs. 89.3%/88.6%), and full-image counting (F1: 95.5%/93.3% vs. 91.5%/90.4%). Remaining limitations are false positives from animal-like background clutter and false negatives related to low animal density occlusions.

While effective detection methods exist, they often lack formal interpretability and may rely on implicit assumptions about fake content, potentially limiting robustness to distributional shifts. In this work, we introduce a rigorous, statistically grounded framework for fake image detection that focuses on producing a probability score interpretable with respect to the real-image population. Our method leverages the strengths of multiple existing detectors by combining training-free statistics. We compute p-values over a range of test statistics and aggregate them using classical statistical ensembling to assess alignment with the unified real-image distribution.

However, current approaches predominantly rely on unimodal RGB pre-training, overlooking the complex 3D geometry inherent to surgical environments. Although several architectures support multimodal or geometry-aware inputs in general computer vision, the benefits of incorporating depth information in surgical settings remain underexplored. We conduct a large-scale empirical study comparing eight ViT-based VFMs that differ in pre-training domain, learning objective, and input modality (RGB vs. RGB-D). For pre-training, we use a curated dataset of 1.4 million robotic surgical images paired with depth maps generated from an off-the-shelf network. We evaluate these models under both frozen-backbone and end-to-end fine-tuning protocols across eight surgical datasets spanning object detection, segmentation, depth estimation, and pose estimation. Our experiments yield several consistent findings. Models incorporating explicit geometric tokenization, such as MultiMAE, substantially outperform unimodal baselines across all tasks. Notably, geometric-aware pre-training enables remarkable data efficiency: models fine-tuned on just 25% of labeled data consistently surpass RGB-only models trained on the full dataset. Importantly, these gains require no architectural or runtime changes at inference; depth is used only during pre-training, making adoption straightforward. These findings suggest that multimodal pre-training offers a viable path towards building more capable surgical vision systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6bd4\u8f83\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u878d\u5165\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u79cd\u624b\u672f\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u6a21\u6001RGB\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u624b\u672f\u73af\u5883\u7684\u590d\u67423D\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u867d\u7136\u901a\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u6709\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6216\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u878d\u5165\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u597d\u5904\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e868\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eViT\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9886\u57df\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u6001\uff08RGB vs RGB-D\uff09\u4e0a\u6709\u6240\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b140\u4e07\u5f20\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u672f\u56fe\u50cf\u53ca\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u57288\u4e2a\u624b\u672f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u51bb\u7ed3\u4e3b\u5e72\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5fae\u8c03\u4e24\u79cd\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u5177\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982MultiMAE\uff09\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u90fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\uff1a\u4ec5\u752825%\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5c31\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684RGB-only\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6539\u8fdb\u65e0\u9700\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u66f4\u6539\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u4ec5\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u53d8\u5f97\u7b80\u5355\u76f4\u63a5\u3002"}}

Experiments on a segmentation model for embryo images shows that the proposed smart averaging strategy is able to tolerate two orders of magnitude stronger noise in the communication channels compared to conventional averaging, while still maintaining the accuracy of the final model.", "AI": {"tldr": "SplitFed\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u5e73\u5747\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u901a\u4fe1\u4fe1\u9053\u566a\u58f0\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u627f\u53d7\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u566a\u58f0", "motivation": "SplitFed\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5272\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u4fe1\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u4fe1\u9053\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u667a\u80fd\u5e73\u5747\u7b56\u7565\u7528\u4e8eSplitFed\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u901a\u4fe1\u4fe1\u9053\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u80fd\u529b", "result": "\u5728\u80da\u80ce\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u5e73\u5747\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5e73\u5747\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u627f\u53d7\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u4fe1\u9053\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u7ec8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "conclusion": "\u667a\u80fd\u5e73\u5747\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86SplitFed\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u901a\u4fe1\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6848"}}

We propose two approaches: a deterministic weighting scheme leveraging geometric properties like Euclidean distance and angular differences, and a cross-attention-based learning scheme that optimizes view weighting. Additionally, models can be further trained with our camera-weighting scheme to refine their understanding of view relevance and enhance synthesis quality. This mechanism is adaptable and can be integrated into various NVS algorithms, improving their ability to synthesize high-quality novel views.

However, large-angle redirection is inherently ill-posed: a monocular video captures only a narrow spatio-temporal view of a dynamic 3D scene, providing highly partial observations of the underlying 4D world. The key challenge is therefore to recover a complete and coherent representation from this limited input, with consistent geometry and motion. While recent diffusion-based methods achieve impressive results, they often break down under large-angle viewpoint changes far from the original trajectory, where missing visual grounding leads to severe geometric ambiguity and temporal inconsistency. To address this, we present FreeOrbit4D, an effective training-free framework that tackles this geometric ambiguity by recovering a geometry-complete 4D proxy as structural grounding for video generation. We obtain this proxy by decoupling foreground and background reconstructions: we unproject the monocular video into a static background and geometry-incomplete foreground point clouds in a unified global space, then leverage an object-centric multi-view diffusion model to synthesize multi-view images and reconstruct geometry-complete foreground point clouds in canonical object space. By aligning the canonical foreground point cloud to the global scene space via dense pixel-synchronized 3D--3D correspondences and projecting the geometry-complete 4D proxy onto target camera viewpoints, we provide geometric scaffolds that guide a conditional video diffusion model. Extensive experiments show that FreeOrbit4D produces more faithful redirected videos under challenging large-angle trajectories, and our geometry-complete 4D proxy further opens a potential avenue for practical applications such as edit propagation and 4D data generation.

Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful distribution-free framework for constructing statistically valid prediction intervals. However, standard applications in segmentation often ignore anatomical context, resulting in fragmented, spatially incoherent, and over-segmented prediction sets that limit clinical utility. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes Random-Walk Conformal Prediction (RW-CP), a model-agnostic framework which can be added on top of any segmentation method. RW-CP enforces spatial coherence to generate anatomically valid sets. Our method constructs a k-nearest neighbour graph from pre-trained vision foundation model features and applies a random walk to diffuse uncertainty. The random walk diffusion regularizes the non-conformity scores, making the prediction sets less sensitive to the conformal calibration parameter $\u03bb$, ensuring more stable and continuous anatomical boundaries.

Chang"], "title": "NuiWorld: Exploring a Scalable Framework for End-to-End Controllable World Generation", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "comment": null, "summary": "World generation is a fundamental capability for applications like video games, simulation, and robotics. However, existing approaches face three main obstacles: controllability, scalability, and efficiency. End-to-end scene generation models have been limited by data scarcity. While object-centric generation approaches rely on fixed resolution representations, degrading fidelity for larger scenes. Training-free approaches, while flexible, are often slow and computationally expensive at inference time. We present NuiWorld, a framework that attempts to address these challenges. To overcome data scarcity, we propose a generative bootstrapping strategy that starts from a few input images. Leveraging recent 3D reconstruction and expandable scene generation techniques, we synthesize scenes of varying sizes and layouts, producing enough data to train an end-to-end model. Furthermore, our framework enables controllability through pseudo sketch labels, and demonstrates a degree of generalization to previously unseen sketches. Our approach represents scenes as a collection of variable scene chunks, which are compressed into a flattened vector-set representation. This significantly reduces the token length for large scenes, enabling consistent geometric fidelity across scenes sizes while improving training and inference efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "NuiWorld\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u89e3\u51b33D\u4e16\u754c\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u53d8\u573a\u666f\u5757\u548c\u6241\u5e73\u5316\u5411\u91cf\u96c6\u8868\u793a\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e16\u754c\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\uff1a\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u5229\u75283D\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u5408\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5e03\u5c40\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8db3\u591f\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4f2a\u8349\u56fe\u6807\u7b7e\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u53ef\u53d8\u573a\u666f\u5757\u7684\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u6241\u5e73\u5316\u5411\u91cf\u96c6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5e03\u5c40\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u8db3\u591f\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f2a\u8349\u56fe\u6807\u7b7e\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u8349\u56fe\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6241\u5e73\u5316\u5411\u91cf\u96c6\u8868\u793a\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0b\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "NuiWorld\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e16\u754c\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u514b\u670d\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u53d8\u573a\u666f\u5757\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u6e38\u620f\u3001\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Prior multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG) systems improve factual grounding but lack an internal policy for when and how to retrieve. We propose PixSearch, the first end-to-end Segmenting Large Multimodal Model (LMM) that unifies region-level perception and retrieval-augmented reasoning. During encoding, PixSearch emits <search> tokens to trigger retrieval, selects query modalities (text, image, or region), and generates pixel-level masks that directly serve as visual queries, eliminating the reliance on modular pipelines (detectors, segmenters, captioners, etc.). A two-stage supervised fine-tuning regimen with search-interleaved supervision teaches retrieval timing and query selection while preserving segmentation ability. On egocentric and entity-centric VQA benchmarks, PixSearch substantially improves factual consistency and generalization, yielding a 19.7% relative gain in accuracy on CRAG-MM compared to whole image retrieval, while retaining competitive reasoning performance on various VQA and text-only QA tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "PixSearch\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u5206\u5272\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7<search>\u4ee4\u724c\u89e6\u53d1\u68c0\u7d22\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u63a9\u7801\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347VQA\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u90e8\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3001\u5206\u5272\u5668\u3001\u63cf\u8ff0\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4e8b\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPixSearch\uff1a1\uff09\u7f16\u7801\u65f6\u53d1\u51fa<search>\u4ee4\u724c\u89e6\u53d1\u68c0\u7d22\uff1b2\uff09\u9009\u62e9\u67e5\u8be2\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u6216\u533a\u57df\uff09\uff1b3\uff09\u751f\u6210\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u63a9\u7801\u76f4\u63a5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u67e5\u8be2\uff1b4\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u641c\u7d22\u4ea4\u9519\u76d1\u7763\u6559\u6388\u68c0\u7d22\u65f6\u673a\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5206\u5272\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316VQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPixSearch\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728CRAG-MM\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u6574\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u83b7\u5f9719.7%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5404\u79cdVQA\u548c\u7eaf\u6587\u672cQA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "PixSearch\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7edf\u4e00\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709MM-RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u90e8\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We introduce m2sv, a scalable benchmark for map-to-street-view spatial reasoning that asks models to infer camera viewing direction by aligning a north-up overhead map with a Street View image captured at the same real-world intersection. We release m2sv-20k, a geographically diverse benchmark with controlled ambiguity, along with m2sv-sft-11k, a curated set of structured reasoning traces for supervised fine-tuning.\n  Despite strong performance on existing multimodal benchmarks, the best evaluated VLM achieves only 65.2% accuracy on m2sv, far below the human baseline of 95%.

Code is available at https://github.com/Luffy03/GF-Screen", "summary": "Pan-cancer screening in large-scale CT scans remains challenging for existing AI methods, primarily due to the difficulty of localizing diverse types of tiny lesions in large CT volumes. The extreme foreground-background imbalance significantly hinders models from focusing on diseased regions, while redundant focus on healthy regions not only decreases the efficiency but also increases false positives. Inspired by radiologists' glance and focus diagnostic strategy, we introduce GF-Screen, a Glance and Focus reinforcement learning framework for pan-cancer screening. GF-Screen employs a Glance model to localize the diseased regions and a Focus model to precisely segment the lesions, where segmentation results of the Focus model are leveraged to reward the Glance model via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, the Glance model crops a group of sub-volumes from the entire CT volume and learns to select the sub-volumes with lesions for the Focus model to segment. Given that the selecting operation is non-differentiable for segmentation training, we propose to employ the segmentation results to reward the Glance model. To optimize the Glance model, we introduce a novel group relative learning paradigm, which employs group relative comparison to prioritize high-advantage predictions and discard low-advantage predictions within sub-volume groups, not only improving efficiency but also reducing false positives. In this way, for the first time, we effectively extend cutting-edge RL techniques to tackle the specific challenges in pan-cancer screening. Extensive experiments on 16 internal and 7 external datasets across 9 lesion types demonstrated the effectiveness of GF-Screen. Notably, GF-Screen leads the public validation leaderboard of MICCAI FLARE25 pan-cancer challenge, surpassing the FLARE24 champion solution by a large margin (+25.6% DSC and +28.2% NSD).", "AI": {"tldr": "GF-Screen\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21CT\u626b\u63cf\u4e2d\u6cdb\u764c\u7b5b\u67e5\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\"\u4e00\u77a5\u4e00\u805a\u7126\"\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Glance\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u75c5\u7076\u533a\u57df\uff0cFocus\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u5272\u75c5\u7076\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1Glance\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u4f53\u79efCT\u4e2d\u5fae\u5c0f\u75c5\u7076\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21CT\u626b\u63cf\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6cdb\u764c\u7b5b\u67e5\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u4e3a\u5728\u5927\u4f53\u79efCT\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5404\u79cd\u5fae\u5c0f\u75c5\u7076\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u6781\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u666f-\u80cc\u666f\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u963b\u788d\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u75c5\u53d8\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u5065\u5eb7\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u4ec5\u964d\u4f4e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u589e\u52a0\u5047\u9633\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGF-Screen\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) Glance\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u6574\u4e2aCT\u4f53\u79ef\u4e2d\u88c1\u526a\u4e00\u7ec4\u5b50\u4f53\u79ef\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u9009\u62e9\u5305\u542b\u75c5\u7076\u7684\u5b50\u4f53\u79ef\uff1b2) Focus\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u5272\u75c5\u7076\uff1b3) \u5229\u7528Focus\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1Glance\u6a21\u578b\uff1b4) \u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5185\u76f8\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u4f18\u52bf\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e22\u5f03\u4f4e\u4f18\u52bf\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u572816\u4e2a\u5185\u90e8\u548c7\u4e2a\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf99\u79cd\u75c5\u7076\u7c7b\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86GF-Screen\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u5728MICCAI FLARE25\u6cdb\u764c\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6392\u884c\u699c\u4e0a\u9886\u5148\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u8d85\u8d8aFLARE24\u51a0\u519b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff08+25.6% DSC\u548c+28.2% NSD\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "GF-Screen\u9996\u6b21\u6709\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u524d\u6cbf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6cdb\u764c\u7b5b\u67e5\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\"\u4e00\u77a5\u4e00\u805a\u7126\"\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5927\u4f53\u79efCT\u4e2d\u5fae\u5c0f\u75c5\u7076\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5047\u9633\u6027\u3002"}}

We propose FBSDiff, a novel framework adapting off-the-shelf T2I diffusion model into the I2I paradigm from a fresh frequency-domain perspective. Through dynamic frequency band substitution of diffusion features, FBSDiff realizes versatile and highly controllable text-driven I2I in a plug-and-play manner (without need for model training, fine-tuning, or online optimization), allowing appearance-guided, layout-guided, and contour-guided I2I translation by progressively substituting low-frequency band, mid-frequency band, and high-frequency band of latent diffusion features, respectively. In addition, FBSDiff flexibly enables continuous control over I2I correlation intensity simply by tuning the bandwidth of the substituted frequency band. To further promote image translation efficiency, flexibility, and functionality, we propose FBSDiff++ which improves upon FBSDiff mainly in three aspects: (1) accelerate inference speed by a large margin (8.9$\\times$ speedup in inference) with refined model architecture; (2) improve the Frequency Band Substitution module to allow for input source images of arbitrary resolution and aspect ratio; (3) extend model functionality to enable localized image manipulation and style-specific content creation with only subtle adjustments to the core method. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify superiority of FBSDiff++ in I2I translation visual quality, efficiency, versatility, and controllability compared to related advanced approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "FBSDiff/FBSDiff++\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u57df\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9891\u5e26\u66ff\u6362\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f00\u59cb\u5173\u6ce8\u5176\u5411\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6e90\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u5171\u540c\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFBSDiff\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u9891\u57df\u89c6\u89d2\u5c06\u73b0\u6210\u7684T2I\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u914d\u5230I2I\u8303\u5f0f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u66ff\u6362\u6269\u6563\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u9891\u5e26\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3002FBSDiff++\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\uff1a1\uff09\u5927\u5e45\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff088.9\u500d\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u6539\u8fdb\u9891\u5e26\u66ff\u6362\u6a21\u5757\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u5bbd\u9ad8\u6bd4\uff1b3\uff09\u6269\u5c55\u529f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u7279\u5b9a\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86FBSDiff++\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6548\u7387\u3001\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FBSDiff++\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u57df\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u521b\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Most domain generalization (DG) methods based on domain adversarial learning (DAL) pay much attention to learn domain-invariant information, but often overlook the potential non-causal factors. We unveil two critical causes: 1) The domain discriminator-based DAL method is subject to the extremely sparse domain label, i.e., assigning only one domain label to each dataset, thus can only associate explicit non-causal factor, which is incredibly limited. 2) The non-causal factors, induced by unidentified data bias, are excessively implicit and cannot be solely discerned by conventional DAL paradigm. Based on these key findings, inspired by the Granular-Ball perspective, we propose an improved DAL method, i.e., GB-DAL. The proposed GB-DAL utilizes Prototype-based Granular Ball Splitting (PGBS) module to generate more dense domains from limited datasets, akin to more fine-grained granular balls, indicating more potential non-causal factors. Inspired by adversarial perturbations akin to non-causal factors, we propose a Simulated Non-causal Factors (SNF) module as a means of data augmentation to reduce the implicitness of non-causal factors, and facilitate the training of GB-DAL.

These failures stem from two compounding factors: such components are rare in training data, yet they share identical local geometry with dominant structures like pipes. This work identifies a dual crisis unique to industrial 3D data extreme class imbalance 215:1 ratio compounded by geometric ambiguity where most tail classes share cylindrical primitives with head classes. Existing frequency-based re-weighting methods address statistical imbalance but cannot resolve geometric ambiguity. We propose spatial context constraints that leverage neighborhood prediction consistency to disambiguate locally similar structures. Our approach extends the Class-Balanced (CB) Loss framework with two architecture-agnostic mechanisms: (1) Boundary-CB, an entropy-based constraint that emphasizes ambiguous boundaries, and (2) Density-CB, a density-based constraint that compensates for scan-dependent variations. Both integrate as plug-and-play modules without network modifications, requiring only loss function replacement. On the Industrial3D dataset (610M points from water treatment facilities), our method achieves 55.74% mIoU with 21.7% relative improvement on tail-class performance (29.59% vs. 24.32% baseline) while preserving head-class accuracy (88.14%).

Exposure correction still faces two critical challenges: (1) the ignorance of object-wise regional semantic information causes the color shift artifacts; (2) real-world exposure images generally have no ground-truth labels, and its labeling entails massive manual editing. To tackle the challenges, we propose a new unsupervised semantic-aware exposure correction network. It contains an adaptive semantic-aware fusion module, which effectively fuses the semantic information extracted from a pre-trained Fast Segment Anything Model into a shared image feature space. Then the fused features are used by our multi-scale residual spatial mamba group to restore the details and adjust the exposure. To avoid manual editing, we propose a pseudo-ground truth generator guided by CLIP, which is fine-tuned to automatically identify exposure situations and instruct the tailored corrections. Also, we leverage the rich priors from the FastSAM and CLIP to develop a semantic-prompt consistency loss to enforce semantic consistency and image-prompt alignment for unsupervised training.

However, standard convolutional architectures often yield topologically disjointed segmentations, characterized by gaps and discontinuities that render reliable graph-based clinical analysis impossible despite high pixel-level accuracy. To address this, we introduce a topology-aware framework engineered to maintain vascular connectivity. Our architecture fuses a Topological Feature Fusion Module (TFFM) that maps local feature representations into a latent graph space, deploying Graph Attention Networks to capture global structural dependencies often missed by fixed receptive fields. Furthermore, we drive the learning process with a hybrid objective function, coupling Tversky loss for class imbalance with soft clDice loss to explicitly penalize topological disconnects. Evaluation on the Fundus-AVSeg dataset reveals state-of-the-art performance, achieving a combined Dice score of 90.97% and a 95% Hausdorff Distance of 3.50 pixels.

To address this, we propose the Guided Texture and Feature Modulation Network (GTFMN), a novel framework that decouples the LLSR task into two sub-problems: illumination estimation and texture restoration. First, our network employs a dedicated Illumination Stream whose purpose is to predict a spatially varying illumination map that accurately captures lighting distribution. Further, this map is utilized as an explicit guide within our novel Illumination Guided Modulation Block (IGM Block) to dynamically modulate features in the Texture Stream. This mechanism achieves spatially adaptive restoration, enabling the network to intensify enhancement in poorly lit regions while preserving details in well-exposed areas.

However, existing approaches rely on fixed Gaussian noise to construct the source trajectory, leading to biased trajectory dynamics and causing structural degradation or quality loss. To address this, we introduce SNR-Edit, a training-free framework achieving faithful Latent Trajectory Correction via adaptive noise control. Mechanistically, SNR-Edit uses structure-aware noise rectification to inject segmentation constraints into the initial noise, anchoring the stochastic component of the source trajectory to the real image's implicit inversion position and reducing trajectory drift during source--target transport. This lightweight modification yields smoother latent trajectories and ensures high-fidelity structural preservation without requiring model tuning or inversion.

While test-time defenses are promising, existing methods fail to provide sufficient robustness against strong attacks and are often hampered by high inference latency and task-specific applicability. To address these limitations, we start by investigating the intrinsic properties of AEs, which reveals that AEs exhibit severe feature inconsistency under progressive frequency attenuation. We further attribute this to the model's inherent spectral bias. Leveraging this insight, we propose an efficient test-time defense named Contrastive Spectral Rectification (CSR). CSR optimizes a rectification perturbation to realign the input with the natural manifold under a spectral-guided contrastive objective, which is applied input-adaptively. Extensive experiments across 16 classification benchmarks demonstrate that CSR outperforms the SOTA by an average of 18.1% against strong AutoAttack with modest inference overhead. Furthermore, CSR exhibits broad applicability across diverse visual tasks.

PCB inspection poses unique challenges due to densely packed components, complex wiring structures, and subtle defect patterns that require specialized domain expertise. However, a high-quality, unified vision-language benchmark for quantitatively evaluating MLLMs across PCB inspection tasks remains absent, stemming not only from limited data availability but also from fragmented datasets and inconsistent standardization. To fill this gap, we propose UniPCB, the first unified vision-language benchmark for open-ended PCB quality inspection. UniPCB is built via a systematic pipeline that curates and standardizes data from disparate sources across three annotated scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce PCB-GPT, an MLLM trained on a new instruction dataset generated by this pipeline, utilizing a novel progressive curriculum that mimics the learning process of human experts. Evaluations on the UniPCB benchmark show that while existing MLLMs falter on domain-specific tasks, PCB-GPT establishes a new baseline. Notably, it more than doubles the performance on fine-grained defect localization compared to the strongest competitors, with significant advantages in localization and analysis.

Our method reframes segmentation as a simple sequence generation problem: the model directly predicts sequences of points (textual coordinates) delineating object boundaries, entirely within its language space. To achieve high fidelity, we introduce a two-stage SF$\\to$RL training pipeline, where Reinforcement Learning with an IoU-based reward refines the point sequences to accurately match ground-truth contours. We find that the standard MLLM architecture possesses a strong, inherent capacity for low-level perception that can be unlocked without any specialized architecture. On segmentation benchmarks, SimpleSeg achieves performance that is comparable to, and often surpasses, methods relying on complex, task-specific designs.

In our work, we introduce Video Connecting, an innovative task that aims to generate smooth intermediate video content between given start and end clips. However, the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks has hindered the development of this task. To bridge this gap, we proposed VC-Bench, a novel benchmark specifically designed for video connecting. It includes 1,579 high-quality videos collected from public platforms, covering 15 main categories and 72 subcategories to ensure diversity and structure. VC-Bench focuses on three core aspects: Video Quality Score VQS, Start-End Consistency Score SECS, and Transition Smoothness Score TSS. Together, they form a comprehensive framework that moves beyond conventional quality-only metrics. We evaluated multiple state-of-the-art video generation models on VC-Bench.

As challenges remain in extracting 3D modal features and bridging the gap between different modalities, we propose TIGaussian, a framework that harnesses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) characteristics to strengthen cross-modality alignment through multi-branch 3DGS tokenizer and modality-specific 3D feature alignment strategies. Specifically, our multi-branch 3DGS tokenizer decouples the intrinsic properties of 3DGS structures into compact latent representations, enabling more generalizable feature extraction. To further bridge the modality gap, we develop a bidirectional cross-modal alignment strategies: a multi-view feature fusion mechanism that leverages diffusion priors to resolve perspective ambiguity in image-3D alignment, while a text-3D projection module adaptively maps 3D features to text embedding space for better text-3D alignment.

Detecting such fake content reliably is an urgent challenge. While deep learning approaches dominate current literature, handcrafted features remain attractive for their interpretability, efficiency, and generalizability. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of handcrafted descriptors, including raw pixels, color histograms, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), and wavelet features, on the CIFAKE dataset of real versus synthetic images. Using 50,000 training and 10,000 test samples, we benchmark seven classifiers ranging from Logistic Regression to advanced gradient-boosted ensembles (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost). Results demonstrate that LightGBM consistently outperforms alternatives, achieving PR-AUC 0.9879, ROC-AUC 0.9878, F1 0.9447, and a Brier score of 0.0414 with mixed features, representing strong gains in calibration and discrimination over simpler descriptors. Across three configurations (baseline, advanced, mixed), performance improves monotonically, confirming that combining diverse handcrafted features yields substantial benefit.

Due to the limited number of labeled samples in the target domain, there can be intrinsic similarity of classes in the feature space, which may result in biased predictions, even when the model is trained on a balanced dataset. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view consistency framework, which includes two views for training strongly augmented data. One is a debiasing strategy for correcting class-wise prediction probabilities according to the prediction performance of the model. The other involves leveraging pseudo-negative labels derived from the model predictions.

However, monocular camera-based 3D detection suffers from depth ambiguity and reduced robustness under challenging conditions. Radar provides complementary advantages such as resilience to poor lighting and adverse weather, but its sparsity and low resolution limit its direct use in detection frameworks. This motivates the need for effective Radar-camera fusion with improved preprocessing and depth estimation strategies. We propose an end-to-end framework that enhances monocular 3D object detection through two key components. First, we introduce InstaRadar, an instance segmentation-guided expansion method that leverages pre-trained segmentation masks to enhance Radar density and semantic alignment, producing a more structured representation. InstaRadar achieves state-of-the-art results in Radar-guided depth estimation, showing its effectiveness in generating high-quality depth features. Second, we integrate the pre-trained RCDPT into the BEVDepth framework as a replacement for its depth module. With InstaRadar-enhanced inputs, the RCDPT integration consistently improves 3D detection performance. Overall, these components yield steady gains over the baseline BEVDepth model, demonstrating the effectiveness of InstaRadar and the advantage of explicit depth supervision in 3D object detection. Although the framework lags behind Radar-camera fusion models that directly extract BEV features, since Radar serves only as guidance rather than an independent feature stream, this limitation highlights potential for improvement. Future work will extend InstaRadar to point cloud-like representations and integrate a dedicated Radar branch with temporal cues for enhanced BEV fusion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faInstaRadar\u589e\u5f3a\u96f7\u8fbe\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408RCDPT\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u5757\u6539\u8fdbBEVDepth\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u76ee3D\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u5355\u76ee\u76f8\u673a3D\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b58\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u6076\u52a3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96f7\u8fbe\u867d\u80fd\u8865\u5145\u4f46\u7a00\u758f\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe-\u76f8\u673a\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565", "method": "1.

Conventional training treats all pixels equally, leading to unstable optimization during early epochs when predictions are unreliable. We argue that this instability hinders convergence toward Pareto-optimal solutions and propose a region-wise curriculum strategy that prioritizes learning from certain regions and gradually incorporates uncertain ones, reducing gradient variance. Methodologically, we introduce a Pareto-consistent loss that balances trade-offs between regional uncertainties by adaptively reshaping the loss landscape and constraining convergence dynamics between interior and boundary regions; this guides the model toward Pareto-approximate solutions. To address boundary ambiguity, we further develop a fuzzy labeling mechanism that maintains binary confidence in non-boundary areas while enabling smooth transitions near boundaries, stabilizing gradients, and expanding flat regions in the loss surface. Experiments on brain metastasis and non-metastatic tumor segmentation show consistent improvements across multiple configurations, with our method outperforming traditional crisp-set approaches in all tumor subregions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u533a\u57df\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u4e00\u81f4\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u786e\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u3001\u9010\u6b65\u7eb3\u5165\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u7cca\u6807\u8bb0\u673a\u5236\u5904\u7406\u8fb9\u754c\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\uff0c\u8fb9\u754c\u533a\u57df\u6bd4\u5185\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u66f4\u5177\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u50cf\u7d20\u4e00\u89c6\u540c\u4ec1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u3002", "method": "1. \u533a\u57df\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u4f18\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u786e\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u7eb3\u5165\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\uff1b2. \u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u4e00\u81f4\u635f\u5931\uff1a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u5851\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u533a\u57df\u95f4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f\u5185\u90e8\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6536\u655b\u52a8\u6001\uff1b3. \u6a21\u7cca\u6807\u8bb0\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u5728\u975e\u8fb9\u754c\u533a\u57df\u4fdd\u6301\u4e8c\u5143\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u9644\u8fd1\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u68af\u5ea6\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u635f\u5931\u8868\u9762\u7684\u5e73\u5766\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8111\u8f6c\u79fb\u7624\u548c\u975e\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u80bf\u7624\u5b50\u533a\u57df\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u96c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u533a\u57df\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u4e00\u81f4\u635f\u5931\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u5747\u5300\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u5e73\u8861\u533a\u57df\u95f4\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We used specific keywords to extract relevant images, and classified them using a novel hybrid method that combined deep learning-based image modality classification with figure caption analyses. Validation on 651 manually annotated images demonstrated the robustness of our workflow, with an F-score of 89.6\\% for the deep learning approach, 61.0\\% for the keyword-based retrieval method, and 90.4\\% for the hybrid approach.

This limitation stems from existing AIGI detection benchmarks, which, despite featuring a broad collection of synthetic images, remain restricted in their coverage of artifact diversity and lack detailed, localized annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce a fine-grained benchmark towards eXplainable AI-Generated image Detection, named X-AIGD, which provides pixel-level, categorized annotations of perceptual artifacts, spanning low-level distortions, high-level semantics, and cognitive-level counterfactuals. These comprehensive annotations facilitate fine-grained interpretability evaluation and deeper insight into model decision-making processes. Our extensive investigation using X-AIGD provides several key insights: (1) Existing AIGI detectors demonstrate negligible reliance on perceptual artifacts, even at the most basic distortion level. (2) While AIGI detectors can be trained to identify specific artifacts, they still substantially base their judgment on uninterpretable features. (3) Explicitly aligning model attention with artifact regions can increase the interpretability and generalization of detectors.

Despite the promise of leveraging 2D diffusion priors, existing methods suffer from spatial blindness and rely on predefined trajectories that fail to exploit the inner relationships among salient objects. Consequently, these approaches are unable to comprehend the semantic layout, preventing them from exploring the scene adaptively to infer occluded content. Moreover, current inpainting models operate in 2D image space, struggling to plausibly fill holes caused by camera motion. To address these limitations, we propose RoamScene3D, a novel framework that bridges the gap between semantic guidance and spatial generation. Our method reasons about the semantic relations among objects and produces consistent and photorealistic scenes. Specifically, we employ a vision-language model (VLM) to construct a scene graph that encodes object relations, guiding the camera to perceive salient object boundaries and plan an adaptive roaming trajectory. Furthermore, to mitigate the limitations of static 2D priors, we introduce a Motion-Injected Inpainting model that is fine-tuned on a synthetic panoramic dataset integrating authentic camera trajectories, making it adaptive to camera motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that with semantic reasoning and geometric constraints, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in producing consistent and photorealistic scenes.

However, achieving accurate segmentation remains a significant challenge due to class imbalance, ambiguous boundaries, and noise interference in ultrasound images, compounded by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. Current research on PSFH segmentation predominantly relies on CNN and Transformer architectures, leaving the potential of more powerful models underexplored. In this work, we propose a Dual-Student and Teacher framework combining CNN and SAM (DSTCS), which integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into a dual student-teacher architecture.

(1)Vision (human eyes): we equip the virtual human with a Dynamic Scene-Aware Navigation, which continuously perceives changes in the surrounding environment and adaptively predicts the next waypoint. (2)Memory (human brain): we equip the virtual human with a Hierarchical Experience Memory, which stores and updates experiential data accumulated during training. This allows the model to leverage prior knowledge during inference for context-aware motion priming, thereby enhancing both motion quality and generalization. (3) Control (human body): we equip the virtual human with Human-Scene Interaction Diffusion Model, which generates high-fidelity interaction motions conditioned on multimodal inputs. To evaluate performance in dynamic scenes, we extend the existing static human-scene interaction datasets to construct a dynamic benchmark, Dyn-Scenes.

In LLMs, top-p/top-k sampling strategies work exceptionally well: language tokens have high semantic density and low redundancy, so a fixed size of token candidates already strikes a balance between semantic accuracy and generation diversity. In contrast, video tokens have low semantic density and high spatio-temporal redundancy. This mismatch makes static top-k/top-p strategies ineffective for video decoders: they either introduce unnecessary randomness for low-uncertainty regions (static backgrounds) or get stuck in early errors for high-uncertainty regions (foreground objects). Prediction errors will accumulate as more frames are generated and eventually severely degrade long-horizon quality. To address this, we propose Entropy-Guided k-Guard (ENkG) sampling, a simple yet effective strategy that adapts sampling to token-wise dispersion, quantified by the entropy of each token's predicted distribution.

To robustly handle these heterogeneous settings, we develop a two-stage solution. In the first round, we use reverse per-Gaussian parallel optimization and compact forward splatting based on Taming-GS and Speedy-splat, load-balanced tiling, an anchor-based Neural-Gaussian representation enabling rapid convergence with fewer learnable parameters, initialization from monocular depth and partially from feed-forward 3DGS models, and a global pose refinement module for noisy SLAM trajectories. In the final round, the accurate COLMAP poses change the optimization landscape; we disable pose refinement, revert from Neural-Gaussians back to standard 3DGS to eliminate MLP inference overhead, introduce multi-view consistency-guided Gaussian splitting inspired by Fast-GS, and introduce a depth estimator to supervise the rendered depth. Together, these techniques enable high-fidelity reconstruction under a strict one-minute budget.

However, existing generative models largely rely on weak conditioning signals, such as labels or text, which lack anatomical grounding and often produce biologically implausible outputs. To this end, we introduce Cor2Vox, a cortex-grounded generative framework for brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) synthesis that ties image generation to continuous structural priors of the cerebral cortex. It leverages high-resolution cortical surfaces to guide a 3D shape-to-image Brownian bridge diffusion process, enabling topologically faithful synthesis and precise control over underlying anatomies. To support the generation of new, realistic brain shapes, we developed a large-scale statistical shape model of cortical morphology derived from over 33,000 UK Biobank scans. We validated the fidelity of Cor2Vox based on traditional image quality metrics, advanced cortical surface reconstruction, and whole-brain segmentation quality, outperforming many baseline methods. Across three applications, namely (i) anatomically consistent synthesis, (ii) simulation of progressive gray matter atrophy, and (iii) harmonization of in-house frontotemporal dementia scans with public datasets, Cor2Vox preserved fine-grained cortical morphology at the sub-voxel level, exhibiting remarkable robustness to variations in cortical geometry and disease phenotype without retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "Cor2Vox\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u76ae\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8111MRI\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u76ae\u5c42\u8868\u9762\u5148\u9a8c\u6307\u5bfc3D\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5408\u6210", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u5f71\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u7b7e\u6216\u6587\u672c\u7b49\u5f31\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e0a\u4e0d\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u4e0e\u5927\u8111\u76ae\u5c42\u8fde\u7eed\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u7ed1\u5b9a\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCor2Vox\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u76ae\u5c42\u8868\u9762\u6307\u5bfc3D\u5f62\u72b6\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5e03\u6717\u6865\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e33,000\u591a\u4e2aUK Biobank\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u76ae\u5c42\u5f62\u6001\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f62\u72b6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3001\u76ae\u5c42\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u5168\u8111\u5206\u5272\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff08\u89e3\u5256\u4e00\u81f4\u5408\u6210\u3001\u7070\u8d28\u840e\u7f29\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u534f\u8c03\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e9a\u4f53\u7d20\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u76ae\u5c42\u5f62\u6001\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Cor2Vox\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u76ae\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u7ed1\u5b9a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u62d3\u6251\u5fe0\u5b9e\u4e14\u89e3\u5256\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8111MRI\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5bf9\u76ae\u5c42\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u75be\u75c5\u8868\u578b\u53d8\u5316\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Current generative approaches, while capable of synthesizing realistic textures, often suffer from information asymmetry -- the intrinsic disparity between the information-sparse low quality inputs and the information-dense high quality outputs. This imbalance leads to a one-to-many mapping, where insufficient constraints result in stochastic uncertainty and hallucinatory artifacts. To bridge this gap, we present \\textbf{Pref-Restore}, a hierarchical framework that integrates discrete semantic logic with continuous texture generation to achieve deterministic, preference-aligned restoration. Our methodology fundamentally addresses this information disparity through two complementary strategies: (1) Augmenting Input Density: We employ an auto-regressive integrator to reformulate textual instructions into dense latent queries, injecting high-level semantic stability to constrain the degraded signals; (2) Pruning Output Distribution: We pioneer the integration of on-policy reinforcement learning directly into the diffusion restoration loop. By transforming human preferences into differentiable constraints, we explicitly penalize stochastic deviations, thereby sharpening the posterior distribution toward the desired high-fidelity outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Pref-Restore achieves state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Using time-of-flight ranging between wireless nodes, our method eliminates the need for external cameras, enabling robust operation in uncontrolled and outdoor environments. Unlike traditional optical or inertial systems, our approach is shape-invariant and resilient to environmental constraints such as lighting and magnetic interference. At the core of our system is Wild-Poser (WiP for short), a compact, real-time Transformer-based architecture that directly predicts 3D joint positions from noisy or corrupted PWD measurements, which can later be used for joint rotation reconstruction via learned methods. WiP generalizes across subjects of varying morphologies, including non-human species, without requiring individual body measurements or shape fitting. Operating in real time, WiP achieves low joint position error and demonstrates accurate 3D motion reconstruction for both human and animal subjects in-the-wild.

Yet, extracting automatically objective, interpretable features for a detailed analysis of the patient state remains largely unexplored.\n  Among MDD's symptoms, Psychomotor retardation (PMR) is a core item, yet its clinical assessment remains largely subjective. While 3D motion capture offers an objective alternative, its reliance on specialized hardware often precludes routine clinical use. In this paper, we propose a non-invasive computational framework that transforms monocular RGB video into clinically relevant 3D gait kinematics. Our pipeline uses Gravity-View Coordinates along with a novel trajectory-correction algorithm that leverages the closed-loop topology of our adapted Timed Up and Go (TUG) protocol to mitigate monocular depth errors. This novel pipeline enables the extraction of 297 explicit gait biomechanical biomarkers from a single camera capture.\n  To address the challenges of small clinical datasets, we introduce a stability-based machine learning framework that identifies robust motor signatures while preventing overfitting. Validated on the CALYPSO dataset, our method achieves an 83.3% accuracy in detecting PMR and explains 64% of the variance in overall depression severity (R^2=0.64). Notably, our study reveals a strong link between reduced ankle propulsion and restricted pelvic mobility to the depressive motor phenotype. These results demonstrate that physical movement serves as a robust proxy for the cognitive state, offering a transparent and scalable tool for the objective monitoring of depression in standard clinical environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5355\u76eeRGB\u89c6\u9891\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u76843D\u6b65\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u91cd\u5ea6\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u795e\u8fd0\u52a8\u8fdf\u7f13\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe83.3%", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u91cd\u5ea6\u6291\u90c1\u75c7(MDD)\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7cbe\u795e\u8fd0\u52a8\u8fdf\u7f13(PMR)\u8fd9\u4e00\u6838\u5fc3\u75c7\u72b6\u3002\u867d\u71363D\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5ba2\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u4e1a\u8bbe\u5907\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e38\u89c4\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u666e\u901a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u7684\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51fa\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5355\u76eeRGB\u89c6\u9891\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a3D\u6b65\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u529b\u89c6\u56fe\u5750\u6807\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u8f68\u8ff9\u6821\u6b63\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684Timed Up and Go(TUG)\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u62d3\u6251\u6765\u51cf\u8f7b\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b3) \u4ece\u5355\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u6355\u83b7\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6297\u4e2a\u660e\u786e\u7684\u6b65\u6001\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff1b4) \u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728CALYPSO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a1) \u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u795e\u8fd0\u52a8\u8fdf\u7f13\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523083.3%\uff1b2) \u89e3\u91ca\u603b\u4f53\u6291\u90c1\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea664%\u7684\u65b9\u5dee(R^2=0.64)\uff1b3) \u53d1\u73b0\u8e1d\u5173\u8282\u63a8\u8fdb\u529b\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u9aa8\u76c6\u6d3b\u52a8\u53d7\u9650\u4e0e\u6291\u90c1\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u578b\u6709\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\uff1b4) \u8bc1\u660e\u8eab\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u666e\u901a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u5ba2\u89c2\u76d1\u6d4b\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u5ba2\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u6291\u90c1\u72b6\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u660e\u786e\u8054\u7cfb\u3002"}}

Recent studies formulate SLG within the language modeling framework using autoregressive language models, which suffer from unidirectional context modeling and slow token-by-token inference. To address these limitations, we present MaDiS, a masked-diffusion-based language model for SLG that captures bidirectional dependencies and supports efficient parallel multi-token generation. We further introduce a tri-level cross-modal pretraining scheme that jointly learns from token-, latent-, and 3D physical-space objectives, leading to richer and more grounded sign representations. To accelerate model convergence in the fine-tuning stage, we design a novel unmasking strategy with temporal checkpoints, reducing the combinatorial complexity of unmasking orders by over $10^{41}$ times. In addition, a mixture-of-parts embedding layer is developed to effectively fuse information stored in different part-wise sign tokens through learnable gates and well-optimized codebooks. Extensive experiments on CSL-Daily, Phoenix-2014T, and How2Sign demonstrate that MaDiS achieves superior performance across multiple metrics, including DTW error and two newly introduced metrics, SiBLEU and SiCLIP, while reducing inference latency by nearly 30%.

Traditional 3D pose estimation approaches often ignore the temporal consistency between frames, causing implausible and jittery motion. The emerging field of kinematics-based 3D motion capture addresses these issues by estimating the temporal transitioning between poses instead. A major drawback in current kinematics approaches is their reliance on Euler angles. Despite their simplicity, Euler angles suffer from discontinuity that leads to unstable motion reconstructions, especially in online settings where trajectory refinement is unavailable. Contrarily, quaternions have no discontinuity and can produce continuous transitions between poses. In this paper, we propose QuaMo, a novel Quaternion Motions method using quaternion differential equations (QDE) for human kinematics capture. We utilize the state-space model, an effective system for describing real-time kinematics estimations, with quaternion state and the QDE describing quaternion velocity. The corresponding angular acceleration is computed from a meta-PD controller with a novel acceleration enhancement that adaptively regulates the control signals as the human quickly changes to a new pose. Unlike previous work, our QDE is solved under the quaternion unit-sphere constraint that results in more accurate estimations. Experimental results show that our novel formulation of the QDE with acceleration enhancement accurately estimates 3D human kinematics with no discontinuity and minimal implausibilities. QuaMo outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets, namely Human3.6M, Fit3D, SportsPose and AIST.

Our key contribution is a Region-Specific Latent Axis Discovery method that learns localized muscle relaxation trajectories in StyleGAN2's latent space, enabling precise control over specific facial regions without global side effects. By correlating these localized latent trajectories with injected toxin units, we learn a predictive dose-response model. We rigorously compare two approaches: direct metric regression versus image-based generative simulation on a clinical dataset of N=360 images from 46 patients. On a hold-out test set, our framework demonstrates moderate-to-strong structural correlations for geometric asymmetry metrics, confirming that the generative model correctly captures the direction of morphological changes.

While prior methods like CAVP effectively model semantic and temporal correspondences between modalities using contrastive objectives, their performance remains suboptimal. A key limitation is the insufficient modeling of the dense, multi-scale nature of both video and audio signals, correspondences often span fine- to coarse-grained spatial-temporal structures, which are underutilized in existing frameworks. To this end, we propose GMS-CAVP, a novel framework that combines Multi-Scale Video-Audio Alignment and Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Diffusion-based pretraining objectives to enhance V-A correspondence modeling. First, GMS-CAVP introduces a multi-scale contrastive learning strategy that captures semantic and temporal relations across varying granularities. Second, we go beyond traditional contrastive learning by incorporating a diffusion-based generative objective, enabling modality translation and synthesis between video and audio. This unified discriminative-generative formulation facilitates deeper cross-modal understanding and paves the way for high-fidelity generation.

Model initialization has emerged as a critical factor in mitigating this degradation, yet the role of modern self-supervised learning under full-model DP remains poorly understood. Here, we present a large-scale evaluation of initialization strategies for differentially private medical image analysis, using chest radiograph classification as a representative benchmark with more than 800,000 images. Using state-of-the-art ConvNeXt models trained with DP-SGD across realistic privacy regimes, we compare non-domain-specific supervised ImageNet initialization, non-domain-specific self-supervised DINOv3 initialization, and domain-specific supervised pretraining on MIMIC-CXR, the largest publicly available chest radiograph dataset. Evaluations are conducted across five external datasets spanning diverse institutions and acquisition settings. We show that DINOv3 initialization consistently improves diagnostic utility relative to ImageNet initialization under DP, but remains inferior to domain-specific supervised pretraining, which achieves performance closest to non-private baselines. We further demonstrate that initialization choice strongly influences demographic fairness, cross-dataset generalization, and robustness to data scale and model capacity under privacy constraints.

However, existing object-centric perception paradigms and loosely coupled vision-language pipelines are still difficult to support management-oriented anomaly understanding required in real-world urban governance. To bridge this gap, we introduce GovLA-10K, the first management-oriented multi-modal benchmark for low-altitude intelligence, along with GovLA-Reasoner, a unified vision-language reasoning framework tailored for governance-aware aerial perception. Unlike existing studies that aim to exhaustively annotate all visible objects, GovLA-10K is deliberately designed around functionally salient targets that directly correspond to practical management needs, and further provides actionable management suggestions grounded in these observations. To effectively coordinate the fine-grained visual grounding with high-level contextual language reasoning, GovLA-Reasoner introduces an efficient feature adapter that implicitly coordinates discriminative representation sharing between the visual detector and the large language model (LLM). Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves performance while avoiding the need of fine-tuning for any task-specific individual components.

This paper presents a simple but effective approach called KeepLoRA to effectively balance these objectives. We first analyze the knowledge retention mechanism within the model parameter space and find that general knowledge is mainly encoded in the principal subspace, while task-specific knowledge is encoded in the residual subspace. Motivated by this finding, KeepLoRA learns new tasks by restricting LoRA parameter updates in the residual subspace to prevent interfering with previously learned capabilities. Specifically, we infuse knowledge for a new task by projecting its gradient onto a subspace orthogonal to both the principal subspace of pre-trained model and the dominant directions of previous task features.

In this work, we propose a new perceptual metric composed of two terms. The first term evaluates the dissimilarity between the textures of two images using Earth Mover's Distance. The second term evaluates the chromatic dissimilarity between two images in the Oklab perceptual color space. We evaluated the performance of our metric on a non-traditional dataset, called Berkeley-Adobe Perceptual Patch Similarity, which contains a wide range of complex distortions in shapes and colors.

As a result, they struggle to represent functions that are continuous yet deliberately non-differentiable (i.e., with prescribed $C^0$ sharp features) without relying on ad hoc post-processing. We present SharpNet, a modified MLP architecture capable of encoding functions with user-defined sharp features by enriching the network with an auxiliary feature function, which is defined as the solution to a Poisson equation with jump Neumann boundary conditions. It is evaluated via an efficient local integral that is fully differentiable with respect to the feature locations, enabling our method to jointly optimize both the feature locations and the MLP parameters to recover the target functions/models. The $C^0$-continuity of SharpNet is precisely controllable, ensuring $C^0$-continuity at the feature locations and smoothness elsewhere. We validate SharpNet on 2D problems and 3D CAD model reconstruction, and compare it against several state-of-the-art baselines. In both types of tasks, SharpNet accurately recovers sharp edges and corners while maintaining smooth behavior away from those features, whereas existing methods tend to smooth out gradient discontinuities.

We propose Video-KTR, a modality-aware policy shaping framework that performs selective, token-level RL by combining three attribution signals: (1) visual-aware tokens identified via counterfactual masking to reveal perceptual dependence; (2) temporal-aware tokens detected through frame shuffling to expose temporal sensitivity; and (3) high-entropy tokens signaling predictive uncertainty. By reinforcing only these key tokens, Video-KTR focuses learning on semantically informative, modality-sensitive content while filtering out low-value tokens. Across five challenging benchmarks, Video-KTR achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive results, achieving 42.7\\% on Video-Holmes (surpassing GPT-4o) with consistent gains on both reasoning and general video understanding tasks. Ablation studies verify the complementary roles of the attribution signals and the robustness of targeted token-level updates. Overall, Video-KTR improves accuracy and interpretability, offering a simple, drop-in extension to RL for complex video reasoning.

However, deployment often demands architectures of varying sizes, exposing limitations of conventional pre-training and fine-tuning. To address this, we propose SWEET, a self-supervised framework that performs constraint-based pre-training to enable scalable initialization in vision tasks. Instead of pre-training a fixed-size model, we learn a shared weight template and size-specific weight scalers under Tucker-based factorization, which promotes modularity and supports flexible adaptation to architectures with varying depths and widths. Target models are subsequently initialized by composing and reweighting the template through lightweight weight scalers, whose parameters can be efficiently learned from minimal training data. To further enhance flexibility in width expansion, we introduce width-wise stochastic scaling, which regularizes the template along width-related dimensions and encourages robust, width-invariant representations for improved cross-width generalization.

To address these limitations, we propose DiffStyle3D, a novel diffusion-based paradigm for 3DGS style transfer that directly optimizes in the latent space. Specifically, we introduce an Attention-Aware Loss that performs style transfer by aligning style features in the self-attention space, while preserving original content through content feature alignment. Inspired by the geometric invariance of 3D stylization, we propose a Geometry-Guided Multi-View Consistency method that integrates geometric information into self-attention to enable cross-view correspondence modeling. Based on geometric information, we additionally construct a geometry-aware mask to prevent redundant optimization in overlapping regions across views, which further improves multi-view consistency.

Existing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based methods struggle with slow rendering speeds and suboptimal color restoration, while 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) inherently lacks the capability to model complex volumetric scattering effects. To address these issues, we introduce WaterClear-GS, the first pure 3DGS-based framework that explicitly integrates underwater optical properties of local attenuation and scattering into Gaussian primitives, eliminating the need for an auxiliary medium network. Our method employs a dual-branch optimization strategy to ensure underwater photometric consistency while naturally recovering water-free appearances. This strategy is enhanced by depth-guided geometry regularization and perception-driven image loss, together with exposure constraints, spatially-adaptive regularization, and physically guided spectral regularization, which collectively enforce local 3D coherence and maintain natural visual perception. Experiments on standard benchmarks and our newly collected dataset demonstrate that WaterClear-GS achieves outstanding performance on both novel view synthesis (NVS) and underwater image restoration (UIR) tasks, while maintaining real-time rendering.

Growing demand for rapid iteration, high-fidelity detail, and accessible content creation has further increased interest in this area. Existing methods broadly follow two paradigms - indirect 2D-to-3D reconstruction and direct 3D generation - but both are limited by weak structural modeling and heavy reliance on large-scale ground-truth supervision, often producing structural artifacts, geometric inconsistencies, and degraded high-frequency details in complex scenes. We propose GeoDiff3D, an efficient self-supervised framework that uses coarse geometry as a structural anchor and a geometry-constrained 2D diffusion model to provide texture-rich reference images. Importantly, GeoDiff3D does not require strict multi-view consistency of the diffusion-generated references and remains robust to the resulting noisy, inconsistent guidance. We further introduce voxel-aligned 3D feature aggregation and dual self-supervision to maintain scene coherence and fine details while substantially reducing dependence on labeled data. GeoDiff3D also trains with low computational cost and enables fast, high-quality 3D scene generation.

In this study, we assess the effectiveness of a diffusion-based ear inpainting technique as a pre-processing aid to mitigate the issues of ear accessory occlusions in transformer-based ear recognition systems. Given an input ear image and an automatically derived accessory mask, the inpainting model reconstructs clean and anatomically plausible ear regions by synthesizing missing pixels while preserving local geometric coherence along key ear structures, including the helix, antihelix, concha, and lobule. We evaluate the effectiveness of this pre-processing aid in transformer-based recognition systems for several vision transformer models and different patch sizes for a range of benchmark datasets. Experiments show that diffusion-based inpainting can be a useful pre-processing aid to alleviate ear accessory occlusions to improve overall recognition performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8033\u90e8\u4fee\u590d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u5904\u7406\u8f85\u52a9\uff0c\u53ef\u51cf\u8f7b\u8033\u9970\u906e\u6321\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u8033\u90e8\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "motivation": "\u8033\u9970\uff08\u8033\u73af\u3001\u8033\u673a\u7b49\uff09\u906e\u6321\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u8033\u90e8\u751f\u7269\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u975e\u7ea6\u675f\u6210\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8033\u90e8\u4fee\u590d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u5904\u7406\u8f85\u52a9\u3002\u7ed9\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\u8033\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u906e\u6321\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u5efa\u5e72\u51c0\u4e14\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u5408\u7406\u7684\u8033\u90e8\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u7f3a\u5931\u50cf\u7d20\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5173\u952e\u8033\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u8033\u8f6e\u3001\u5bf9\u8033\u8f6e\u3001\u8033\u7532\u3001\u8033\u5782\uff09\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u8865\u4e01\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u590d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8033\u9970\u906e\u6321\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8033\u90e8\u4fee\u590d\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u7528\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u8f85\u52a9\uff0c\u51cf\u8f7b\u8033\u9970\u906e\u6321\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u8033\u90e8\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We attribute this deficiency to a suboptimal training paradigm inherent in prevailing VLMs, which exhibits a text-dominant optimization bias by conceptualizing visual signals merely as passive conditional inputs rather than supervisory targets. To mitigate this, we introduce Youtu-VL, a framework leveraging the Vision-Language Unified Autoregressive Supervision (VLUAS) paradigm, which fundamentally shifts the optimization objective from ``vision-as-input'' to ``vision-as-target.'' By integrating visual tokens directly into the prediction stream, Youtu-VL applies unified autoregressive supervision to both visual details and linguistic content. Furthermore, we extend this paradigm to encompass vision-centric tasks, enabling a standard VLM to perform vision-centric tasks without task-specific additions.

Inspired by recent advances in Video QA, many existing AVQA approaches primarily focus on visual information processing, leveraging pre-trained models to extract object-level and motion-level representations. However, in those methods, the audio input is primarily treated as complementary to video analysis, and the textual question information contributes minimally to audio--visual understanding, as it is typically integrated only in the final stages of reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Query-guided Spatial--Temporal--Frequency (QSTar) interaction method, which effectively incorporates question-guided clues and exploits the distinctive frequency-domain characteristics of audio signals, alongside spatial and temporal perception, to enhance audio--visual understanding. Furthermore, we introduce a Query Context Reasoning (QCR) block inspired by prompting, which guides the model to focus more precisely on semantically relevant audio and visual features.

Hyperbolic geometry provides a natural framework for representing such structures. Building on this property, this work introduces HexFormer, a hyperbolic vision transformer for image classification that incorporates exponential map aggregation within its attention mechanism. Two designs are explored: a hyperbolic ViT (HexFormer) and a hybrid variant (HexFormer-Hybrid) that combines a hyperbolic encoder with an Euclidean linear classification head. HexFormer incorporates a novel attention mechanism based on exponential map aggregation, which yields more accurate and stable aggregated representations than standard centroid based averaging, showing that simpler approaches retain competitive merit. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements over Euclidean baselines and prior hyperbolic ViTs, with the hybrid variant achieving the strongest overall results. Additionally, this study provides an analysis of gradient stability in hyperbolic transformers. The results reveal that hyperbolic models exhibit more stable gradients and reduced sensitivity to warmup strategies compared to Euclidean architectures, highlighting their robustness and efficiency in training. Overall, these findings indicate that hyperbolic geometry can enhance vision transformer architectures by improving gradient stability and accuracy. In addition, relatively simple mechanisms such as exponential map aggregation can provide strong practical benefits.", "AI": {"tldr": "HexFormer\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u53cc\u66f2\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u805a\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u5148\u524d\u53cc\u66f2ViT\uff0c\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u5e38\u5305\u542b\u5c42\u6b21\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u53cc\u66f2\u51e0\u4f55\u4e3a\u8868\u793a\u6b64\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u53cc\u66f2\u51e0\u4f55\u878d\u5165\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHexFormer\u53cc\u66f2\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u805a\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u8d28\u5fc3\u5e73\u5747\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u63a2\u7d22\u4e24\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u7eaf\u53cc\u66f2ViT\uff08HexFormer\uff09\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u53d8\u4f53\uff08HexFormer-Hybrid\uff09\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u66f2\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5934\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cHexFormer\u76f8\u6bd4\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u5148\u524d\u53cc\u66f2ViT\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u53d8\u4f53\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u5f3a\u6574\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u53cc\u66f2\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u5bf9\u9884\u70ed\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u66f2\u51e0\u4f55\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u5584\u68af\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u673a\u5236\u5982\u6307\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u805a\u5408\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u53cc\u66f2\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u9ad8\u6548\u3002"}}

Vision Transformers (ViTs), in turn, provide global connectivity but lack spatial inductive bias, depend on explicit positional encodings, and remain tied to the initial patch size. Bridging these limitations requires a representation that is both structured and global. We introduce SONIC (Spectral Oriented Neural Invariant Convolutions), a continuous spectral parameterisation that models convolutional operators using a small set of shared, orientation-selective components. These components define smooth responses across the full frequency domain, yielding global receptive fields and filters that adapt naturally across resolutions. Across synthetic benchmarks, large-scale image classification, and 3D medical datasets, SONIC shows improved robustness to geometric transformations, noise, and resolution shifts, and matches or exceeds convolutional, attention-based, and prior spectral architectures with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.

Firstly, we remove high-dimensional 15-degree-of-freedom drift and planar degeneracy from VGGT-SLAM by creating a new factor graph design while still addressing the reconstruction ambiguity of VGGT given unknown camera intrinsics. Secondly, by studying the attention layers of VGGT, we show that one of the layers is well suited to assist in image retrieval verification for free without additional training, which enables both rejecting false positive matches and allows for completing more loop closures. Finally, we conduct a suite of experiments which includes showing VGGT-SLAM 2.0 can easily be adapted for open-set object detection and demonstrating real time performance while running online onboard a ground robot using a Jetson Thor. We also test in environments ranging from cluttered indoor apartments and office scenes to a 4,200 square foot barn, and we also demonstrate VGGT-SLAM 2.0 achieves the highest accuracy on the TUM dataset with about 23 percent less pose error than VGGT-SLAM.

Although multimodal models have advanced across languages, their ability to process Arabic script, especially in artistic and stylized calligraphic forms, remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present DuwatBench, a benchmark of 1,272 curated samples containing about 1,475 unique words across six classical and modern calligraphic styles, each paired with sentence-level detection annotations. The dataset reflects real-world challenges in Arabic writing, such as complex stroke patterns, dense ligatures, and stylistic variations that often challenge standard text recognition systems. Using DuwatBench, we evaluated 13 leading Arabic and multilingual multimodal models and showed that while they perform well on clean text, they struggle with calligraphic variation, artistic distortions, and precise visual-text alignment. By publicly releasing DuwatBench and its annotations, we aim to advance culturally grounded multimodal research, foster fair inclusion of the Arabic language and visual heritage in AI systems, and support continued progress in this area.

However, these agents frequently access interfaces containing sensitive personal information, and screenshots are often transmitted to remote models, creating substantial privacy risks. These risks are particularly severe in GUI workflows: GUIs expose richer, more accessible private information, and privacy risks depend on interaction trajectories across sequential scenes. We propose GUIGuard, a three-stage framework for privacy-preserving GUI agents: (1) privacy recognition, (2) privacy protection, and (3) task execution under protection. We further construct GUIGuard-Bench, a cross-platform benchmark with 630 trajectories and 13,830 screenshots, annotated with region-level privacy grounding and fine-grained labels of risk level, privacy category, and task necessity. Evaluations reveal that existing agents exhibit limited privacy recognition, with state-of-the-art models achieving only 13.3% accuracy on Android and 1.4% on PC. Under privacy protection, task-planning semantics can still be maintained, with closed-source models showing stronger semantic consistency than open-source ones. Case studies on MobileWorld show that carefully designed protection strategies achieve higher task accuracy while preserving privacy. Our results highlight privacy recognition as a critical bottleneck for practical GUI agents.

Despite this, representation learning for depth modality remains underexplored compared to RGB, where large-scale foundation models now define the state of the art. To address this gap, we present DeFM, a self-supervised foundation model trained entirely on depth images for robotic applications. Using a DINO-style self-distillation objective on a curated dataset of 60M depth images, DeFM learns geometric and semantic representations that generalize to diverse environments, tasks, and sensors. To retain metric awareness across multiple scales, we introduce a novel input normalization strategy. We further distill DeFM into compact models suitable for resource-constrained robotic systems. When evaluated on depth-based classification, segmentation, navigation, locomotion, and manipulation benchmarks, DeFM achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong generalization from simulation to real-world environments. We release all our pretrained models, which can be adopted off-the-shelf for depth-based robotic learning without task-specific fine-tuning.

This method bridges progressive training paradigm with the phenomenon of redundant QK (or KV ) activations across deeper layers of transformers. EPAS gradually grows a sharing region during training by switching decoder layers to activation sharing mode. This results in throughput increase due to reduced compute. To utilize deeper layer redundancy, the sharing region starts from the deep end of the model and grows towards the shallow end. The EPAS trained models allow for variable region lengths of activation sharing for different compute budgets during inference. Empirical evaluations with QK activation sharing in LLaMA models ranging from 125M to 7B parameters show up to an 11.1% improvement in training throughput and up to a 29% improvement in inference throughput while maintaining similar loss curve to the baseline models. Furthermore, applying EPAS in continual pretraining to transform TinyLLaMA into an attention-sharing model yields up to a 10% improvement in average accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, emphasizing the significance of progressive training in cross layer activation sharing models.", "AI": {"tldr": "EPAS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5171\u4eab\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528Transformer\u6df1\u5c42\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9010\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u5171\u4eab\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u5229\u7528Transformer\u6df1\u5c42\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5197\u4f59QK/KV\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "EPAS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0eTransformer\u6df1\u5c42\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5197\u4f59\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9010\u6b65\u5c06\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5c42\u5207\u6362\u5230\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5171\u4eab\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5171\u4eab\u533a\u57df\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u6df1\u5c42\u5f00\u59cb\u5411\u6d45\u5c42\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6839\u636e\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u8c03\u6574\u5171\u4eab\u533a\u57df\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728125M\u52307B\u53c2\u6570\u7684LLaMA\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cQK\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5171\u4eab\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad811.1%\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u548c29%\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u635f\u5931\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002\u5728TinyLLaMA\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0cEPAS\u76f8\u6bd4SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u9ad810%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "EPAS\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5171\u4eab\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4e86Transformer\u6df1\u5c42\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u8de8\u5c42\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5171\u4eab\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell. (TPAMI)", "summary": "While many deep learning models trained on private datasets have been deployed in various practical tasks, they may pose a privacy leakage risk as attackers could recover informative data or label knowledge from models. In this work, we present \\emph{privacy-preserving model transcription}, a data-free model-to-model conversion solution to facilitate model deployment with a privacy guarantee. To this end, we propose a cooperative-competitive learning approach termed \\emph{differentially private synthetic distillation} that learns to convert a pretrained model (teacher) into its privacy-preserving counterpart (student) via a trainable generator without access to private data. The learning collaborates with three players in a unified framework and performs alternate optimization: i)~the generator is learned to generate synthetic data, ii)~the teacher and student accept the synthetic data and compute differential private labels by flexible data or label noisy perturbation, and iii)~the student is updated with noisy labels and the generator is updated by taking the student as a discriminator for adversarial training.

We investigated the performance of $k$-means color quantization at four quantization levels in the RGB, CIE-XYZ, and CIE-LUV/CIE-HCL colorspaces, on 148 varied digital images spanning a wide range of scenes, subjects and settings. The Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) measure numerically assessed the quality of the quantized images, and showed that in about half of the cases, $k$-means color quantization is best in the RGB space, while at other times, and especially for higher quantization levels ($k$), the CIE-XYZ colorspace is where it usually does better. There are also some cases, especially at lower $k$, where the best performance is obtained in the CIE-LUV colorspace.

Fundamentally, this constitutes a reasoning process composed of \\textit{hypothesis-verification cycles}, requiring models to possess both geospatial reasoning capabilities and the ability to verify evidence against geographic facts. Existing methods typically internalize location knowledge and reasoning patterns into static memory via supervised training or trajectory-based reinforcement fine-tuning. Consequently, these methods are prone to factual hallucinations and generalization bottlenecks in open-world settings or scenarios requiring dynamic knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Localization Agent, called LocationAgent. Our core philosophy is to retain hierarchical reasoning logic within the model while offloading the verification of geographic evidence to external tools. To implement hierarchical reasoning, we design the RER architecture (Reasoner-Executor-Recorder), which employs role separation and context compression to prevent the drifting problem in multi-step reasoning. For evidence verification, we construct a suite of clue exploration tools that provide diverse evidence to support location reasoning. Furthermore, to address data leakage and the scarcity of Chinese data in existing datasets, we introduce CCL-Bench (China City Location Bench), an image geolocation benchmark encompassing various scene granularities and difficulty levels.

Compositional methods improve interpretability, but most rely on a single agent or hand-crafted pipeline and cannot decide when to collaborate across complementary agents or compete among overlapping ones. We introduce MATA (Multi-Agent hierarchical Trainable Automaton), a multi-agent system presented as a hierarchical finite-state automaton for visual reasoning whose top-level transitions are chosen by a trainable hyper agent. Each agent corresponds to a state in the hyper automaton, and runs a small rule-based sub-automaton for reliable micro-control. All agents read and write a shared memory, yielding transparent execution history. To supervise the hyper agent's transition policy, we build transition-trajectory trees and transform to memory-to-next-state pairs, forming the MATA-SFT-90K dataset for supervised finetuning (SFT).

However, constructing accurate 3D radio maps requires fine-grained 3D geometric information and a profound understanding of electromagnetic wave propagation. Existing approaches typically treat optical and wireless knowledge as distinct modalities, failing to exploit the fundamental physical principles governing both light and electromagnetic propagation. To bridge this gap, we propose URF-GS, a unified radio-optical radiation field representation framework for accurate and generalizable 3D radio map construction based on 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) and inverse rendering. By fusing visual and wireless sensing observations, URF-GS recovers scene geometry and material properties while accurately predicting radio signal behavior at arbitrary transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that URF-GS achieves up to a 24.7% improvement in spatial spectrum prediction accuracy and a 10x increase in sample efficiency for 3D radio map construction compared with neural radiance field (NeRF)-based methods.

Whereas simulations of $T_2$ are easy, $T_2^{\\prime}$ is not easily simulated if only magnetizations of individual isochromats are simulated.\n  Theory and Methods: Efficient methods for simulating $T_2^{\\prime}$ were proposed. To approximate the Lorentzian function of $T_2^{\\prime}$ realistically, conventional simulators require 100+ isochromats. This approximation can be avoided by utilizing a linear phase model for simulating an entire Lorentzian function directly. To represent the linear phase model, the partial derivatives of the magnetizations with respect to the frequency axis were also simulated. To accelerate the simulations with these partial derivatives, the proposed methods introduced two techniques: analytic solutions, and combined transitions. For understanding the fundamental mechanism of the proposed method, a simple one-isochromat simulation was performed. For evaluating realistic cases, several pulse sequences were simulated using two phantoms with and without $T_2^{\\prime}$ simulations.\n  Results: The one-isochromat simulation demonstrated that $T_2^{\\prime}$ simulations were possible. In the realistic cases, $T_2^{\\prime}$ was recovered as expected without using 100+ isochromats for each point. The computational times with $T_2^{\\prime}$ simulations were only 2.0 to 2.7 times longer than those without $T_2^{\\prime}$ simulations. When the above-mentioned two techniques were utilized, the analytic solutions accelerated 19 times, and the combined transitions accelerated up to 17 times.\n  Conclusion: Both theory and results showed that the proposed methods simulated $T_2^{\\prime}$ efficiently by utilizing a linear model with a Lorentzian function, analytic solutions, and combined transitions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684MRI\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u4f4d\u6a21\u578b\u76f4\u63a5\u6a21\u62dfT2'\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981100+\u7b49\u8272\u4f53\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728MRI\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6a2a\u5411\u5f1b\u8c6b\u65f6\u95f4T2*\u7531\u53ef\u9006(T2')\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006(T2)\u5206\u91cf\u7ec4\u6210\u3002T2\u6a21\u62df\u76f8\u5bf9\u5bb9\u6613\uff0c\u4f46T2'\u6a21\u62df\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u6a21\u62df\u5927\u91cf\u7b49\u8272\u4f53\u624d\u80fd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u4f4d\u6a21\u578b\u76f4\u63a5\u6a21\u62df\u6574\u4e2a\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5927\u91cf\u7b49\u8272\u4f53\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u78c1\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9891\u7387\u8f74\u7684\u504f\u5bfc\u6570\u6765\u8868\u793a\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u4f4d\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u52a0\u901f\u6280\u672f\uff1a\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u8dc3\u8fc1\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u7b49\u8272\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u8bc1\u660eT2'\u6a21\u62df\u53ef\u884c\u3002\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u9700100+\u7b49\u8272\u4f53\u5373\u53ef\u6062\u590dT2'\u6548\u679c\u3002\u542bT2'\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4ec5\u4e3a\u65e0T2'\u6a21\u62df\u76842.0-2.7\u500d\u3002\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u52a0\u901f19\u500d\uff0c\u7ec4\u5408\u8dc3\u8fc1\u52a0\u901f\u8fbe17\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u8dc3\u8fc1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u6a21\u62dfT2'\u5f1b\u8c6b\u6548\u5e94\u3002"}}

Intended for submission to ICCV 2027", "summary": "Autonomous drone pursuit requires not only detecting drones but also predicting their trajectories in a manner that enables kinematically feasible interception. Existing tracking methods optimize for prediction accuracy but ignore pursuit feasibility, resulting in trajectories that are physically impossible to intercept 99.9% of the time. We propose Perception-to-Pursuit (P2P), a track-centric temporal reasoning framework that bridges detection and actionable pursuit planning. Our method represents drone motion as compact 8-dimensional tokens capturing velocity, acceleration, scale, and smoothness, enabling a 12-frame causal transformer to reason about future behavior. We introduce the Intercept Success Rate (ISR) metric to measure pursuit feasibility under realistic interceptor constraints. Evaluated on the Anti-UAV-RGBT dataset with 226 real drone sequences, P2P achieves 28.12 pixel average displacement error and 0.597 ISR, representing a 77% improvement in trajectory prediction and 597x improvement in pursuit feasibility over tracking-only baselines, while maintaining perfect drone classification accuracy (100%).

Conventional solutions to obstructions rely on a bulky compound optics array or computational inpainting, which compromise compactness or fidelity. Metalenses composed of subwavelength meta-atoms promise compact imaging, but simultaneous achievement of broadband and obstruction-free imaging remains a challenge, since a metalens that images distant scenes across a broadband spectrum cannot properly defocus near-depth occlusions. Here, we introduce a learned split-spectrum metalens that enables broadband obstruction-free imaging. Our approach divides the spectrum of each RGB channel into pass and stop bands with multi-band spectral filtering and learns the metalens to focus light from far objects through pass bands, while filtering focused near-depth light through stop bands. This optical signal is further enhanced using a neural network. Our learned split-spectrum metalens achieves broadband and obstruction-free imaging with relative PSNR gains of 32.29% and improves object detection and semantic segmentation accuracies with absolute gains of +13.54% mAP, +48.45% IoU, and +20.35% mIoU over a conventional hyperbolic design.

C.-C. Jay Kuo and Jonghye Woo are the senior authors", "summary": "Echocardiography is a cornerstone for managing heart failure (HF), with Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) being a critical metric for guiding therapy. However, manual LVEF assessment suffers from high inter-observer variability, while existing Deep Learning (DL) models are often computationally intensive and data-hungry \"black boxes\" that impede clinical trust and adoption. Here, we propose a backpropagation-free multi-task Green Learning (MTGL) framework that performs simultaneous Left Ventricle (LV) segmentation and LVEF classification. Our framework integrates an unsupervised VoxelHop encoder for hierarchical spatio-temporal feature extraction with a multi-level regression decoder and an XG-Boost classifier. On the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, our MTGL model achieves state-of-the-art classification and segmentation performance, attaining a classification accuracy of 94.3% and a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.912, significantly outperforming several advanced 3D DL models. Crucially, our model achieves this with over an order of magnitude fewer parameters, demonstrating exceptional computational efficiency.

Motivated by the multimodal generative capabilities of recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), this work investigates a fundamental yet underexplored question: can MLLMs generate missing modalities for products in e-commerce scenarios? We propose the Missing Modality Product Completion Benchmark (MMPCBench), which consists of two sub-benchmarks: a Content Quality Completion Benchmark and a Recommendation Benchmark.\n  We further evaluate six state-of-the-art MLLMs from the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma-3 model families across nine real-world e-commerce categories, focusing on image-to-text and text-to-image completion tasks. Experimental results show that while MLLMs can capture high-level semantics, they struggle with fine-grained word-level and pixel- or patch-level alignment. In addition, performance varies substantially across product categories and model scales, and we observe no trivial correlation between model size and performance, in contrast to trends commonly reported in mainstream benchmarks. We also explore Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to better align MLLMs with this task. GRPO improves image-to-text completion but does not yield gains for text-to-image completion. Overall, these findings expose the limitations of current MLLMs in real-world cross-modal generation and represent an early step toward more effective missing-modality product completion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7535\u5546\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8865\u5168\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6587\u672c\u3001\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u5546\u54c1\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6d41\u57fa\u51c6\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u5546\u5e73\u53f0\u5e38\u56e0\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\u6216\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u5143\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u5931\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u7247\u6216\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u4ea7\u54c1\u5c55\u793a\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u5982\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u53d7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22MLLMs\u80fd\u5426\u4e3a\u7535\u5546\u4ea7\u54c1\u751f\u6210\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u8fd9\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u4f46\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u4ea7\u54c1\u8865\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\uff08MMPCBench\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5185\u5bb9\u8d28\u91cf\u8865\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u57fa\u51c6\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b50\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86Qwen2.5-VL\u548cGemma-3\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u516d\u4e2aSOTA MLLMs\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e5d\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u7535\u5546\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u6587\u672c\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u8865\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u8fd8\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528Group Relative Policy Optimization\uff08GRPO\uff09\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5bf9\u9f50MLLMs\u4e0e\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1\uff09MLLMs\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bcd\u7ea7\u548c\u50cf\u7d20/\u5757\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b2\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5546\u54c1\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff1b3\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u65e0\u7b80\u5355\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6d41\u57fa\u51c6\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e0d\u540c\uff1b4\uff09GRPO\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u6587\u672c\u8865\u5168\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u8865\u5168\u65e0\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dMLLMs\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u5546\u54c1\u7c7b\u522b\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0a\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u662f\u8fc8\u5411\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u4ea7\u54c1\u8865\u5168\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u6269\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3002"}}
