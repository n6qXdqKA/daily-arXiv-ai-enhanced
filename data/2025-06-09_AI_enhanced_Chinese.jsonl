First, they do not explicitly model cell-cell interaction as they\nfactorize the joint distribution of whole-slide ST data and predict the gene\nexpression of each spot independently. Second, their encoders struggle with\nmemory constraints due to the large number of spots (often exceeding 10,000) in\ntypical ST datasets.

At the core of a UAV lies the central processing system that\nuses wireless signals to control their movement. The most popular UAVs are\nquadcopters that use a set of four motors, arranged as two on either side with\nopposite spin. An autonomous UAV is called a drone. Drones have been in service\nin the US army since the 90's for covert missions critical to national\nsecurity. It would not be wrong to claim that drones make up an integral part\nof the national security and provide the most valuable service during\nsurveillance operations. While UAVs are controlled using wireless signals,\nthere reside some challenges that disrupt the operation of such vehicles such\nas signal quality and range, real time processing, human expertise, robust\nhardware and data security. These challenges can be solved by programming UAVs\nto be autonomous, using object detection and tracking, through Computer Vision\nalgorithms. Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary field that seeks the use of\ndeep learning to gain a high-level understanding of digital images and videos\nfor the purpose of automating the task of human visual system.

We found that 94 of the 111\nVLMs failed to do better than random guessing, while humans achieved\nnear-ceiling accuracy. VLMs even respond with each choice almost equally\nfrequently. Are they randomly guessing? Although most VLMs struggle, when we\nzoom in on five of the top-tier VLMs with above-chance performance, we find\nthat their performance declined with increasing task difficulty but varied only\nslightly across different prompts and scene objects. These behavioral features\ncannot be explained by considering them as random guessers. Instead, they\nlikely use a combination of heuristics and guessing such that their performance\nis subject to the task difficulty but robust to perceptual variations.

Existing RF-based MPPE methods typically\ninvolve either 1) converting RF signals into heatmap images through complex\npreprocessing, or 2) applying a deep embedding network directly to raw RF\nsignals. The first approach, while delivering decent performance, is\ncomputationally intensive and time-consuming. The second method, though simpler\nin preprocessing, results in lower MPPE accuracy and generalization\nperformance. This paper proposes an efficient and lightweight one-stage MPPE\nmodel based on raw RF signals. By sub-grouping RF signals and embedding them\nusing a shared single-layer CNN followed by multi-head attention, this model\noutperforms previous methods that embed all signals at once through a large and\ndeep CNN. Additionally, we propose a new self-supervised learning (SSL) method\nthat takes inputs from both one unmasked subgroup and the remaining masked\nsubgroups to predict the latent representations of the masked data. Empirical\nresults demonstrate that our model improves MPPE accuracy by up to 15 in\nPCKh@0.5 compared to previous methods using raw RF signals. Especially, the\nproposed SSL method has shown to significantly enhance performance improvements\nwhen placed in new locations or in front of obstacles at RF antennas,\ncontributing to greater performance gains as the number of people increases.\nOur code and dataset is open at Github. https://github.com/sshnan7/SOSPE .", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbRF\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5355\u9636\u6bb5MPPE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7ec4\u548c\u5171\u4eabCNN\u5d4c\u5165\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RF-based MPPE\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u9884\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u7ec4\u5904\u7406\u539f\u59cbRF\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u5355\u5c42CNN\u5d4c\u5165\u540e\u63a5\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u5b50\u7ec4\u9884\u6d4b\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "PCKh@0.5\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u534715%\uff0c\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u6216\u969c\u788d\u7269\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4eba\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u6548\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

Our approach uniquely combines Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Transformer\nblocks and Hierarchical Transformer blocks within a UNet framework. The FFT\nTransformer blocks leverage the global frequency domain information to\neffectively capture and separate reflection patterns, while the Hierarchical\nTransformer blocks utilize multi-scale feature extraction to handle reflections\nof varying sizes and complexities.

However, by building\non recent advances in 3D models such as neural radiance fields, some authors\nhave shown that 3D techniques can at last improve outputs extracted from\nindependent 2D views, by fusing them into 3D and denoising them. This is\nparticularly helpful in egocentric videos, where the camera motion is\nsignificant, but only under the assumption that the scene itself is static. In\nfact, as shown in the recent analysis conducted by EPIC Fields, 3D techniques\nare ineffective when it comes to studying dynamic phenomena, and, in\nparticular, when segmenting moving objects. In this paper, we look into this\nissue in more detail. First, we propose to improve dynamic segmentation in 3D\nby fusing motion segmentation predictions from a 2D-based model into layered\nradiance fields (Layered Motion Fusion). However, the high complexity of long,\ndynamic videos makes it challenging to capture the underlying geometric\nstructure, and, as a result, hinders the fusion of motion cues into the\n(incomplete) scene geometry.

Conditioned on a single image, it simultaneously denoises multiple 3D\nparts, enabling end-to-end part-aware generation of both individual objects and\ncomplex multi-object scenes. PartCrafter builds upon a pretrained 3D mesh\ndiffusion transformer (DiT) trained on whole objects, inheriting the pretrained\nweights, encoder, and decoder, and introduces two key innovations: (1) A\ncompositional latent space, where each 3D part is represented by a set of\ndisentangled latent tokens; (2) A hierarchical attention mechanism that enables\nstructured information flow both within individual parts and across all parts,\nensuring global coherence while preserving part-level detail during generation.\nTo support part-level supervision, we curate a new dataset by mining part-level\nannotations from large-scale 3D object datasets. Experiments show that\nPartCrafter outperforms existing approaches in generating decomposable 3D\nmeshes, including parts that are not directly visible in input images,\ndemonstrating the strength of part-aware generative priors for 3D understanding\nand synthesis.

However, existing methods commonly overlook the key\ndifferences between aerial and close-range settings, such as varying depth\nranges along epipolar lines and insensitive feature-matching associated with\nlow-detailed aerial images. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive\nDepth Range MVS (ADR-MVS), which integrates monocular geometric cues to improve\nmulti-view depth estimation accuracy. The key component of ADR-MVS is the depth\nrange predictor, which generates adaptive range maps from depth and normal\nestimates using cross-attention discrepancy learning. In the first stage, the\nrange map derived from monocular cues breaks through predefined depth\nboundaries, improving feature-matching discriminability and mitigating\nconvergence to local optima. In later stages, the inferred range maps are\nprogressively narrowed, ultimately aligning with the cascaded MVS framework for\nprecise depth regression.

Later, it was\npointed out that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason\nand this is why Rosin - through mathematical analysis - introduced a measure\ncalled merit. However, this measure involves optimal scheme of polygonal\napproximation and so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness\nof an approximation.

Inspired by human vision\nstudies, research has begun exploring whether machines, such as large vision\nlanguage models (LVLMs), exhibit similar susceptibilities to visual illusions.\nHowever, studies often have used non-abstract images and have not distinguished\nactual and apparent features, leading to ambiguous assessments of machine\ncognition. To address these limitations, we introduce a visual question\nanswering (VQA) dataset, categorized into genuine and fake illusions, along\nwith corresponding control images. Genuine illusions present discrepancies\nbetween actual and apparent features, whereas fake illusions have the same\nactual and apparent features even though they look illusory due to the similar\ngeometric configuration. We evaluate the performance of LVLMs for genuine and\nfake illusion VQA tasks and investigate whether the models discern actual and\napparent features. Our findings indicate that although LVLMs may appear to\nrecognize illusions by correctly answering questions about both feature types,\nthey predict the same answers for both Genuine Illusion and Fake Illusion VQA\nquestions. This suggests that their responses might be based on prior knowledge\nof illusions rather than genuine visual understanding.

The Skin Prick Automated Test (SPAT)\ndevice was designed for increased consistency in test results, and captures 32\nimages to be jointly used for allergy wheal detection and delineation, which\nleads to a diagnosis.\n  Materials and Methods: Using SPAT data from $868$ patients with suspected\ninhalant allergies, we designed an automated method to detect and delineate\nwheals on these images. To this end, $10,416$ wheals were manually annotated by\ndrawing detailed polygons along the edges. The unique data-modality of the SPAT\ndevice, with $32$ images taken under distinct lighting conditions, requires a\ncustom-made approach. Our proposed method consists of two parts: a neural\nnetwork component that segments the wheals on the pixel level, followed by an\nalgorithmic and interpretable approach for detecting and delineating the\nwheals.\n  Results: We evaluate the performance of our method on a hold-out validation\nset of $217$ patients.

In recent years, progress has been witnessed with the\nsuccess of utilizing transformer-like models, such as combining the attention\nmechanism with CNN. In particular, transformer-based segmentation models can\nextract global information more effectively, compensating for the drawbacks of\nCNN modules that focus on local features. However, utilizing transformer\narchitecture is not easy, because training transformer-based models can be\nresource-demanding. Moreover, due to the distinct characteristics in the\nmedical field, especially when encountering mid-sized and small organs with\ncompact regions, their results often seem unsatisfactory. For example, using\nViT to segment medical images directly only gives a DSC of less than 50\\%,\nwhich is far lower than the clinically acceptable score of 80\\%. In this paper,\nwe used Mask2Former with deformable attention to reduce computation and\nproposed offset adjustment strategies to encourage sampling points within the\nsame organs during attention weights computation, thereby integrating compact\nforeground information better.

While current video diffusion models produce high-quality\nresults, adapting them for efficient editing remains difficult due to the heavy\ncomputational demands that prevent the direct application of previous image\nediting techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FADE, a\ntraining-free yet highly effective video editing approach that fully leverages\nthe inherent priors from pre-trained video diffusion models via frequency-aware\nfactorization. Rather than simply using these models, we first analyze the\nattention patterns within the video model to reveal how video priors are\ndistributed across different components.

While open-source foundation models\nstruggle with both, we find that fine-tuning them to acquire a dynamics model\nthrough supervision is significantly easier than acquiring a world model. In\nturn, dynamics models can be used to bootstrap world models through two main\nstrategies: 1) weakly supervised learning from synthetic data and 2) inference\ntime verification. Firstly, the dynamics model can annotate actions for\nunlabelled pairs of video frame observations to expand the training data. We\nfurther propose a new objective, where image tokens in observation pairs are\nweighted by their importance, as predicted by a recognition model. Secondly,\nthe dynamics models can assign rewards to multiple samples of the world model\nto score them, effectively guiding search at inference time.

This difficulty stems from\ntheir elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and\nmultifaceted semantic information.\n  To address these challenges, we propose HAVIR that contains two adapters: (1)\nThe AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior,\ncapturing topological structures; (2) The CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to\nCLIP text and image embeddings, containing semantic information. These\ncomplementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the\nfinal reconstructed image. To extract the most essential semantic information\nfrom complex scenarios, the CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions\ndescribing the visual stimuli and their corresponding semantic images\nsynthesized from these captions.

Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source VLMs (e.g.,\nQwen2.5 7B) on our dataset leads to significant performance improvements.\nSpecifically, the Qwen2.5 VL 7B fine-tuned on our wheat instruction dataset\nachieves accuracy scores of 79.2% and 84.6% on wheat stress and growth stage\nconversation tasks respectively, surpassing even general-purpose commercial\nmodels such as GPT-4o by a margin of 11.9% and 34.6%.", "AI": {"tldr": "WisWheat\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u5c0f\u9ea6\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u4e09\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u5f00\u6e90\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c0f\u9ea6\u7ba1\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5c0f\u9ea6\u7ba1\u7406\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u4e13\u5bb6\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709VLMs\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWisWheat\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\uff1a\u57fa\u7840\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3001\u5b9a\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3aVLMs\u5728\u5c0f\u9ea6\u7ba1\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684Qwen2.5 VL 7B\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c0f\u9ea6\u538b\u529b\u548c\u751f\u957f\u9636\u6bb5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523079.2%\u548c84.6%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eGPT-4o\u3002", "conclusion": "WisWheat\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VLMs\u5728\u5c0f\u9ea6\u7ba1\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u519c\u4e1a\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

But these MLLMs are good at analyzing short videos,\nwhile suffering from difficulties in understanding videos with a longer\ncontext. To address this difficulty, several agent paradigms have recently been\nproposed, using MLLMs as agents for retrieving extra contextual knowledge in a\nlong video. However, most existing agents ignore the key fact that a long video\nis composed with multiple shots, i.e., to answer the user question from a long\nvideo, it is critical to deeply understand its relevant shots like human.\nWithout such insight, these agents often mistakenly find redundant even noisy\ntemporal context, restricting their capacity for long video understanding. To\nfill this gap, we propose VideoChat-A1, a novel long video agent paradigm.\nDifferent from the previous works, our VideoChat-A1 can deeply think with long\nvideos, via a distinct chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm. More specifically, it\ncan progressively select the relevant shots of user question, and look into\nthese shots in a coarse-to-fine partition. By multi-modal reasoning along the\nshot chain, VideoChat-A1 can effectively mimic step-by-step human thinking\nprocess, allowing to interactively discover preferable temporal context for\nthoughtful understanding in long videos.

Code and data: https://github.com/meetdavidwan/clamr", "summary": "Online video web content is richly multimodal: a single video blends vision,\nspeech, ambient audio, and on-screen text. Retrieval systems typically treat\nthese modalities as independent retrieval sources, which can lead to noisy and\nsubpar retrieval. We explore multimodal video content retrieval, where\nrelevance can be scored from one particular modality or jointly across multiple\nmodalities simultaneously. Consequently, an effective retriever must\ndynamically choose which modality (or set of modalities) best addresses the\nquery. We introduce CLaMR, a multimodal, late-interaction retriever that\njointly indexes 4 modalities: video frames, transcribed speech, on-screen text,\nand metadata. CLaMR jointly encodes all modalities with a unified multimodal\nbackbone for improved contextualization and is trained to enhance dynamic\nmodality selection via two key innovations. First, given the lack of training\ndata for multimodal retrieval, we introduce MultiVENT 2.0++, a large-scale\nsynthetic training dataset built on MultiVENT 2.0 (event-centric videos in\nvarious languages paired with queries) with modality-targeted queries. Next, we\npropose a modality-aware loss that jointly trains according to a standard\ncontrastive objective alongside an objective for learning correct modality\nusage. On the test sets of MultiVENT 2.0++ and MSRVTT, conventional aggregation\nstrategies, such as averaging similarities for baseline retrievers, degrade\nperformance by introducing noise from irrelevant modalities. In contrast, CLaMR\nconsistently outperforms existing retrievers: on MultiVENT 2.0++, CLaMR\nimproves nDCG@10 by 25.6 over the best single-modality retriever and by 35.4\nover the best multi-modality retriever.

It requires simultaneous capture of both phenological\ndynamics (obtained from multi-temporal satellite data like Sentinel-2) and\nsubtle spectral variations (demanding nanometer-scale spectral resolution from\nhyperspectral imagery). Research combining these two modalities remains scarce\ncurrently due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and crop types\nannotation costs. To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical\nhyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP\nhyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series. With over one million annotated\nfield parcels organized in a four-tier crop taxonomy, H2Crop establishes a\nvital benchmark for fine-grained agricultural crop classification and\nhyperspectral image processing. We propose a dual-stream Transformer\narchitecture that synergistically processes these modalities. It coordinates\ntwo specialized pathways: a spectral-spatial Transformer extracts fine-grained\nsignatures from hyperspectral EnMAP data, while a temporal Swin Transformer\nextracts crop growth patterns from Sentinel-2 time series. The designed\nhierarchy classification heads with hierarchical fusion then simultaneously\ndelivers multi-level classification across all taxonomic tiers. Experiments\ndemonstrate that adding hyperspectral EnMAP data to Sentinel-2 time series\nyields a 4.2% average F1-scores improvement (peaking at 6.3%).

Existing backdoor defense\ntechniques are usually developed for single-modal visual or language models\nunder fully parameter-adjustable settings or rely on supervisory knowledge\nduring training. However, in real-world scenarios, defenders cannot modify\nfrozen visual encoders or core LLM parameters, nor possess prior knowledge of\nunknown trigger patterns or target responses. Motivated by the empirical\nfinding that LVLMs readily overfit to fixed, unknown triggers, which can embed\nmalicious associations during adapter-level tuning, we aim to design a defense\nthat operates without access to core weights or attack priors. To this end, we\nintroduce a lightweight, certified-agnostic defense framework, Robust\nInstruction Tuning, that finetunes only adapter modules and text embedding\nlayers under instruction tuning. Our method integrates two complementary\nregularizations: (1) Input Diversity Regularization, which perturbs trigger\ncomponents across training samples to disrupt consistent spurious cues; and (2)\nAnomalous Activation Regularization, which dynamically sparses adapter weights\nexhibiting abnormally sharp activations linked to backdoor patterns.

A key reason is the lack of a large and uniform dataset for\nteaching robots manipulation skills. Current robot datasets often record robot\naction in different action spaces within a simple scene. This hinders the robot\nto learn a unified and robust action representation for different robots within\ndiverse scenes. Observing how humans understand a manipulation task, we find\nthat understanding how the objects should move in the 3D space is a critical\nclue for guiding actions. This clue is embodiment-agnostic and suitable for\nboth humans and different robots. Motivated by this, we aim to learn a 3D flow\nworld model from both human and robot manipulation data. This model predicts\nthe future movement of the interacting objects in 3D space, guiding action\nplanning for manipulation. Specifically, we synthesize a large-scale 3D optical\nflow dataset, named ManiFlow-110k, through a moving object auto-detect\npipeline. A video diffusion-based world model then learns manipulation physics\nfrom these data, generating 3D optical flow trajectories conditioned on\nlanguage instructions. With the generated 3D object optical flow, we propose a\nflow-guided rendering mechanism, which renders the predicted final state and\nleverages GPT-4o to assess whether the predicted flow aligns with the task\ndescription. This equips the robot with a closed-loop planning ability.\nFinally, we consider the predicted 3D optical flow as constraints for an\noptimization policy to determine a chunk of robot actions for manipulation.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization across diverse robotic\nmanipulation tasks and reliable cross-embodiment adaptation without\nhardware-specific training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u5149\u6d41\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u5bfc\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u786c\u4ef6\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u96be\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u7528\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u8868\u793a\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u89e3\u7269\u4f53\u57283D\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ebf\u7d22\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002", "method": "\u5408\u6210\u5927\u89c4\u6a213D\u5149\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u96c6ManiFlow-110k\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u64cd\u4f5c\u7269\u7406\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u76843D\u5149\u6d41\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\u6e32\u67d3\u673a\u5236\u548cGPT-4o\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u786c\u4ef6\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u786c\u4ef6\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "3D\u5149\u6d41\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

In contrast to conventional reasoning benchmarks\nconsisting of tasks with clear instructions, puzzlehunts require models to\ndiscover the underlying problem structure from multimodal evidence and\niterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery,\nexploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent\nprogress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings\nremains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a\nlarge-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess\nstep-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is\nannotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive\nskill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic\nanalysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy,\nwith the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise\naccuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that\nfine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from\n4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near\nzero. Our error analysis reveals that current models exhibit myopic reasoning,\nare bottlenecked by the limitations of language-based inference, and lack\nsketching capabilities crucial for visual and spatial reasoning.

However, an\ninterpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and\nanalyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding\nspaces. In this work, we propose the \\emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding\nComparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their\ndifferences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel\nmatrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of\nthe difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured\ndifferently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this\nkernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with\nthe sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this\nframework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one\nembedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results\ndemonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on\nlarge-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO.
