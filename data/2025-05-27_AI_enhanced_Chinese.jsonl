However, many of\nthese models perceive objects as indivisible, overlooking the components that\nconstitute them. Understanding these components and their associated\naffordances provides valuable insights into an object's functionality, which is\nfundamental for performing a wide range of tasks. In this work, we introduce a\nnovel real-world benchmark, InstructPart, comprising hand-labeled part\nsegmentation annotations and task-oriented instructions to evaluate the\nperformance of current models in understanding and executing part-level tasks\nwithin everyday contexts. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that\ntask-oriented part segmentation remains a challenging problem, even for\nstate-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In addition to our benchmark,\nwe introduce a simple baseline that achieves a twofold performance improvement\nthrough fine-tuning with our dataset. With our dataset and benchmark, we aim to\nfacilitate research on task-oriented part segmentation and enhance the\napplicability of VLMs across various domains, including robotics, virtual\nreality, information retrieval, and other related fields.

It involves inserting an array of electrodes inside the cochlea to\nelectrically stimulate the auditory nerve and restore hearing sensation. A\ncrucial step in this procedure is mastoidectomy, a surgical intervention that\nremoves part of the mastoid region of the temporal bone, providing a critical\npathway to the cochlea for electrode placement. Accurate prediction of the\nmastoidectomy region from preoperative imaging assists presurgical planning,\nreduces surgical risks, and improves surgical outcomes.

We broadly cover how different deep neural networks, after\nfirst being proposed in machine learning, are applied to analysing crowd\nbehaviours. This includes pure deep neural network models as well as recent\ndevelopment of methodologies combining physics with deep learning. In addition,\nrepresentative studies are discussed and compared in detail. Finally, we\ndiscuss the effectiveness of existing methods and future research directions in\nthis rapidly evolving field. This chapter aims to provide a high-level summary\nof the ongoing deep learning research in crowd behaviour analysis. It intends\nto help new researchers who just entered this field to obtain an overall\nunderstanding of the ongoing research, as well as to provide a retrospective\nanalysis for existing researchers to identify possible future directions", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7ae0\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4eba\u7fa4\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4eba\u7fa4\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e24\u5927\u6838\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7fa4\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u516c\u5171\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u5212\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u7eaf\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u5728\u4eba\u7fa4\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8be6\u7ec6\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4eba\u7fa4\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7ae0\u4e3a\u65b0\u624b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6982\u89c8\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

However, cognitive decline associated with conditions such as mild\ncognitive impairment and dementia can compromise driving safety and often lead\nto premature driving cessation.

Understanding emotional responses during TORs can provide\ninsight into drivers' engagement, stress levels, and readiness to resume\ncontrol, particularly in cognitively vulnerable populations. This study\ninvestigated affective responses, measured via facial expression analysis of\nvalence and arousal, during TORs among cognitively healthy older adults and\nthose with cognitive impairment. Facial affect data were analyzed across\ndifferent road geometries and speeds to evaluate within- and between-group\ndifferences in affective states. Within-group comparisons using the Wilcoxon\nsigned-rank test revealed significant changes in valence and arousal during\nTORs for both groups. Cognitively healthy individuals showed adaptive increases\nin arousal under higher-demand conditions, while those with cognitive\nimpairment exhibited reduced arousal and more positive valence in several\nscenarios. Between-group comparisons using the Mann-Whitney U test indicated\nthat cognitively impaired individuals displayed lower arousal and higher\nvalence than controls across different TOR conditions.

In this work, we propose\nHonestFace, a novel approach designed to restore faces with a strong emphasis\non such honesty, particularly concerning identity consistency and texture\nrealism.

Furthermore, we present a new landmark-based evaluation metric. Based\non affine transformation principles, this metric improves the accuracy compared\nto conventional L2 distance calculations for facial feature alignment.\nLeveraging these contributions within a one-step diffusion model framework,\nHonestFace delivers exceptional restoration results in terms of facial fidelity\nand realism.

Being\nable to monitor zooplankton abundances accurately and understand how\npopulations change in relation to ocean conditions is invaluable to marine\nscience research, with important implications for future marine seafood\nproductivity. While new imaging technologies generate massive amounts of video\ndata of zooplankton, analyzing them using general-purpose computer vision tools\ndeveloped for general objects turns out to be highly challenging due to the\nhigh similarity in appearance between the zooplankton and its background (e.g.,\nmarine snow). In this work, we present the ZooplanktonBench, a benchmark\ndataset containing images and videos of zooplankton associated with rich\ngeospatial metadata (e.g., geographic coordinates, depth, etc.) in various\nwater ecosystems.

Traditional silhouette- and\npose-based methods, though theoretically effective at removing such\ndistractions, often fall short of high accuracy due to their sparse and less\ninformative inputs. Emerging end-to-end methods address this by directly\ndenoising RGB videos using human priors. Building on this trend, we propose\nDenoisingGait, a novel gait denoising method. Inspired by the philosophy that\n\"what I cannot create, I do not understand\", we turn to generative diffusion\nmodels, uncovering how they partially filter out irrelevant factors for gait\nunderstanding. Additionally, we introduce a geometry-driven Feature Matching\nmodule, which, combined with background removal via human silhouettes,\ncondenses the multi-channel diffusion features at each foreground pixel into a\ntwo-channel direction vector. Specifically, the proposed within- and\ncross-frame matching respectively capture the local vectorized structures of\ngait appearance and motion, producing a novel flow-like gait representation\ntermed Gait Feature Field, which further reduces residual noise in diffusion\nfeatures.

However, geo-localization\npresents unique challenges, requiring the extraction of multigranular visual\ncues from images and their integration with external world knowledge for\nsystematic reasoning. Current approaches to geo-localization tasks often lack\nrobust reasoning mechanisms and explainability, limiting their effectiveness.\nTo address these limitations, we propose the Geo Reason Enhancement (GRE)\nSuite, a novel framework that augments VLMs with structured reasoning chains\nfor accurate and interpretable location inference. The GRE Suite is\nsystematically developed across three key dimensions: dataset, model, and\nbenchmark. First, we introduce GRE30K, a high-quality geo-localization\nreasoning dataset designed to facilitate fine-grained visual and contextual\nanalysis. Next, we present the GRE model, which employs a multi-stage reasoning\nstrategy to progressively infer scene attributes, local details, and semantic\nfeatures, thereby narrowing down potential geographic regions with enhanced\nprecision.

Similarly, medical images in universal lesion\ndetection (ULD) exhibit substantial variations in image quality, encompassing\nattributes such as clarity and label correctness. How to effectively leverage\ntraining images with diverse qualities becomes a problem in learning deep\nmodels. Conventional training mechanisms, such as self-paced curriculum\nlearning (SCL) and online hard example mining (OHEM), relieve this problem by\nreweighting images with high loss values. Despite their success, these methods\nstill confront two challenges: (i) the loss-based measure of sample hardness is\nimprecise, preventing optimum handling of different cases, and (ii) there\nexists under-utilization in SCL or over-utilization OHEM with the identified\nhard samples. To address these issues, this paper revisits the minibatch\nsampling (MBS), a technique widely used in deep network training but largely\nunexplored concerning the handling of diverse-quality training samples.

Several recent studies strive to\nmitigate this issue by either conducting token compression to prune redundant\nvisual tokens or guiding them to bypass certain computational stages. While\nmost existing work exploits token importance as the redundancy indicator, our\nstudy reveals that two largely neglected factors, namely, the diversity of\nretained visual tokens and their task relevance, often offer more robust\ncriteria in token pruning. To this end, we design ToDRE, a two-stage and\ntraining-free token compression framework that achieves superior performance by\npruning Tokens based on token Diversity and token-task RElevance. Instead of\npruning redundant tokens, ToDRE introduces a greedy k-center algorithm to\nselect and retain a small subset of diverse visual tokens after the vision\nencoder. Additionally, ToDRE addresses the \"information migration\" by further\neliminating task-irrelevant visual tokens within the decoder of large language\nmodel (LLM).

Inspired by the success of large\npre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), prompt tuning has emerged as an\neffective generalization strategy. However, it often struggles to capture\ndomain-specific features due to its reliance on manually or fixed prompt\ninputs. Recently, some prompt generation methods have addressed this limitation\nby dynamically generating instance-specific and domain-specific prompts for\neach input, enriching domain information and demonstrating potential for\nenhanced generalization. Through further investigation, we identify a notable\nissue in existing prompt generation methods: the same input often yields\nsignificantly different and suboptimal prompts across different random seeds, a\nphenomenon we term Prompt Variability. To address this, we introduce negative\nlearning into the prompt generation process and propose Dual-Path Stable Soft\nPrompt Generation (DPSPG), a transformer-based framework designed to improve\nboth the stability and generalization of prompts.

However, challenges associated with\ntraining AI-based weed identification models, such as limited expert-verified\ndata and complexity and variability in morphological features, have hindered\nprogress. To address these issues, we present WeedNet, the first global-scale\nweed identification model capable of recognizing an extensive set of weed\nspecies, including noxious and invasive plant species. WeedNet is an end-to-end\nreal-time weed identification pipeline and uses self-supervised learning,\nfine-tuning, and enhanced trustworthiness strategies. WeedNet achieved 91.02%\naccuracy across 1,593 weed species, with 41% species achieving 100% accuracy.\nUsing a fine-tuning strategy and a Global-to-Local approach, the local Iowa\nWeedNet model achieved an overall accuracy of 97.38% for 85 Iowa weeds, most\nclasses exceeded a 90% mean accuracy per class. Testing across intra-species\ndissimilarity (developmental stages) and inter-species similarity (look-alike\nspecies) suggests that diversity in the images collected, spanning all the\ngrowth stages and distinguishable plant characteristics, is crucial in driving\nmodel performance.

In this study, we proposed a novel CLIP-DINO Prompt-Driven\nSegmentation Network (CDPDNet), which combined a self-supervised vision\ntransformer with CLIP-based text embedding and introduced task-specific text\nprompts to tackle these challenges. Specifically, the framework was constructed\nupon a convolutional neural network (CNN) and incorporated DINOv2 to extract\nboth fine-grained and global visual features, which were then fused using a\nmulti-head cross-attention module to overcome the limited long-range modeling\ncapability of CNNs. In addition, CLIP-derived text embeddings were projected\ninto the visual space to help model complex relationships among organs and\ntumors. To further address the partial label challenge and enhance inter-task\ndiscriminative capability, a Text-based Task Prompt Generation (TTPG) module\nthat generated task-specific prompts was designed to guide the segmentation.\nExtensive experiments on multiple medical imaging datasets demonstrated that\nCDPDNet consistently outperformed existing state-of-the-art segmentation\nmethods.

In parallel, dual-path\nencoders refine the representations by processing cross-modal information\nseparately before an additional cross-attention layer further aligns\nmodalities. The refined features are then aggregated via an expert fusion\nmodule that combines learned gating and self-attention to produce a robust,\nunified representation.

For binary classification (Monkeypox vs. non-Monkeypox),\nthe Vision Transformer, MobileViT, Transformer-in-Transformer, and VGG16\nachieved the highest performance, each with an accuracy and F1-score of 97.8%.\nFor multiclass classification, which contains images of patients with Monkeypox\nand five other classes (chickenpox, measles, hand-foot-mouth disease, cowpox,\nand healthy), ResNetViT and ViT Hybrid models achieved 92% accuracy, with F1\nscores of 92.24% and 92.19%, respectively. The best-performing and most\nlightweight model, MobileViT, was deployed within the mobile application. The\nsecond component is a cross-platform smartphone application that enables users\nto detect Monkeypox through image analysis, track symptoms, and receive\nrecommendations for nearby healthcare centers based on their location. The\nthird component is a real-time monitoring dashboard designed for health\nauthorities to support them in tracking cases, analyzing symptom trends,\nguiding public health interventions, and taking proactive measures.\n  This system is fundamental in developing responsive healthcare infrastructure\nwithin smart cities.

This mechanism also ensures that the stylized results align\nclosely with the distribution of the reference style images.

However, generating high-quality samples typically requires many\niterative decoding steps, resulting in high inference costs. A straightforward\nway to speed up generation is by decoding more tokens in each step, thereby\nreducing the total number of steps. However, when many tokens are decoded\nsimultaneously, the model can only estimate the univariate marginal\ndistributions independently, failing to capture the dependency among them.

In this work, we introduce ReCAP (Reused Context-Aware Prediction), a\nplug-and-play module that accelerates inference in MGMs by constructing\nlow-cost steps via reusing feature embeddings from previously decoded context\ntokens.

We further propose a learnable\nFrequency Composition Transform (FCT) module to adaptively fuse the\nfrequency-specific outputs, enabling consistent and high-fidelity\nreconstruction. To better aggregate the spatial dependencies and the\ninter-channel complementary information, we introduce a Spatial-Aware Channel\nAttention (SA-CA) module that refines moir\\'e-sensitive regions without\nincurring high computational cost. Extensive experiments on various\ndemoir\\'eing benchmarks demonstrate that Freqformer achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance with a compact model size.

In this work, we construct\nPAPI, the largest dataset for studying private attribute profiling in personal\nimages, comprising 2,510 images from 251 individuals with 3,012 annotated\nprivacy attributes. We also propose HolmesEye, a hybrid agentic framework that\ncombines VLMs and LLMs to enhance privacy inference.

To be effective,\nfully supervised segmentation approaches require large amounts of manually\nannotated training data. However, the pixel-level annotation process is\nexpensive, time-consuming, and error-prone, hindering progress and making it\nchallenging to perform effective segmentations. Therefore, models must learn\nefficiently from limited labeled data. Self-supervised learning (SSL),\nparticularly contrastive learning via pre-training on unlabeled data and\nfine-tuning on limited annotations, can facilitate such limited labeled image\nsegmentation. To this end, we propose a novel self-supervised contrastive\nlearning framework for medical image segmentation, leveraging inherent\nrelationships of different images, dubbed PolyCL. Without requiring any\npixel-level annotations or unreasonable data augmentations, our PolyCL learns\nand transfers context-aware discriminant features useful for segmentation from\nan innovative surrogate, in a task-related manner.

Code and models:\n  https://github.com/Huster-Hq/ADD", "summary": "White Light Imaging (WLI) and Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) are the two main\ncolonoscopic modalities for polyp classification. While NBI, as optical\nchromoendoscopy, offers valuable vascular details, WLI remains the most common\nand often the only available modality in resource-limited settings. However,\nWLI-based methods typically underperform, limiting their clinical\napplicability. Existing approaches transfer knowledge from NBI to WLI through\nglobal feature alignment but often rely on cropped lesion regions, which are\nsusceptible to detection errors and neglect contextual and subtle diagnostic\ncues. To address this, this paper proposes a novel holistic classification\nframework that leverages full-image diagnosis without requiring polyp\nlocalization. The key innovation lies in the Alignment-free Dense Distillation\n(ADD) module, which enables fine-grained cross-domain knowledge distillation\nregardless of misalignment between WLI and NBI images. Without resorting to\nexplicit image alignment, ADD learns pixel-wise cross-domain affinities to\nestablish correspondences between feature maps, guiding the distillation along\nthe most relevant pixel connections. To further enhance distillation\nreliability, ADD incorporates Class Activation Mapping (CAM) to filter\ncross-domain affinities, ensuring the distillation path connects only those\nsemantically consistent regions with equal contributions to polyp diagnosis.\nExtensive results on public and in-house datasets show that our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, relatively outperforming the other approaches by\nat least 2.5% and 16.2% in AUC, respectively.

This targeted\ninterference directly disrupts the structural generation capability of\ndiffusion models, effectively preventing them from producing coherent images.\nWe validate our motivation through visualization techniques and extensive\nexperiments on public datasets, demonstrating that SDA achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) protection performance while maintaining strong\nrobustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSDA\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e72\u6270\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u654f\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\u88ab\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5982\u6076\u610f\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5168\u5c40\u6270\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a9\u7801\u5f15\u5bfc\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "SDA\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u5e72\u6270\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u8f6e\u5ed3\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u963b\u6b62\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSDA\u5728\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SDA\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u654f\u611f\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Most previous works choose to enhance/adjust the features/output of a\nspecific modality (i.e., visual or textual) to alleviate hallucinations in\nLVLM, which do not explicitly or systematically enhance the visual reliance. In\nthis paper, we comprehensively investigate the factors which may degenerate the\nvisual reliance in text generation of LVLM from a Bayesian perspective.

We\npropose a simple yet effective way to rectify the prior from a Bayesian\nperspective. Thirdly, we observe that starting from certain steps, the\nposterior of next-token prediction conditioned on visual tokens may collapse to\na prior distribution which does not depend on any informative visual tokens at\nall.

Existing\npruning methods typically rely on single-layer attention scores to rank and\nprune redundant visual tokens to solve this inefficiency. However, as the\ninteraction between tokens and layers is complicated, this raises a basic\nquestion: Is such a simple single-layer criterion sufficient to identify\nredundancy? To answer this question, we rethink the emergence of redundant\nvisual tokens from a fundamental perspective: information flow, which models\nthe interaction between tokens and layers by capturing how information moves\nbetween tokens across layers. We find (1) the CLS token acts as an information\nrelay, which can simplify the complicated flow analysis; (2) the redundancy\nemerges progressively and dynamically via layer-wise attention concentration;\nand (3) relying solely on attention scores from single layers can lead to\ncontradictory redundancy identification. Based on this, we propose FlowCut, an\ninformation-flow-aware pruning framework, mitigating the insufficiency of the\ncurrent criterion for identifying redundant tokens and better aligning with the\nmodel's inherent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that FlowCut achieves\nsuperior results, outperforming SoTA by 1.6% on LLaVA-1.5-7B with 88.9% token\nreduction, and by 4.3% on LLaVA-NeXT-7B with 94.4% reduction, delivering 3.2x\nspeed-up in the prefilling stage.

However, existing paradigms typically\nperform class-agnostic region segmentation followed by category matching, which\ndeviates from the human visual system's process of recognizing objects based on\nsemantic concepts, leading to poor alignment between region segmentation and\ntarget concepts. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Cognition-Inspired\nFramework for open vocabulary image segmentation that emulates the human visual\nrecognition process: first forming a conceptual understanding of an object,\nthen perceiving its spatial extent. The framework consists of three core\ncomponents: (1) A Generative Vision-Language Model (G-VLM) that mimics human\ncognition by generating object concepts to provide semantic guidance for region\nsegmentation. (2) A Concept-Aware Visual Enhancer Module that fuses textual\nconcept features with global visual representations, enabling adaptive visual\nperception based on target concepts. (3) A Cognition-Inspired Decoder that\nintegrates local instance features with G-VLM-provided semantic cues, allowing\nselective classification over a subset of relevant categories. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant improvements,\nreaching $27.2$ PQ, $17.0$ mAP, and $35.3$ mIoU on A-150.

However, naively increasing kernel size often leads to\noptimization instability and degradation in performance. Motivated by the\nspatial bias observed in effective receptive fields (ERFs), we hypothesize that\ndifferent kernel elements converge at variable rates during training. To\nsupport this, we derive a theoretical connection between element-wise gradients\nand first-order optimization, showing that structurally re-parameterized\nconvolution blocks inherently induce spatially varying learning rates. Building\non this insight, we introduce Rep3D, a 3D convolutional framework that\nincorporates a learnable spatial prior into large kernel training. A\nlightweight two-stage modulation network generates a receptive-biased scaling\nmask, adaptively re-weighting kernel updates and enabling local-to-global\nconvergence behavior. Rep3D adopts a plain encoder design with large depthwise\nconvolutions, avoiding the architectural complexity of multi-branch\ncompositions.

Inspired by the Eliciting Latent Knowledge (ELK)\nframework, we posit that VLMs encode safety-relevant information within their\ninternal fusion-layer representations, revealing an implicit safety decision\nboundary in the latent space. This motivates exploiting boundary to steer model\nbehavior. Accordingly, we propose JailBound, a novel latent space jailbreak\nframework comprising two stages: (1) Safety Boundary Probing, which addresses\nthe guidance issue by approximating decision boundary within fusion layer's\nlatent space, thereby identifying optimal perturbation directions towards the\ntarget region; and (2) Safety Boundary Crossing, which overcomes the\nlimitations of decoupled approaches by jointly optimizing adversarial\nperturbations across both image and text inputs. This latter stage employs an\ninnovative mechanism to steer the model's internal state towards\npolicy-violating outputs while maintaining cross-modal semantic consistency.\nExtensive experiments on six diverse VLMs demonstrate JailBound's efficacy,\nachieves 94.32% white-box and 67.28% black-box attack success averagely, which\nare 6.17% and 21.13% higher than SOTA methods, respectively.

To analyze this hidden human-model visual\nthinking discrepancy, we build a visual system that mimicks human visual\ncamouflaged perception to progressively and iteratively `refocus' visual\nconcealed content.

Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we have\nproved that simply replacing all the convolution layers with rotation\nequivariant convolution layers would modify the network into its rotation\nequivariant version.

Methods: Ophthalmic image posts\nand associated captions published between January 1, 2016, and December 31,\n2024, were collected from WeChat Official Accounts. Based on these captions,\nbilingual question-answer (QA) pairs in Chinese and English were generated\nusing GPT-4o-mini. QA pairs were categorized into six subsets by question type\nand language: binary (Binary_CN, Binary_EN), single-choice (Single-choice_CN,\nSingle-choice_EN), and open-ended (Open-ended_CN, Open-ended_EN). The benchmark\nwas used to evaluate the performance of three VLMs: GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash,\nand Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct. Results: The final OphthalWeChat dataset included\n3,469 images and 30,120 QA pairs across 9 ophthalmic subspecialties, 548\nconditions, 29 imaging modalities, and 68 modality combinations. Gemini 2.0\nFlash achieved the highest overall accuracy (0.548), outperforming GPT-4o\n(0.522, P < 0.001) and Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct (0.514, P < 0.001).

To address this, we present a generalizable camera simulation\nframework DriveCamSim, whose core innovation lies in the proposed Explicit\nCamera Modeling (ECM) mechanism. Instead of implicit interaction through\nvanilla attention, ECM establishes explicit pixel-wise correspondences across\nmulti-view and multi-frame dimensions, decoupling the model from overfitting to\nthe specific camera configurations (intrinsic/extrinsic parameters, number of\nviews) and temporal sampling rates presented in the training data.

Most existing solutions rely on\nsynthetic data as supervised setups, limiting their ability to generalize to\nreal-world scenes.

To address this, we propose SAIL, an approach designed to\nestimate albedo-like representations from single-view real-world images. We\nrepurpose the prior knowledge of a latent diffusion model for unconditioned\nscene relighting as a surrogate objective for albedo estimation.

Furthermore, we propose an improved reinforcement\nlearning algorithm AVA-GRPO, which explicitly incentivizes the anomaly\nreasoning capability of MLLMs through a self-verification mechanism with\nlimited annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that Vad-R1 achieves\nsuperior performance, outperforming both open-source and proprietary models on\nVAD and VAR tasks.

A central component of UltraVSR is the Degradation-aware\nRestoration Schedule (DRS), which estimates a degradation factor from the\nlow-resolution input and transforms iterative denoising process into a\nsingle-step reconstruction from from low-resolution to high-resolution videos.\nThis design eliminates randomness from diffusion noise and significantly speeds\nup inference.

By partially shifting feature components along\nthe temporal dimension, these two units collaboratively facilitate effective\nfeature propagation, fusion, and alignment across neighboring frames, without\nrelying on explicit temporal layers.

Moreover, existing methods do\nnot study positional encodings, thereby overlooking the multi-scale spatial\nreasoning needed to capture fine-grained visuotactile correlations. We\nintroduce ViTaPEs, a transformer-based framework that robustly integrates\nvisual and tactile input data to learn task-agnostic representations for\nvisuotactile perception.

Most gesture recognition efforts focus on close-set scenarios, thereby\nlimiting the capacity to effectively handle unseen or novel gestures. We aim to\naddress class-incremental gesture recognition, which entails the ability to\naccommodate new and previously unseen gestures over time. Specifically, we\nintroduce a Prototype-Guided Pseudo Feature Replay (PGPFR) framework for\ndata-free class-incremental gesture recognition. This framework comprises four\ncomponents: Pseudo Feature Generation with Batch Prototypes (PFGBP),\nVariational Prototype Replay (VPR) for old classes, Truncated Cross-Entropy\n(TCE) for new classes, and Continual Classifier Re-Training (CCRT). To tackle\nthe issue of catastrophic forgetting, the PFGBP dynamically generates a\ndiversity of pseudo features in an online manner, leveraging class prototypes\nof old classes along with batch class prototypes of new classes. Furthermore,\nthe VPR enforces consistency between the classifier's weights and the\nprototypes of old classes, leveraging class prototypes and covariance matrices\nto enhance robustness and generalization capabilities. The TCE mitigates the\nimpact of domain differences of the classifier caused by pseudo features.\nFinally, the CCRT training strategy is designed to prevent overfitting to new\nclasses and ensure the stability of features extracted from old classes.\nExtensive experiments conducted on two widely used gesture recognition\ndatasets, namely SHREC 2017 3D and EgoGesture 3D, demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by 11.8\\% and 12.8\\% in terms of\nmean global accuracy, respectively.

We introduce a new paradigm that\nenables VLMs to generate, understand, and edit complex 3D environments by\ninjecting a continually evolving spatial context.

Building on\nthis foundation, we develop an agentic 3D scene generation pipeline in which\nthe VLM iteratively reads from and updates the spatial context.

To ensure the data\nquality, we employ a multi-stage pipeline that integrates a cutting-edge\nvision-language model, a detection model, a segmentation model, alongside\ntask-specific in-painting procedures and strict post-processing. ImgEdit\nsurpasses existing datasets in both task novelty and data quality. Using\nImgEdit, we train ImgEdit-E1, an editing model using Vision Language Model to\nprocess the reference image and editing prompt, which outperforms existing\nopen-source models on multiple tasks, highlighting the value of ImgEdit and\nmodel design. For comprehensive evaluation, we introduce ImgEdit-Bench, a\nbenchmark designed to evaluate image editing performance in terms of\ninstruction adherence, editing quality, and detail preservation. It includes a\nbasic testsuite, a challenging single-turn suite, and a dedicated multi-turn\nsuite. We evaluate both open-source and proprietary models, as well as\nImgEdit-E1, providing deep analysis and actionable insights into the current\nbehavior of image-editing models.

The current de-facto standard of next token prediction\ncommonly operates over a single-scale sequence of dense image tokens, and is\nincapable of utilizing global context especially for early tokens prediction.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new autoregressive design to model a hierarchy\nfrom a few low-resolution image tokens to the typical dense image tokens, and\ndelve into a thorough hierarchical dependency across multi-scale image tokens.\nTechnically, we present a Hierarchical Masked Autoregressive models (Hi-MAR)\nthat pivot on low-resolution image tokens to trigger hierarchical\nautoregressive modeling in a multi-phase manner. Hi-MAR learns to predict a few\nimage tokens in low resolution, functioning as intermediary pivots to reflect\nglobal structure, in the first phase. Such pivots act as the additional\nguidance to strengthen the next autoregressive modeling phase by shaping global\nstructural awareness of typical dense image tokens.

Building on this, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16\nrepresentative S2V models, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses across\ndifferent content.

This paper explores how\nto effectively address this issue. Our key motivation is that as more tokens\nare generated during the autoregressive process, subsequent tokens follow more\nconstrained distributions and are easier to sample. To intuitively explain, if\na model has generated part of a dog, the remaining tokens must complete the dog\nand thus are more constrained. Empirical evidence supports our motivation: at\nlater generation stages, the next tokens can be well predicted by a multilayer\nperceptron, exhibit low variance, and follow closer-to-straight-line denoising\npaths from noise to tokens. Based on our finding, we introduce diffusion step\nannealing (DiSA), a training-free method which gradually uses fewer diffusion\nsteps as more tokens are generated, e.g., using 50 steps at the beginning and\ngradually decreasing to 5 steps at later stages. Because DiSA is derived from\nour finding specific to diffusion in autoregressive models, it is complementary\nto existing acceleration methods designed for diffusion alone. DiSA can be\nimplemented in only a few lines of code on existing models, and albeit simple,\nachieves $5-10\\times$ faster inference for MAR and Harmon and $1.4-2.5\\times$\nfor FlowAR and xAR, while maintaining the generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDiSA\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b65\u51cf\u5c11\u6269\u6563\u6b65\u6570\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u591a\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u540e\u7eed\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u53d7\u9650\u4e14\u66f4\u6613\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u6269\u6563\u6b65\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6269\u6563\u6b65\u9000\u706b\uff08DiSA\uff09\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u51cf\u5c11\u6269\u6563\u6b65\u6570\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u4ece50\u6b65\u964d\u81f35\u6b65\u3002", "result": "DiSA\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff08MAR\u548cHarmon\u63d0\u53475-10\u500d\uff0cFlowAR\u548cxAR\u63d0\u53471.4-2.5\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "DiSA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e92\u8865\u3002"}}

The inherent ill-posedness of this problem is addressed by\nleveraging the expressive power of denoising diffusion probabilistic models to\nrepresent the probabilistic distribution of the underlying anatomy and the\nflexibility of physics-informed neural networks to estimate\nbiologically-plausible motion. A set of tagged MR images of a gel phantom was\nacquired with various tag periods and imaging flip angles to demonstrate the\nimpact of brightness variations and to validate our method. The results show\nthat BRITE achieves more accurate motion and strain estimates as compared to\nother state of the art methods, while also being resistant to tag fading.", "AI": {"tldr": "BRITE\u6280\u672f\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6807\u8bb0\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6807\u8bb0MRI\u4e2d\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u8bb0MRI\u4e2d\u7684\u4eae\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u6269\u6563\u4f7f\u4f20\u7edf\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "BRITE\u6280\u672f\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6807\u8bb0\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "result": "BRITE\u5728\u51dd\u80f6\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e94\u53d8\u4f30\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6807\u8bb0\u892a\u8272\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "BRITE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6807\u8bb0MRI\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

However, this approach is inherently\nrestrictive in practice, where alignment must balance multiple, often\nconflicting objectives. Moreover, user preferences vary across prompts,\nindividuals, and deployment contexts, with varying tolerances for deviation\nfrom a pre-trained base model. We address the problem of inference-time\nmulti-preference alignment: given a set of basis reward functions and a\nreference KL regularization strength, can we design a fine-tuning procedure so\nthat, at inference time, it can generate images aligned with any user-specified\nlinear combination of rewards and regularization, without requiring additional\nfine-tuning?

Three\nvariants are explored: an adaptive threshold-based method, a multi-kernel\nmin-plus method, and a max-plus method emphasizing structural continuity. The\nframework integrates multi-scale processing, Hessian filtering, and wavelet\nshrinkage to enhance edge transitions while maintaining computational\nefficiency. Experiments on MATLAB built-in grayscale and color images suggest\nthat tropical formulations integrated with classical operators, such as Canny\nand LoG, can improve boundary detection in low-contrast and textured regions.\nQuantitative evaluation using standard edge metrics indicates favorable edge\nclarity and structural coherence.

Moreover, we rethink the effectiveness of VLM driving\ndecision and improve the trajectory generation guidance through deep\ninteraction across agent, map instances and VLM output.

The broadcast\nnature of wireless signals makes them susceptible not only to Gaussian noise,\nbut also to unaware interference. This raises the question of whether DMs can\neffectively mitigate interference in wireless semantic communication systems.\nIn this paper, we model the interference cancellation problem as a maximum a\nposteriori (MAP) problem over the joint posterior probability of the signal and\ninterference, and theoretically prove that the solution provides excellent\nestimates for the signal and interference. To solve this problem, we develop an\ninterference cancellation diffusion model (ICDM), which decomposes the joint\nposterior into independent prior probabilities of the signal and interference,\nalong with the channel transition probablity. The log-gradients of these\ndistributions at each time step are learned separately by DMs and accurately\nestimated through deriving. ICDM further integrates these gradients with\nadvanced numerical iteration method, achieving accurate and rapid interference\ncancellation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICDM significantly reduces\nthe mean square error (MSE) and enhances perceptual quality compared to schemes\nwithout ICDM. For example, on the CelebA dataset under the Rayleigh fading\nchannel with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $20$ dB and signal to\ninterference plus noise ratio (SINR) of 0 dB, ICDM reduces the MSE by 4.54 dB\nand improves the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) by 2.47 dB.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08DMs\uff09\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e72\u6270\u6d88\u9664\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08ICDM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u8054\u5408\u540e\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4fe1\u53f7\u6062\u590d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5e7f\u64ad\u7279\u6027\u4f7f\u5176\u6613\u53d7\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6d88\u9664\u65e0\u7ebf\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5e72\u6270\u6d88\u9664\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u8054\u5408\u540e\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\u7684\u6700\u5927\u540e\u9a8c\uff08MAP\uff09\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faICDM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u8054\u5408\u540e\u9a8c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u5148\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u5176\u5bf9\u6570\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cICDM\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff08MSE\uff09\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5728CelebA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMSE\u964d\u4f4e\u4e864.54 dB\uff0cLPIPS\u63d0\u5347\u4e862.47 dB\u3002", "conclusion": "ICDM\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u6d88\u9664\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose a novel reinforcement learning\n(RL) finetuning framework tailored for few-step T2MV diffusion models to\njointly optimize per-view fidelity and cross-view consistency. Specifically, we\nfirst reformulate T2MV denoising across all views as a single unified Markov\ndecision process, enabling multiview-aware policy optimization driven by a\njoint-view reward objective. Next, we introduce ZMV-Sampling, a test-time T2MV\nsampling technique that adds an inversion-denoising pass to reinforce both\nviewpoint and text conditioning, resulting in improved T2MV generation at the\ncost of inference time. To internalize its performance gains into the base\nsampling policy, we develop MV-ZigAL, a novel policy optimization strategy that\nuses reward advantages of ZMV-Sampling over standard sampling as learning\nsignals for policy updates. Finally, noting that the joint-view reward\nobjective under-optimizes per-view fidelity but naively optimizing single-view\nmetrics neglects cross-view alignment, we reframe RL finetuning for T2MV\ndiffusion models as a constrained optimization problem that maximizes per-view\nfidelity subject to an explicit joint-view constraint, thereby enabling more\nefficient and balanced policy updates.

Previous methods\ntypically rely on publicly available real datasets or synthetic data to\ncompensate for missing modalities.

Towards this goal, we\npropose OmniCharacter, a first seamless speech-language personality interaction\nmodel to achieve immersive RPAs with low latency. Specifically, OmniCharacter\nenables agents to consistently exhibit role-specific personality traits and\nvocal traits throughout the interaction, enabling a mixture of speech and\nlanguage responses.
