For this purpose, we introduce the HistVis\ndataset, a curated collection of 30,000 synthetic images generated by three\nstate-of-the-art diffusion models using carefully designed prompts depicting\nuniversal human activities across different historical periods. We evaluate\ngenerated imagery across three key aspects: (1) Implicit Stylistic\nAssociations: examining default visual styles associated with specific eras;\n(2) Historical Consistency: identifying anachronisms such as modern artifacts\nin pre-modern contexts; and (3) Demographic Representation: comparing generated\nracial and gender distributions against historically plausible baselines. Our\nfindings reveal systematic inaccuracies in historically themed generated\nimagery, as TTI models frequently stereotype past eras by incorporating\nunstated stylistic cues, introduce anachronisms, and fail to reflect plausible\ndemographic patterns.

Addressing\nbias along one dimension - such as ethnicity or age - can inadvertently affect\nanother, like gender, either mitigating or exacerbating existing disparities.\nUnderstanding these interdependencies is crucial for designing fairer\ngenerative models, yet measuring such effects quantitatively remains a\nchallenge. To address this, we introduce BiasConnect, a novel tool for\nanalyzing and quantifying bias interactions in TTI models. BiasConnect uses\ncounterfactual interventions along different bias axes to reveal the underlying\nstructure of these interactions and estimates the effect of mitigating one bias\naxis on another. These estimates show strong correlation (+0.65) with observed\npost-mitigation outcomes.

The model is robust to practical\nchallenges such as handling OCR errors, misspellings, and domain shifts, which\nare critical in real-world deployments. FS-DAG is highly performant with less\nthan 90M parameters, making it well-suited for complex real-world applications\nfor Information Extraction (IE) tasks where computational resources are\nlimited. We demonstrate FS-DAG's capability through extensive experiments for\ninformation extraction task, showing significant improvements in convergence\nspeed and performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Existing methods cannot simulate temporal\nmotions unless high-dose imaging scans including starting and ending frames\nexist simultaneously. However, in the preoperative data acquisition stage, the\nslight movement of patients may result in dynamic backgrounds between the first\nand last frames in a respiratory period.

To\naddress that limitation, we pioneeringly simulate the regular motion process\nvia the image-to-video (I2V) synthesis framework, which animates with the first\nframe to forecast future frames of a given length. Besides, to promote the\ntemporal consistency of animated videos, we devise the Temporal Differential\nDiffusion Model to generate temporal differential fields, which measure the\nrelative differential representations between adjacent frames. The prompt\nattention layer is devised for fine-grained differential fields, and the field\naugmented layer is adopted to better interact these fields with the I2V\nframework, promoting more accurate temporal variation of synthesized videos.\nExtensive results on ACDC cardiac and 4D Lung datasets reveal that our approach\nsimulates 4D videos along the intrinsic motion trajectory, rivaling other\ncompetitive methods on perceptual similarity and temporal consistency.

This thesis proposal investigates\nmethods to align diffusion models using reinforcement learning (RL) and reward\nmodeling. We survey recent advances in fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion\nmodels with human feedback, including reinforcement learning from human and AI\nfeedback, direct preference optimization, and differentiable reward approaches.\nWe classify these methods based on the type of feedback (human, automated,\nbinary or ranked preferences), the fine-tuning technique (policy gradient,\nreward-weighted likelihood, direct backpropagation, etc.), and their efficiency\nand safety outcomes. We compare key algorithms and frameworks, highlighting how\nthey improve alignment with user intent or safety standards, and discuss\ninter-relationships such as how newer methods build on or diverge from earlier\nones.

In existing compression transmission systems, the sender lossily\ncompresses point coordinates and reflectance to generate a transmission code\nstream, which faces transmission burdens from reflectance encoding and limited\ndetection robustness due to information loss. To address these issues, this\npaper proposes a 3D object detection framework with reflectance\nprediction-based knowledge distillation (RPKD). We compress point coordinates\nwhile discarding reflectance during low-bitrate transmission, and feed the\ndecoded non-reflectance compressed point clouds into a student detector. The\ndiscarded reflectance is then reconstructed by a geometry-based reflectance\nprediction (RP) module within the student detector for precise detection. A\nteacher detector with the same structure as student detector is designed for\nperforming reflectance knowledge distillation (RKD) and detection knowledge\ndistillation (DKD) from raw to compressed point clouds. Our RPKD framework\njointly trains detectors on both raw and compressed point clouds to improve the\nstudent detector's robustness.

In traditional domains, \\eg regression and classification, MDT\ntypically relies on dataset merging or multi-head supervision. However, the\ndiversity of skeleton types and limited cross-dataset supervision complicate\nintegration in pose estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce\nPoseBH, a new MDT framework that tackles keypoint heterogeneity and limited\nsupervision through two key techniques. First, we propose nonparametric\nkeypoint prototypes that learn within a unified embedding space, enabling\nseamless integration across skeleton types. Second, we develop a cross-type\nself-supervision mechanism that aligns keypoint predictions with keypoint\nembedding prototypes, providing supervision without relying on teacher-student\nmodels or additional augmentations.

However, existing methods stabilize training\nand enhance rendering quality from steep viewpoints by conditioning the random\nlatent vector on the current camera position. This compromises 3D consistency,\nas we observe significant identity changes when re-synthesizing the 3D head\nwith each camera shift. Conversely, fixing the camera to a single viewpoint\nyields high-quality renderings for that perspective but results in poor\nperformance for novel views. Removing view-conditioning typically destabilizes\nGAN training, often causing the training to collapse. In response to these\nchallenges, we introduce CGS-GAN, a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting GAN framework\nthat enables stable training and high-quality 3D-consistent synthesis of human\nheads without relying on view-conditioning. To ensure training stability, we\nintroduce a multi-view regularization technique that enhances generator\nconvergence with minimal computational overhead. Additionally, we adapt the\nconditional loss used in existing 3D Gaussian splatting GANs and propose a\ngenerator architecture designed to not only stabilize training but also\nfacilitate efficient rendering and straightforward scaling, enabling output\nresolutions up to $2048^2$. To evaluate the capabilities of CGS-GAN, we curate\na new dataset derived from FFHQ. This dataset enables very high resolutions,\nfocuses on larger portions of the human head, reduces view-dependent artifacts\nfor improved 3D consistency, and excludes images where subjects are obscured by\nhands or other objects. As a result, our approach achieves very high rendering\nquality, supported by competitive FID scores, while ensuring consistent 3D\nscene generation.

However, the performance\nof learning-based methods degrades significantly when environmental conditions\nchange, thereby hindering their applicability to new scenarios.

This paper introduces a domain\nincremental learning (DIL) approach for dynamic 5G indoor localization, called\n5G-DIL, enabling rapid adaptation to environmental changes. We present a novel\nsimilarity-aware sampling technique based on the Chebyshev distance, designed\nto efficiently select specific exemplars from the previous environment while\ntraining only on the modified regions of the new environment. This avoids the\nneed to train on the entire region, significantly reducing the time and\nresources required for adaptation without compromising localization accuracy.\nThis approach requires as few as 50 exemplars from adaptation domains,\nsignificantly reducing training time while maintaining high positioning\naccuracy in previous environments. Comparative evaluations against\nstate-of-the-art DIL techniques on a challenging real-world indoor dataset\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed sample selection method. Our\napproach is adaptable to real-world non-line-of-sight propagation scenarios and\nachieves an MAE positioning error of 0.261 meters, even under dynamic\nenvironmental conditions.

While existing methods generate\nsafety-critical driving trajectories, simulations, or single-view videos, they\nfall short of meeting the demands of advanced end-to-end autonomous systems\n(E2E AD), which require real-world, multi-view video data. To bridge this gap,\nwe introduce SafeMVDrive, the first framework designed to generate\nhigh-quality, safety-critical, multi-view driving videos grounded in real-world\ndomains. SafeMVDrive strategically integrates a safety-critical trajectory\ngenerator with an advanced multi-view video generator. To tackle the challenges\ninherent in this integration, we first enhance scene understanding ability of\nthe trajectory generator by incorporating visual context -- which is previously\nunavailable to such generator -- and leveraging a GRPO-finetuned\nvision-language model to achieve more realistic and context-aware trajectory\ngeneration. Second, recognizing that existing multi-view video generators\nstruggle to render realistic collision events, we introduce a two-stage,\ncontrollable trajectory generation mechanism that produces collision-evasion\ntrajectories, ensuring both video quality and safety-critical fidelity.\nFinally, we employ a diffusion-based multi-view video generator to synthesize\nhigh-quality safety-critical driving videos from the generated trajectories.\nExperiments conducted on an E2E AD planner demonstrate a significant increase\nin collision rate when tested with our generated data, validating the\neffectiveness of SafeMVDrive in stress-testing planning modules.

Recently, bird's-eye view (BEV)-based perception approaches have\nemerged as superior alternatives to perspective-based solutions, offering\nenhanced spatial understanding and more natural outputs for planning. Existing\nBEV-based 3D object detection methods, typically adhering to angle-based\nrepresentation, directly estimate the size and orientation of rotated bounding\nboxes. We observe that BEV-based 3D object detection is analogous to aerial\noriented object detection, where angle-based methods are recognized for being\naffected by discontinuities in their loss functions.

Existing transferable attack methods face two major challenges: 1)\nthey heavily rely on the assumption that the decision boundaries of the\nsurrogate (a.k.a., source) model and the target model are similar, which limits\nthe adversarial transferability; and 2) their decision boundary difference\nmakes the attack direction uncertain, which may result in the gradient\noscillation, weakening the adversarial attack. This motivates us to propose a\nBackground Mixup-induced Temporal Consistency (BMTC) attack method for action\nrecognition. From the input transformation perspective, we design a\nmodel-agnostic background adversarial mixup module to reduce the\nsurrogate-target model dependency. In particular, we randomly sample one video\nfrom each category and make its background frame, while selecting the\nbackground frame with the top attack ability for mixup with the clean frame by\nreinforcement learning. Moreover, to ensure an explicit attack direction, we\nleverage the background category as guidance for updating the gradient of\nadversarial example, and design a temporal gradient consistency loss, which\nstrengthens the stability of the attack direction on subsequent frames.\nEmpirical studies on two video datasets, i.e., UCF101 and Kinetics-400, and one\nimage dataset, i.e., ImageNet, demonstrate that our method significantly boosts\nthe transferability of adversarial examples across several action/image\nrecognition models.

However, complex modal differences between heterogeneous spectra pose\nchallenges to efficiently utilizing complementary and discrepancy of spectra\ninformation. Most existing methods fuse spectral data through intricate modal\ninteraction modules, lacking fine-grained semantic understanding of spectral\ninformation (\\textit{e.g.}, text descriptions, part masks, and object\nkeypoints). To solve this challenge, we propose a novel Identity-Conditional\ntext Prompt Learning framework (ICPL), which exploits the powerful cross-modal\nalignment capability of CLIP, to unify different spectral visual features from\ntext semantics. Specifically, we first propose the online prompt learning using\nlearnable text prompt as the identity-level semantic center to bridge the\nidentity semantics of different spectra in online manner. Then, in lack of\nconcrete text descriptions, we propose the multi-spectral identity-condition\nmodule to use identity prototype as spectral identity condition to constraint\nprompt learning. Meanwhile, we construct the alignment loop mutually optimizing\nthe learnable text prompt and spectral visual encoder to avoid online prompt\nlearning disrupting the pre-trained text-image alignment distribution.

However, existing methods often fail to fully leverage both the\nglobal correlations and local smoothness of the background components in\nhyperspectral images (HSIs), which exist in both the spectral and spatial\ndomains. This limitation results in suboptimal detection performance. To\nmitigate this critical issue, we put forward a novel HAD method named\nHAD-EUNTRFR, which incorporates an enhanced unified nonconvex tensor ring (TR)\nfactors regularization. In the HAD-EUNTRFR framework, the raw HSIs are first\ndecomposed into background and anomaly components. The TR decomposition is then\nemployed to capture the spatial-spectral correlations within the background\ncomponent. Additionally, we introduce a unified and efficient nonconvex\nregularizer, induced by tensor singular value decomposition (TSVD), to\nsimultaneously encode the low-rankness and sparsity of the 3-D gradient TR\nfactors into a unique concise form. The above characterization scheme enables\nthe interpretable gradient TR factors to inherit the low-rankness and\nsmoothness of the original background. To further enhance anomaly detection, we\ndesign a generalized nonconvex regularization term to exploit the group\nsparsity of the anomaly component. To solve the resulting doubly nonconvex\nmodel, we develop a highly efficient optimization algorithm based on the\nalternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework.

DiffusionReward effectively\novercomes the limitations of diffusion-based methods, which often fail to\ngenerate realistic facial details and exhibit poor identity consistency. The\ncore of our framework is the Face Reward Model (FRM), which is trained using\ncarefully annotated data. It provides feedback signals that play a pivotal role\nin steering the optimization process of the restoration network. In particular,\nour ReFL framework incorporates a gradient flow into the denoising process of\noff-the-shelf face restoration methods to guide the update of model parameters.\nThe guiding gradient is collaboratively determined by three aspects: (i) the\nFRM to ensure the perceptual quality of the restored faces; (ii) a\nregularization term that functions as a safeguard to preserve generative\ndiversity; and (iii) a structural consistency constraint to maintain facial\nfidelity. Furthermore, the FRM undergoes dynamic optimization throughout the\nprocess. It not only ensures that the restoration network stays precisely\naligned with the real face manifold, but also effectively prevents reward\nhacking.

Classical handcrafted methods such as SIFT feature\ndetection and description combined with nearest neighbour matching and RANSAC\noutlier removal have been state-of-the-art for mobile mapping cameras. With\nrecent advances in deep learning, learnable methods have been introduced and\nproven to have better robustness and performance under complex conditions.\nDespite their growing adoption, a comprehensive comparison between classical\nand learnable feature matching methods for the specific task of semantic 3D\nbuilding camera-to-model matching is still missing.

We use\nstandard benchmark datasets (HPatches, MegaDepth-1500) and custom datasets\nconsisting of facade textures and corresponding camera images (terrestrial and\ndrone). For the latter, we evaluate the achievable accuracy of the absolute\npose estimated using a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm, with geometric\nground truth derived from geo-referenced trajectory data.

A key trend involves\nleveraging multi-scale information to better represent hierarchical tissue\nstructures. However, existing methods often face two key limitations: (1)\ninsufficient modeling of interactions within the same modalities across scales\n(e.g., 5x and 20x) and (2) inadequate alignment between visual and textual\nmodalities on the same scale. To address these gaps, we propose HiVE-MIL, a\nhierarchical vision-language framework that constructs a unified graph\nconsisting of (1) parent-child links between coarse (5x) and fine (20x)\nvisual/textual nodes to capture hierarchical relationships, and (2)\nheterogeneous intra-scale edges linking visual and textual nodes on the same\nscale. To further enhance semantic consistency, HiVE-MIL incorporates a\ntwo-stage, text-guided dynamic filtering mechanism that removes weakly\ncorrelated patch-text pairs, and introduces a hierarchical contrastive loss to\nalign textual semantics across scales. Extensive experiments on TCGA breast,\nlung, and kidney cancer datasets demonstrate that HiVE-MIL consistently\noutperforms both traditional MIL and recent VLM-based MIL approaches, achieving\ngains of up to 4.1% in macro F1 under 16-shot settings.

Critically, the widely used ICP-based estimator provides the worst\nbenchmarking performance, as it significantly alters the true ranking of the\ntop-5 reconstruction methods. Notably, the correlation of ICP with the true\nerror can be as low as 0.41. Moreover, non-rigid alignment leads to significant\nimprovement (correlation larger than 0.90), highlighting the importance of\nannotating 3D landmarks on datasets.

The framework is deployed on the Retrofit\ncamera, a cost-effective edge device retrofitted into thousands of vehicles,\ndespite strict limitations on compute performance and memory. Our approach\ndistills the knowledge of the CLIP model into a lightweight student model,\ncombining EfficientNet-B3 with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) projection heads to\npreserve cross-modal alignment while significantly reducing computational\nrequirements. We demonstrate that our distilled model achieves a balance\nbetween efficiency and performance, making it ideal for deployment in\nreal-world scenarios. Experimental results show that Clip4Retrofit can perform\nreal-time image labeling and object identification on edge devices with limited\nresources, offering a practical solution for applications such as autonomous\ndriving and retrofitting existing systems.

We perform comprehensive evaluation on multiple\nlong video understanding benchmarks that demonstrates the advantage of the\nentire system design. Our DVD agent achieves SOTA performance, significantly\nsurpassing prior works by a large margin on the challenging LVBench dataset.\nComprehensive ablation studies and in-depth tool analyses are also provided,\nyielding insights to further advance intelligent agents tailored for long-form\nvideo understanding tasks.

Autoregressive models typically rely on image\ntokenizers to compress images into discrete tokens for sequential prediction,\nwhereas diffusion models often operate on continuous latent space to reduce\ncomputational costs. However, both visual compression approaches inevitably\nlose visual information, thereby limiting the upper bound of visual generation\nquality. To evaluate how these compression losses affect text and faces, the\nmost human-sensitive visual elements, we first collect and curate a collection\nof text and faces images from existing datasets, ensuring clarity and\ndiversity. For text reconstruction, we employ OCR models to assess the\nrecognition accuracy of the reconstructed text, and then we measure feature\nsimilarity between original and reconstructed faces thereby quantifying faces\nreconstruction fidelity. Our method is highly lightweight, requiring just 2GB\nmemory and 4 minutes to complete evaluations. With our benchmark, we analyze\nthe reconstruction quality of text and faces at various scales across different\nimage tokenizers and VAEs.

REN\nbypasses this bottleneck using a lightweight module that directly generates\nregion tokens, enabling 60x faster token generation with 35x less memory, while\nalso improving token quality. It uses a few cross-attention blocks that take\npoint prompts as queries and features from a patch-based image encoder as keys\nand values to produce region tokens that correspond to the prompted objects. We\ntrain REN with three popular encoders-DINO, DINOv2, and OpenCLIP-and show that\nit can be extended to other encoders without dedicated training.

With high-quality MOCAP data\nbecoming more available recently, a wide range of data-driven approaches have\nbeen presented.

In this paper, we present Graph-driven Interaction\nSampling, a method that can generate realistic and diverse multi-person\ninteractions by leveraging existing two-person motion diffusion models as\nmotion priors. Instead of training a new model specific to multi-person\ninteraction synthesis, our key insight is to spatially and temporally separate\ncomplex multi-person interactions into a graph structure of two-person\ninteractions, which we name the Pairwise Interaction Graph. We thus decompose\nthe generation task into simultaneous single-person motion generation\nconditioned on one other's motion. In addition, to reduce artifacts such as\ninterpenetrations of body parts in generated multi-person interactions, we\nintroduce two graph-dependent guidance terms into the diffusion sampling\nscheme.

However, its adoption is limited by the\nhigh cost of expert annotations required for training and inter-observer\nvariability in datasets. While weakly-supervised methods mitigate some\nchallenges, using binary histology labels for training as opposed to requiring\nfull segmentation, they require large paired datasets of histology and images,\nwhich are difficult to curate. Similarly, promptable segmentation aims to allow\nsegmentation with no re-training for new tasks at inference, however, existing\nmodels perform poorly on pathological regions, again necessitating large\ndatasets for training. In this work we propose a novel approach for promptable\nsegmentation requiring only 24 fully-segmented images, supplemented by 8\nweakly-labelled images, for training. Curating this minimal data to a high\nstandard is relatively feasible and thus issues with the cost and variability\nof obtaining labels can be mitigated. By leveraging two classifiers, one\nweakly-supervised and one fully-supervised, our method refines segmentation\nthrough a guided search process initiated by a single-point prompt. Our\napproach outperforms existing promptable segmentation methods, and performs\ncomparably with fully-supervised methods, for the task of prostate cancer\nsegmentation, while using substantially less annotated data (up to 100X less).\nThis enables promptable segmentation with very minimal labelled data, such that\nthe labels can be curated to a very high standard.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u63d0\u793a\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0824\u5f20\u5168\u6807\u6ce8\u548c8\u5f20\u5f31\u6807\u6ce8\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u5272\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u764c\u75c7\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u56f0\u96be\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u75c5\u7406\u533a\u57df\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u70b9\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u641c\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u5272\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u63d0\u793a\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f7f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002"}}

The\ninductive bias of diffusion-based adversarial purification aligns naturally\nwith the adversarial attack process, where both involving noise addition,\nreducing dependency on surrogate white-box model selection.

Real video games are crafted to be\nintuitive for humans to learn and master by leveraging innate inductive biases,\nmaking them an ideal testbed for evaluating such capabilities in VLMs. To this\nend, we introduce VideoGameBench, a benchmark consisting of 10 popular video\ngames from the 1990s that VLMs directly interact with in real-time.\nVideoGameBench challenges models to complete entire games with access to only\nraw visual inputs and a high-level description of objectives and controls, a\nsignificant departure from existing setups that rely on game-specific\nscaffolding and auxiliary information. We keep three of the games secret to\nencourage solutions that generalize to unseen environments. Our experiments\nshow that frontier vision-language models struggle to progress beyond the\nbeginning of each game. We find inference latency to be a major limitation of\nfrontier models in the real-time setting; therefore, we introduce\nVideoGameBench Lite, a setting where the game pauses while waiting for the LM's\nnext action. The best performing model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, completes only 0.48% of\nVideoGameBench and 1.6% of VideoGameBench Lite.

Project website:\n  https://kyleleey.github.io/WonderPlay/", "summary": "WonderPlay is a novel framework integrating physics simulation with video\ngeneration for generating action-conditioned dynamic 3D scenes from a single\nimage. While prior works are restricted to rigid body or simple elastic\ndynamics, WonderPlay features a hybrid generative simulator to synthesize a\nwide range of 3D dynamics. The hybrid generative simulator first uses a physics\nsolver to simulate coarse 3D dynamics, which subsequently conditions a video\ngenerator to produce a video with finer, more realistic motion. The generated\nvideo is then used to update the simulated dynamic 3D scene, closing the loop\nbetween the physics solver and the video generator. This approach enables\nintuitive user control to be combined with the accurate dynamics of\nphysics-based simulators and the expressivity of diffusion-based video\ngenerators. Experimental results demonstrate that WonderPlay enables users to\ninteract with various scenes of diverse content, including cloth, sand, snow,\nliquid, smoke, elastic, and rigid bodies -- all using a single image input.\nCode will be made public.
