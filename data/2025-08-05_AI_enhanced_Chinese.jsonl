Results demonstrate that the approaches perform\nwell, with SSIM metrics increasing from 0.69 to 0.82, indicating that hybrid\nmodels utilizing 3DCNNs and ConvLSTMs are the most effective, and greyscale\nvideos with real data are the easiest to predict.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548cRNN\u30013D CNN\u7b49\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a3D CNN\u548cConvLSTM\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765AI\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u548cRNN\u30013D CNN\u7b49\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u826f\u597d\uff0cSSIM\u6307\u6807\u4ece0.69\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.82\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d3D CNN\u548cConvLSTM\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u7070\u5ea6\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u6700\u5bb9\u6613\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c3D CNN\u548cConvLSTM\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Recent works show that when\ntrained from scratch, recurrent models achieve better results than feedforward\nmodels in these tasks. However, when leveraging self-supervised pre-trained\nweights, feedforward models can outperform their recurrent counterparts.\nCurrent self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for event-based pre-training\nlargely mimic RGB image-based approaches. They pre-train feedforward models on\nraw events within a short time interval, ignoring the temporal information of\nevents. In this work, we introduce TESPEC, a self-supervised pre-training\nframework tailored for learning spatio-temporal information. TESPEC is\nwell-suited for recurrent models, as it is the first framework to leverage long\nevent sequences during pre-training. TESPEC employs the masked image modeling\nparadigm with a new reconstruction target. We design a novel method to\naccumulate events into pseudo grayscale videos containing high-level semantic\ninformation about the underlying scene, which is robust to sensor noise and\nreduces motion blur. Reconstructing this target thus requires the model to\nreason about long-term history of events. Extensive experiments demonstrate our\nstate-of-the-art results in downstream tasks, including object detection,\nsemantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation.

Code:\n  https://github.com/FengheTan9/Mobile-U-ViT", "summary": "In clinical practice, medical image analysis often requires efficient\nexecution on resource-constrained mobile devices. However, existing mobile\nmodels-primarily optimized for natural images-tend to perform poorly on medical\ntasks due to the significant information density gap between natural and\nmedical domains. Combining computational efficiency with medical\nimaging-specific architectural advantages remains a challenge when developing\nlightweight, universal, and high-performing networks. To address this, we\npropose a mobile model called Mobile U-shaped Vision Transformer (Mobile U-ViT)\ntailored for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we employ the newly\npurposed ConvUtr as a hierarchical patch embedding, featuring a\nparameter-efficient large-kernel CNN with inverted bottleneck fusion. This\ndesign exhibits transformer-like representation learning capacity while being\nlighter and faster. To enable efficient local-global information exchange, we\nintroduce a novel Large-kernel Local-Global-Local (LGL) block that effectively\nbalances the low information density and high-level semantic discrepancy of\nmedical images. Finally, we incorporate a shallow and lightweight transformer\nbottleneck for long-range modeling and employ a cascaded decoder with\ndownsample skip connections for dense prediction.

Existing methods struggle\nwith two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset\nQuantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level\noptimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to\nover-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical\nproblem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an\ninformation carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that\nimproving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation\nlearning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework\nwith Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes\nthe latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather\nthan creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior\nperformance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across\nmultiple benchmarks.

In\naddition, we propose a dual auxiliary loss to explicitly constrain dual\nbranches, preventing the network from relying only on global semantic\ninformation from the deep large receptive field and ignoring the local texture.\nThe proposed RoadMamba achieves the state-of-the-art performance in experiments\non a large-scale road surface classification dataset containing 1 million\nsamples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faRoadMamba\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9053\u8def\u8868\u9762\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DualSSM\u548cDAF\u5b9e\u73b0\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u524d\u83b7\u53d6\u9053\u8def\u8868\u9762\u6761\u4ef6\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u8212\u9002\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709Mamba\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u7eb9\u7406\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRoadMamba\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528DualSSM\u63d0\u53d6\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DAF\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u878d\u5408\u53cc\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u8f85\u52a9\u635f\u5931\u7ea6\u675f\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b100\u4e07\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9053\u8def\u8868\u9762\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRoadMamba\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RoadMamba\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u8868\u9762\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper,\nwe propose StyDeco, an unsupervised framework that resolves this limitation by\nlearning text representations specifically tailored for the style transfer\ntask.

It\nleverages a powerful frozen generative model to automatically synthesize\npseudo-paired data. Subsequently, we introduce Contrastive Semantic Decoupling\n(CSD), a task-specific objective that adapts a text encoder using\ndomain-specific weights. CSD performs a two-class clustering in the semantic\nspace, encouraging source and target representations to form distinct clusters.\nExtensive experiments on three classic benchmarks demonstrate that our\nframework outperforms several existing approaches in both stylistic fidelity\nand structural preservation, highlighting its effectiveness in style transfer\nwith semantic preservation.

Our framework first builds a strong foundation via Cross-Modal\nSemantic Consistency and then specializes the encoder through Self-Enhancement.\nIn the first stage, we focus on Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency. By mining\nconsistency between generated image-text pairs at the instance, cluster\nassignment, and cluster center levels, we train lightweight clustering heads to\nalign with the rich semantics of the pre-trained model. This alignment process\nis bolstered by a novel method for generating higher-quality cluster centers\nand a dynamic balancing regularizer to ensure well-distributed assignments. In\nthe second stage, we introduce a Self-Enhanced fine-tuning strategy. The\nwell-aligned model from the first stage acts as a reliable pseudo-label\ngenerator. These self-generated supervisory signals are then used to feed back\nthe efficient, joint optimization of the vision encoder and clustering heads,\nunlocking their full potential. Extensive experiments on six mainstream\ndatasets show that our method outperforms existing deep clustering methods by\nsignificant margins.

Then, to reconstruct data\ncorrectly and continually, an efficient Kernel Attention with learnable Advisor\n(KAA) mechanism is proposed, which learns the information from new categories\nwhile discarding redundant old information within both the encoder and decoder.\nFinally, to keep the representation consistency over tasks, a Reconstruction\nwith Parameter Perturbation (RPP) module is proposed by designing a\nrepresentation rehearsal loss function, which ensures that the model remembers\nprevious category information and returns category-adaptive\nrepresentation.Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an average performance of\n66.4%, 83.1%, and 63.4% AUROC on Real3D-AD, Anomaly-ShapeNet, and MulSen-AD,\nrespectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aC3D-AD\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e3D\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u591a\u7c7b\u70b9\u4e91\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165KAL\u63d0\u53d6\u901a\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\uff0cKAA\u673a\u5236\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u4e22\u5f03\u5197\u4f59\u65e7\u4fe1\u606f\uff0cRPP\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u793a\u6392\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747AUROC\u5206\u522b\u4e3a66.4%\u300183.1%\u548c63.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "C3D-AD\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u7c7b3D\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u3002"}}

In this paper,\nwe propose ViLaCo, a vision-language collaborative reasoning framework that\nintroduces auxiliary semantic supervision distilled from pre-trained\nvision-language models (VLMs), enabling accurate pixel-level localization using\nonly image-level labels. Specifically, ViLaCo first incorporates semantic\nknowledge through a vision-language feature modeling network, which jointly\nextracts textual and visual priors using pre-trained VLMs. Next, an adaptive\nvision-language reasoning network aligns textual semantics and visual features\nthrough mutual interactions, producing semantically aligned representations.\nSubsequently, these representations are passed into dual prediction heads,\nwhere the coarse head performs image-level classification and the fine head\ngenerates pixel-level localization masks, thereby bridging the gap between weak\nsupervision and fine-grained localization.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage\nRefined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives\nwithin a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main\ninnovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature\nre-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during\nboth the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the\nTraining mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating\npedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby\nconstructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.\nDuring the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the\nClassifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into\nthe proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through\npedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm\nvertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region\nproposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,\nfiltering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores.

Specifically, although linear\nattention mechanisms and their variants have made progress in lightweight\ndesign, they still fail to meet the demands of hybrid models for long-sequence\nmodeling. On the other hand, existing lightweight SoftMax attention\ncomputations typically reduce the feature map to a fixed size to decrease the\nnumber of sequences, thereby compressing the computational scale. However, the\nprocess of determining the feature map reduction ratio is cumbersome, and\ncomputational saturation issues still persist. To address this issue, this\npaper proposes a lightweight SoftMax attention mechanism with adaptive feature\nmap sizes, named Fast Window Attention (FWA), which generates a small number of\nkey sequences (Key and Value) through window aggregation for attention\ncomputation. Additionally, it explains the rationality of using ReLU to\nsimulate SoftMax operations in lightweight global attention mechanisms.\nFinally, the paper designs a global-local feature fusion mechanism and combines\nit with GhostNet to propose a lightweight hybrid backbone network, LOLViT.\nThrough visual tasks such as classification (ImageNet 1K), detection (COCO\n2017), and segmentation (BDD100K), along with extensive ablation studies, it is\ndemonstrated that LOLViT outperforms CNN models of the same level in both\ninference speed and model accuracy.

Most existing\nattribute-based retrieval methods operate under the closed-set assumption that\nall attribute classes are consistently available during both training and\ninference. However, this assumption limits their applicability in real-world\nscenarios where novel attributes may emerge. Moreover, predefined attributes in\nbenchmark datasets are often generic and shared across individuals, making them\nless discriminative for retrieving the target person. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Open-Attribute Recognition for Person Retrieval\n(OAPR) task, which aims to retrieve individuals based on attribute cues,\nregardless of whether those attributes were seen during training.

Specifically, SPL features two key attributes: (i) Dynamic\nadaptation, transitioning from static domain alignment to flexible, task-driven\nfeature optimization, enabling models to evolve with downstream scenarios; (ii)\nVFM-centric tuning, leveraging pretrained knowledge as a pivot to hone\ntask-specific representations while preserving cross-domain robustness.\nBuilding on SPL, we propose a Dynamic Prompt Fine-Tuning method, which combines\na Dynamic Class-aware Prompter with a Prompt-guided Feature Focuser, to elevate\nVFM performance in targeted scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark\ndatasets show the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its superiority\nover state-of-the-art methods, particularly in generalized segmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Set Pivot Learning (SPL)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b(VFMs)\u7684\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316(DG)\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u548cVFM\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfDG\u5047\u8bbe\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4e0d\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u4f46VFMs\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u4f7f\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\u8fc7\u65f6\u3002SPL\u65e8\u5728\u66f4\u9002\u5e94\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "SPL\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u548cVFM\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u5668\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u7126\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "SPL\u4e3a\u9886\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

However, in real clinical scenarios,\ndue to differences in incidence rates, multimodal medical data commonly face\nthe issue of class imbalance, which makes it difficult to adequately learn the\nfeatures of minority classes. Most existing methods tackle this issue with\nresampling or loss reweighting, but they are prone to overfitting or\nunderfitting and fail to capture cross-modal interactions. Therefore, we\npropose a Curriculum Learning framework for Imbalanced Multimodal Diagnosis\n(CLIMD).

To\novercome these limitations, we present Rein++, an efficient VFM-based\nsegmentation framework that demonstrates superior generalization from limited\ndata and enables effective adaptation to diverse unlabeled scenarios.\nSpecifically, Rein++ comprises a domain generalization solution Rein-G and a\ndomain adaptation solution Rein-A. Rein-G introduces a set of trainable,\ninstance-aware tokens that effectively refine the VFM's features for the\nsegmentation task. This parameter-efficient approach fine-tunes less than 1% of\nthe backbone's parameters, enabling robust generalization. Building on the\nRein-G, Rein-A performs unsupervised domain adaptation at both the instance and\nlogit levels to mitigate domain shifts. In addition, it incorporates a semantic\ntransfer module that leverages the class-agnostic capabilities of the segment\nanything model to enhance boundary details in the target domain. The integrated\nRein++ pipeline first learns a generalizable model on a source domain (e.g.,\ndaytime scenes) and subsequently adapts it to diverse target domains (e.g.,\nnighttime scenes) without any target labels. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Rein++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with\nefficient training, underscoring its roles an efficient, generalizable, and\nadaptive segmentation solution for VFMs, even for large models with billions of\nparameters.

Firstly, the Gaussian map of the old scene is\ngenerated using our proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting.

Our anchor-graph\nstructure not only promotes compact and instance-aware Gaussian distributions,\nbut also facilitates graph-based propagation, achieving a clean and accurate\ninstance-level Gaussian selection. Extensive validation across four\napplications, i.e. interactive click-based query, open-vocabulary text-driven\nquery, object removal editing, and physics simulation, demonstrates the\nadvantages of our approach and its benefits to various applications.

However, event networks\nheavily rely on task-specific designs due to the unstructured data distribution\nand spatial-temporal (S-T) inhomogeneity, making it hard to reuse existing\narchitectures for new tasks. We propose OmniEvent, the first unified event\nrepresentation learning framework that achieves SOTA performance across diverse\ntasks, fully removing the need of task-specific designs. Unlike previous\nmethods that treat event data as 3D point clouds with manually tuned S-T\nscaling weights, OmniEvent proposes a decouple-enhance-fuse paradigm, where the\nlocal feature aggregation and enhancement is done independently on the spatial\nand temporal domains to avoid inhomogeneity issues. Space-filling curves are\napplied to enable large receptive fields while improving memory and compute\nefficiency. The features from individual domains are then fused by attention to\nlearn S-T interactions. The output of OmniEvent is a grid-shaped tensor, which\nenables standard vision models to process event data without architecture\nchange. With a unified framework and similar hyper-parameters, OmniEvent\nout-performs (tasks-specific) SOTA by up to 68.2% across 3 representative tasks\nand 10 datasets (Fig.1).

This comprehensive survey examines the\nevolving landscape of adversarial techniques, revealing their dual nature as\nboth sophisticated security threats and valuable defensive tools. We provide a\nsystematic analysis of adversarial attack methodologies across three primary\ndomains: pixel-space attacks, physically realizable attacks, and latent-space\nattacks. Our investigation traces the technical evolution from early\ngradient-based methods such as FGSM and PGD to sophisticated optimization\ntechniques incorporating momentum, adaptive step sizes, and advanced\ntransferability mechanisms. We examine how physically realizable attacks have\nsuccessfully bridged the gap between digital vulnerabilities and real-world\nthreats through adversarial patches, 3D textures, and dynamic optical\nperturbations. Additionally, we explore the emergence of latent-space attacks\nthat leverage semantic structure in internal representations to create more\ntransferable and meaningful adversarial examples.

Beyond traditional\nsingle-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various\nobject classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade\nstandard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled\nBackdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured\ndisentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor\nthreats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image\nrepresentations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in\nthe embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By\nleveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes\nthe latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual\nprompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships\nbetween triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and\nobject representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the\ntrigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling\ntrigger and object visual features. Next, by aligning image features with\nfeature decomposition and fusion, as well as learned contextual prompt tokens\nin a shared multimodal space, DBOM enables zero-shot generalization to novel\ntrigger-object pairings that were unseen during training, thereby offering\ndeeper insights into adversarial attack patterns. Experimental results on\nCIFAR-10 and GTSRB demonstrate that DBOM robustly detects poisoned images prior\nto downstream training, significantly enhancing the security of DNN training\npipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "DBOM\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u591a\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347DNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u4e3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u6b64\u7c7b\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "method": "DBOM\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u8026\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u5e93\u548c\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5206\u79bb\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u548cGTSRB\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDBOM\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6bd2\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DBOM\u4e3a\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e3b\u52a8\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u672a\u89c1\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

This limitation has led to efforts to generate images\nconditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work\nmodifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated\nimages by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt.\nThis enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer,\ngenerally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two\ncommon issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate\nimages that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches\nneglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance.\nSpecifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired\nconditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve\nthis, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired\nconditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image\nprompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention\nmodifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image\nand alignment with the image prompt.

However, current performance evaluation protocols\nfor VLM-based AD systems (ADVLMs) are predominantly confined to open-loop\nsettings with static inputs, neglecting the more realistic and informative\nclosed-loop setting that captures interactive behavior, feedback resilience,\nand real-world safety. To address this, we introduce Bench2ADVLM, a unified\nhierarchical closed-loop evaluation framework for real-time, interactive\nassessment of ADVLMs across both simulation and physical platforms. Inspired by\ndual-process theories of cognition, we first adapt diverse ADVLMs to simulation\nenvironments via a dual-system adaptation architecture. In this design,\nheterogeneous high-level driving commands generated by target ADVLMs (fast\nsystem) are interpreted by a general-purpose VLM (slow system) into\nstandardized mid-level control actions suitable for execution in simulation. To\nbridge the gap between simulation and reality, we design a physical control\nabstraction layer that translates these mid-level actions into low-level\nactuation signals, enabling, for the first time, closed-loop testing of ADVLMs\non physical vehicles. To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM\nintroduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically\nexplores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for\nsafety-critical scenario generation.

To this end, we present a new validation set for traffic signs derived\nfrom the Mapillary dataset called Mapillary Vistas Validation for Traffic Signs\n(MVV), where we decompose composite traffic signs into granular, semantically\nmeaningful categories. The dataset includes pixel-level instance masks and has\nbeen manually annotated by expert annotators to ensure label fidelity.

Compared to traditional methods based on\nTransformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based\napproaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic\nnature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often\nfail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted\nframes, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in\npredicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes\nStarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates\nhistorical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to\nsignificantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose\npredictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose\nmapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating\npreviously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose\nIntegration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative\nhistorical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring\ntemporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play\nSpatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the\ndenoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial\nanatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and\nrealistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving\nsuperior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation.

Traditional\nfree-text reports suffer from redundancy and inconsistent language,\ncomplicating the extraction of critical clinical details. Structured radiology\nreport generation (S-RRG) offers a promising solution by organizing information\ninto standardized, concise formats. However, existing approaches often rely on\nclassification or visual question answering (VQA) pipelines that require\npredefined label sets and produce only fragmented outputs. Template-based\napproaches, which generate reports by replacing keywords within fixed sentence\npatterns, further compromise expressiveness and often omit clinically important\ndetails. In this work, we present a novel approach to S-RRG that includes\ndataset construction, model training, and the introduction of a new evaluation\nframework. We first create a robust chest X-ray dataset (MIMIC-STRUC) that\nincludes disease names, severity levels, probabilities, and anatomical\nlocations, ensuring that the dataset is both clinically relevant and\nwell-structured.

Further downstream applications demonstrate the capacity of our method\nto improve visual object recognition and cross-modal semantic understanding.\nCode is available at https://github.com/BNU-ERC-ITEA/DeflareMamba.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faDeflareMamba\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u6548\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u955c\u5934\u5149\u6655\u53bb\u9664\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u955c\u5934\u5149\u6655\u53bb\u9664\u56e0\u5149\u4e0e\u76f8\u673a\u955c\u5934\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5149\u5b66\u4ea4\u4e92\u800c\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6b65\u957f\u91c7\u6837\u6a21\u5f0f\u5efa\u7acb\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u50cf\u7d20\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u589e\u5f3a\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u7559\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u53bb\u9664\u591a\u79cd\u5149\u6655\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u975e\u5149\u6655\u533a\u57df\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u5916\u89c2\u3002", "conclusion": "DeflareMamba\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5165\u5149\u6655\u53bb\u9664\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, quantized models often suffer from severe performance\ndegradation in dynamic environments with potential domain shifts and this\ndegradation is significantly more pronounced compared with their full-precision\ncounterparts, as shown by our theoretical and empirical illustrations. To\naddress the domain shift problem, test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an\neffective solution by enabling models to learn adaptively from test data.\nUnfortunately, existing TTA methods are often impractical for quantized models\nas they typically rely on gradient backpropagation--an operation that is\nunsupported on quantized models due to vanishing gradients, as well as memory\nand latency constraints.

However, AT creates an inherent trade-off\nbetween clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, which is commonly attributed\nto the more complicated decision boundary caused by the insufficient learning\nof hard adversarial samples. In this work, we reveal a counterintuitive fact\nfor the first time: From the perspective of perception consistency, hard\nadversarial samples that can still attack the robust model after AT are already\nlearned better than those successfully defended. Thus, different from previous\nviews, we argue that it is rather the over-sufficient learning of hard\nadversarial samples that degrades the decision boundary and contributes to the\ntrade-off problem. Specifically, the excessive pursuit of perception\nconsistency would force the model to view the perturbations as noise and ignore\nthe information within them, which should have been utilized to induce a\nsmoother perception transition towards the decision boundary to support its\nestablishment to an appropriate location.

However, their low inference speed limits their\ndeployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches\nexploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past\nrepresentations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer\ninstead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.\nHowever, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,\nattention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate\nfeatures, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it\nadopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of\npredictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when\nprediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to\nbetter leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor\nprediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly\nreducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong\nsequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error\nbetween the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an\nindicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor\nprediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation,\nthereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism.

However, through an\nin-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a\npreviously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information\nbut also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality\nbias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both\nvisual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of\nuser-provided instructions.

To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a novel divide-and-decode framework for multi-shot fMRI\nvideo reconstruction.

However, their visual complexity may interfere with surveillance\nsystems that rely on vision-based object detection models. In this study, we\ninvestigate the impact of asphalt art on pedestrian detection performance of a\npretrained vision-based object detection model. We construct realistic\ncrosswalk scenarios by compositing various street art patterns into a fixed\nsurveillance scene and evaluate the model's performance in detecting\npedestrians on asphalt-arted crosswalks under both benign and adversarial\nconditions. A benign case refers to pedestrian crosswalks painted with existing\nnormal asphalt art, whereas an adversarial case involves digitally crafted or\naltered asphalt art perpetrated by an attacker.

While\nFederated Learning (FL) presents a collaborative and privacy-preserving\napproach to model training, ensuring fairness is challenging due to\nheterogeneous data across institutions, and current research primarily\naddresses non-medical applications. To fill this gap, we establish the first\nexperimental benchmark for fairness in medical FL, evaluating six\nrepresentative FL methods across diverse demographic attributes and imaging\nmodalities. We introduce FairFedMed, the first medical FL dataset specifically\ndesigned to study group fairness (i.e., demographics). It comprises two parts:\nFairFedMed-Oph, featuring 2D fundus and 3D OCT ophthalmology samples with six\ndemographic attributes; and FairFedMed-Chest, which simulates real\ncross-institutional FL using subsets of CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR. Together, they\nsupport both simulated and real-world FL across diverse medical modalities and\ndemographic groups. Existing FL models often underperform on medical images and\noverlook fairness across demographic groups.

Diagnostic accuracy was compared in three experimental\nsettings: visual input only, multimodal input, and chain-of-thought reasoning.\nModel accuracy was assessed against ground truth labels, with statistical\ncomparisons using bootstrapped confidence intervals (p<.05). Qwen2.5 achieved\nthe highest accuracy for chest radiographs (90.4%) and endoscopy images\n(84.2%), significantly outperforming the other models (p<.001). In colon\npathology, Qwen2.5 (69.0%) and Phi-4 (69.6%) performed comparably (p=.41), both\nsignificantly exceeding other VLMs (p<.001). Similarly, for neonatal jaundice\nassessment, Qwen2.5 (58.3%) and Phi-4 (58.1%) showed comparable leading\naccuracies (p=.93) significantly exceeding their counterparts (p<.001). All\nmodels struggled with retinal fundoscopy; Qwen2.5 and Gemma3 achieved the\nhighest, albeit modest, accuracies at 18.6% (comparable, p=.99), significantly\nbetter than other tested models (p<.001). Unexpectedly, multimodal input\nreduced accuracy for some models and modalities, and chain-of-thought reasoning\nprompts also failed to improve accuracy.

Unlike conventional image-based diffusion models that operate on\nstructured data representations, this framework enables direct processing of\nany data formats including meshes and point clouds while preserving geometric\nfidelity. We validate our approach across three distinct physical domains with\ncomplex geometric configurations: 2D spatio-temporal systems including cylinder\nfluid flow and OLED drop impact test, and 3D large-scale system for road-car\nexternal aerodynamics. To justify the necessity of our point-wise approach for\nreal-time prediction applications, we employ denoising diffusion implicit\nmodels (DDIM) for efficient deterministic sampling, requiring only 5-10 steps\ncompared to traditional 1000-step and providing computational speedup of 100 to\n200 times during inference without compromising accuracy. In addition, our\nproposed model achieves superior performance compared to image-based diffusion\nmodel: reducing training time by 94.4% and requiring 89.0% fewer parameters\nwhile achieving over 28% improvement in prediction accuracy. Comprehensive\ncomparisons against data-flexible surrogate models including DeepONet and\nMeshgraphnet demonstrate consistent superiority of our approach across all\nthree physical systems.

This is motivated by evidence\nthat, while MRI does not directly detect amyloid pathology, it may nonetheless\nencode information correlated with amyloid deposition that can be uncovered\nthrough advanced modeling. However, the high dimensionality and structural\ncomplexity of 3D neuroimaging data pose significant challenges for existing\nMRI-to-PET translation methods. Modeling the cross-modality relationship in a\nlower-dimensional latent space can simplify the learning task and enable more\neffective translation. As such, we present CoCoLIT (ControlNet-Conditioned\nLatent Image Translation), a diffusion-based latent generative framework that\nincorporates three main innovations: (1) a novel Weighted Image Space Loss\n(WISL) that improves latent representation learning and synthesis quality; (2)\na theoretical and empirical analysis of Latent Average Stabilization (LAS), an\nexisting technique used in similar generative models to enhance inference\nconsistency; and (3) the introduction of ControlNet-based conditioning for\nMRI-to-PET translation.

However, the field lacks comprehensive\nbenchmarks for evaluating multimodal learning methods that leverage both\nhistology images and gene expression data. Here, we present HESCAPE, a\nlarge-scale benchmark for cross-modal contrastive pretraining in spatial\ntranscriptomics, built on a curated pan-organ dataset spanning 6 different gene\npanels and 54 donors. We systematically evaluated state-of-the-art image and\ngene expression encoders across multiple pretraining strategies and assessed\ntheir effectiveness on two downstream tasks: gene mutation classification and\ngene expression prediction. Our benchmark demonstrates that gene expression\nencoders are the primary determinant of strong representational alignment, and\nthat gene models pretrained on spatial transcriptomics data outperform both\nthose trained without spatial data and simple baseline approaches. However,\ndownstream task evaluation reveals a striking contradiction: while contrastive\npretraining consistently improves gene mutation classification performance, it\ndegrades direct gene expression prediction compared to baseline encoders\ntrained without cross-modal objectives.

In this work, we address both\nsegmentation and pCR classification using the large-scale MAMA-MIA DCE-MRI\ndataset. We employ a large-kernel MedNeXt architecture with a two-stage\ntraining strategy that expands the receptive field from 3x3x3 to 5x5x5 kernels\nusing the UpKern algorithm. This approach allows stable transfer of learned\nfeatures to larger kernels, improving segmentation performance on the unseen\nvalidation set. An ensemble of large-kernel models achieved a Dice score of\n0.67 and a normalized Hausdorff Distance (NormHD) of 0.24. For pCR\nclassification, we trained a self-normalizing network (SNN) on radiomic\nfeatures extracted from the predicted segmentations and first post-contrast\nDCE-MRI, reaching an average balanced accuracy of 57\\%, and up to 75\\% in some\nsubgroups. Our findings highlight the benefits of combining larger receptive\nfields and radiomics-driven classification while motivating future work on\nadvanced ensembling and the integration of clinical variables to further\nimprove performance and generalization.

This limits\ntheir utility in embodied settings, which require reasoning over long frame\nsequences from a continuous stream of visual input at each moment of a task\nattempt. To address this limitation, we propose ROVER (Reasoning Over VidEo\nRecursively), a framework that enables the model to recursively decompose\nlong-horizon video trajectories into segments corresponding to shorter subtasks\nwithin the trajectory. In doing so, ROVER facilitates more focused and accurate\nreasoning over temporally localized frame sequences without losing global\ncontext. We evaluate ROVER, implemented using an in-context learning approach,\non diverse OpenX Embodiment videos and on a new dataset derived from RoboCasa\nthat consists of 543 videos showing both expert and perturbed non-expert\ntrajectories across 27 robotic manipulation tasks. ROVER outperforms strong\nbaselines across three video reasoning tasks: task progress estimation,\nframe-level natural language reasoning, and video question answering. We\nobserve that, by reducing the number of frames the model reasons over at each\ntimestep, ROVER mitigates hallucinations, especially during unexpected or\nnon-optimal moments of a trajectory. In addition, by enabling the\nimplementation of a subtask-specific sliding context window, ROVER's time\ncomplexity scales linearly with video length, an asymptotic improvement over\nbaselines.

In this scenario, the deepfake\nregions are usually only spanning a few frames, with the majority of the rest\nremaining identical to the original. To tackle this, we propose a Hierarchical\nBoundary Modeling Network (HBMNet), which includes three modules: an\nAudio-Visual Feature Encoder that extracts discriminative frame-level\nrepresentations, a Coarse Proposal Generator that predicts candidate boundary\nregions, and a Fine-grained Probabilities Generator that refines these\nproposals using bidirectional boundary-content probabilities. From the modality\nperspective, we enhance audio-visual learning through dedicated encoding and\nfusion, reinforced by frame-level supervision to boost discriminability. From\nthe temporal perspective, HBMNet integrates multi-scale cues and bidirectional\nboundary-content relationships.

It is especially challenging in\nconditions with sparse points and heavy noise. Traditional registration\nmethods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and Normal Distributions\nTransform (NDT), often have difficulties in achieving a robust and accurate\nalignment under these conditions. In this paper, we propose a registration\nframework based on moment matching. In particular, the point clouds are\nregarded as i.i.d. samples drawn from the same distribution observed in the\nsource and target frames. We then match the generalized Gaussian Radial Basis\nmoments calculated from the point clouds to estimate the rigid transformation\nbetween two frames. Moreover, such method does not require explicit\npoint-to-point correspondences among the point clouds. We further show the\nconsistency of the proposed method.

In this work,\nwe propose a simple yet effective approach for relaxing the symmetric\ncondition, namely $\\epsilon$-softmax, which simply modifies the outputs of the\nsoftmax layer to approximate one-hot vectors with a controllable error\n$\\epsilon$. Essentially, $\\epsilon$-softmax not only acts as an alternative for\nthe softmax layer, but also implicitly plays the crucial role in modifying the\nloss function.

Recognizing that $\\epsilon$-softmax-enhanced losses may slightly\nreduce fitting ability on clean datasets, we further incorporate them with one\nsymmetric loss, thereby achieving a better trade-off between robustness and\neffective learning.

In\ncontrast, immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides crucial insights into biomarker\nexpression, such as HER2 status for breast cancer grading, but remains costly\nand time-consuming, limiting its use in time-sensitive clinical workflows. To\naddress this gap, virtual staining from H&E to IHC has emerged as a promising\nalternative, yet faces two core challenges: (1) Lack of fair evaluation of\nsynthetic images against misaligned IHC ground truths, and (2) preserving\nstructural integrity and biological variability during translation.

We introduce Star-Diff, a structure-aware staining\nrestoration diffusion model that reformulates virtual staining as an image\nrestoration task. By combining residual and noise-based generation pathways,\nStar-Diff maintains tissue structure while modeling realistic biomarker\nvariability. To evaluate the diagnostic consistency of the generated IHC\npatches, we propose the Semantic Fidelity Score (SFS), a\nclinical-grading-task-driven metric that quantifies class-wise semantic\ndegradation based on biomarker classification accuracy.
