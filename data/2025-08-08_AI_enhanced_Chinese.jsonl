Traditional methods, such as\nextreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency\ndomain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible\ninformation loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure\nfrequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image\nartifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these\nlimitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework\ndesigned for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary\nsub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination\nAdaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,\nutilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,\nwhich effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the\nother hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination\ndistortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global\ncontext provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely\nderaining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows\nthat it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

Recently, diffusion models have emerged\nas a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and\nVAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on\nnormal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a\npredefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The\ncorresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse\nsampling.\n  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)\nthe reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple\nsampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or\nsubtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal\npattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate\nintermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and\noften assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in\nunsupervised settings.\n  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based\ndiffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of\nreconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that\nreconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the\ndiffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational\nefficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the\nMVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and\nstatistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,\nprecision, recall, and F1 score.

This task is realized by representing the\nimage as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a\ndeep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.\nDespite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly\nill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive\ntextures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the\nlow-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in\ntheir high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the\nASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this\nenhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original\norientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the\ninput image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation\nequivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign\nthe basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic\nrotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.\nThrough such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be\nimplemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to\noutput.

Furthermore, we also provide\ntheoretical analysis to support our method, including the generalization bound\nof graph-based DA and the role of spectral alignment and smoothing consistency.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPA++ consistently\noutperforms existing cutting-edge methods, achieving superior robustness and\nadaptability across various challenging adaptation scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPA++\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff08DA\uff09\u7684\u56fe\u8c31\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u90bb\u5c45\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u57df\u5185\u7ed3\u6784\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u8c31\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3001\u90bb\u5c45\u611f\u77e5\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SPA++\u901a\u8fc7\u8c31\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a\ngeneralizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data\npre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a\ntwo-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual\ninteraction blocks for robust correspondence learning.

The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges\nin training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes,\ndistribution shifts, and error imbalance.

However, its performance significantly degrades when\ndomain discrepancies exist between training and deployment. Cross-Domain\nFew-Shot Segmentation(CD-FSS) is proposed to mitigate such performance\ndegradation. Current CD-FSS methods primarily sought to develop segmentation\nmodels on a source domain capable of cross-domain generalization. However,\ndriven by escalating concerns over data privacy and the imperative to minimize\ndata transfer and training expenses, the development of source-free CD-FSS\napproaches has become essential. In this work, we propose a source-free CD-FSS\nmethod that leverages both textual and visual information to facilitate target\ndomain task adaptation without requiring source domain data. Specifically, we\nfirst append Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) to the feature pyramid of\na pretrained backbone, which adapt multi-level features extracted from the\nshared pre-trained backbone to the target task. Then, the parameters of the\nTSAA are trained through a Visual-Visual Embedding Alignment (VVEA) module and\na Text-Visual Embedding Alignment (TVEA) module. The VVEA module utilizes\nglobal-local visual features to align image features across different views,\nwhile the TVEA module leverages textual priors from pre-aligned multi-modal\nfeatures (e.g., from CLIP) to guide cross-modal adaptation.

Existing works\neither directly fuse the fixed language with vision features or simply modify\nusing attention, however, their performance is still limited. Recently, some\nresearchers have explored using text generation to adapt to the variations in\nthe target during tracking, however, these works fail to provide insights into\nthe model's reasoning process and do not fully leverage the advantages of large\nmodels, which further limits their overall performance. To address the\naforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel reasoning-based\nvision-language tracking framework, named ReasoningTrack, based on a\npre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL. Both SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)\nand reinforcement learning GRPO are used for the optimization of reasoning and\nlanguage generation. We embed the updated language descriptions and feed them\ninto a unified tracking backbone network together with vision features. Then,\nwe adopt a tracking head to predict the specific location of the target object.\nIn addition, we propose a large-scale long-term vision-language tracking\nbenchmark dataset, termed TNLLT, which contains 200 video sequences. 20\nbaseline visual trackers are re-trained and evaluated on this dataset, which\nbuilds a solid foundation for the vision-language visual tracking task.\nExtensive experiments on multiple vision-language tracking benchmark datasets\nfully validated the effectiveness of our proposed reasoning-based natural\nlanguage generation strategy.

To address these issues, this paper proposes\nSGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model\n(SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core\nof our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as\nexplicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a\nconditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a\ntwo-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal\nfeatures, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the\npreliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's\ncoarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only\nhas explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of\nthe final result.

Despite the remarkable progress of\ndeep learning in recent years, most existing methods still rely on\nspatial-domain modeling, where the limited diversity of feature representations\nhinders the detection of subtle change regions. We observe that\nfrequency-domain feature modeling particularly in the wavelet domain an amplify\nfine-grained differences in frequency components, enhancing the perception of\nedge changes that are challenging to capture in the spatial domain. Thus, we\npropose a method called Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF).\nSpecifically, we first apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the\ninput images into high-frequency and low-frequency components, which are used\nto model local details and global structures, respectively. In the\nhigh-frequency branch, we design a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE)\nmodule to strengthen edge detail representation and introduce a\nFrequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module to enhance the modeling\nof fine-grained changes. In the low-frequency branch, we exploit Transformers\nto capture global semantic relationships and employ a Progressive Contextual\nDifference Module (PCDM) to progressively refine change regions, enabling\nprecise structural semantic characterization. Finally, the high- and\nlow-frequency features are synergistically fused to unify local sensitivity\nwith global discriminability. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing\ndatasets demonstrate that WGDF significantly alleviates edge ambiguity and\nachieves superior detection accuracy and robustness compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Specifically, through sketches with the theme of \"a person picking an\napple from a tree (PPAT)\", it can be revealed whether the participants are in\nmental states such as depression. Compared with scales, the DPT can enrich\npsychologists' understanding of an individual's mental state. However, the\ninterpretation of the PPAT is laborious and depends on the experience of the\npsychologists. To address this issue, we propose an effective identification\nmethod to support psychologists in conducting a large-scale automatic DPT.\nUnlike traditional sketch recognition, DPT more focus on the overall evaluation\nof the sketches, such as color usage and space utilization. Moreover, PPAT\nimposes a time limit and prohibits verbal reminders, resulting in low drawing\naccuracy and a lack of detailed depiction.

Through rigorous evaluation across\nmultiple attack scenarios, we demonstrate that compression models capable of\nproducing realistic, high-fidelity reconstructions are substantially more\nresistant to our attacks.

However, the\nexisting tokenizers often face unsatisfactory trade-off between compression\nratios and reconstruction fidelity. To fill this gap, we introduce a powerful\nand concise WeTok tokenizer, which surpasses the previous leading tokenizers\nvia two core innovations. (1) Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ). We\npartition the latent features into groups, and perform lookup-free quantization\nfor each group. As a result, GQ can efficiently overcome memory and computation\nlimitations of prior tokenizers, while achieving a reconstruction breakthrough\nwith more scalable codebooks. (2) Generative Decoding (GD). Different from\nprior tokenizers, we introduce a generative decoder with a prior of extra noise\nvariable. In this case, GD can probabilistically model the distribution of\nvisual data conditioned on discrete tokens, allowing WeTok to reconstruct\nvisual details, especially at high compression ratios.

However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains\nchallenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to\nsupport reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited\ncapacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories\ncaused by fragmented architectures.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought\nframework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a\nsingle unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image\nunderstanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving\nvisual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is\nnon-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To\naddress this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A\nMacro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask\nexecution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.\nFurthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines\ninterleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task\nobjectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to\nperform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our\ndesign, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs\nwith 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation\nbenchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT\ndemonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT\nas a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning.

Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive\nperformance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and\nYouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated\nobjects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS\ntoward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1)\nwas introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the\nstrengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more\nchallenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world\nconditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks\nfor 10,074 objects across 200 categories.

Project page: https://weiqi-zhang.github.io/GAP", "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its advantages in achieving\nfast and high-quality rendering. As point clouds serve as a widely-used and\neasily accessible form of 3D representation, bridging the gap between point\nclouds and Gaussians becomes increasingly important. Recent studies have\nexplored how to convert the colored points into Gaussians, but directly\ngenerating Gaussians from colorless 3D point clouds remains an unsolved\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes\nraw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key\nidea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a\ndepth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across\ndifferent viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a\nsurface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the\nsurfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a\ndiffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing\nhard-to-observe regions. We evaluate GAP on the Point-to-Gaussian generation\ntask across varying complexity levels, from synthetic point clouds to\nchallenging real-world scans, and even large-scale scenes.

Achieving high-quality\nresults is challenging due to the large variability of clothed body especially\nin the generation of realistic wrinkles. 3D scan acquisitions provide more\naccuracy in the representation of real-world objects but lack semantic\ninformation that can be inferred with a reliable semantic reconstruction\npipeline. To this aim, shape segmentation plays a crucial role in identifying\nthe semantic shape parts. However, current 3D shape segmentation methods are\ndesigned for scene understanding and interpretation and only few work is\ndevoted to modeling. In the context of clothed body modeling the segmentation\nis a preliminary step for fully semantic shape parts reconstruction namely the\nunderlying body and the involved garments. These parts represent several layers\nwith strong overlap in contrast with standard segmentation methods that provide\ndisjoint sets. In this work we propose a new 3D point cloud segmentation\nparadigm where each 3D point can be simultaneously associated to different\nlayers. In this fashion we can estimate the underlying body parts and the\nunseen clothed regions, i.e., the part of a cloth occluded by the clothed-layer\nabove.

However,\nVFL typically faces two key challenges: i) the requirement for perfectly\naligned data samples across all clients (missing features are not allowed); ii)\nthe requirement for joint collaborative inference/prediction involving all\nclients (it does not support locally independent inference on a single client).\nTo address these challenges, we propose X-VFL, a new VFL framework designed to\ndeal with the non-aligned data samples with (partially) missing features and to\nsupport locally independent inference of new data samples for each client. In\nparticular, we design two novel modules in X-VFL: Cross Completion (XCom) and\nDecision Subspace Alignment (DS-Align). XCom can complete/reconstruct missing\nfeatures for non-aligned data samples by leveraging information from other\nclients. DS-Align aligns local features with completed and global features\nacross all clients within the decision subspace, thus enabling locally\nindependent inference at each client. Moreover, we provide convergence theorems\nfor different algorithms used in training X-VFL, showing an $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$\nconvergence rate for SGD-type algorithms and an $O(1/T)$ rate for PAGE-type\nalgorithms, where $T$ denotes the number of training update steps. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that X-VFL significantly\noutperforms existing methods, e.g., achieving a 15% improvement in accuracy on\nthe image CIFAR-10 dataset and a 43% improvement on the medical MIMIC-III\ndataset.

Built upon this foundation, GE-Act maps latent\nrepresentations to executable action trajectories through a lightweight,\nflow-matching decoder, enabling precise and generalizable policy inference\nacross diverse embodiments with minimal supervision. To support scalable\nevaluation and training, GE-Sim serves as an action-conditioned neural\nsimulator, producing high-fidelity rollouts for closed-loop policy development.\nThe platform is further equipped with EWMBench, a standardized benchmark suite\nmeasuring visual fidelity, physical consistency, and instruction-action\nalignment. Together, these components establish Genie Envisioner as a scalable\nand practical foundation for instruction-driven, general-purpose embodied\nintelligence. All code, models, and benchmarks will be released publicly.", "AI": {"tldr": "Genie Envisioner (GE) \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u667a\u80fd\u3002", "method": "GE-Base \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0cGE-Act \u5c06\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0cGE-Sim \u4f5c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4eff\u771f\u3002", "result": "\u5e73\u53f0\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u901a\u7528\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u57fa\u51c6 EWMBench\u3002", "conclusion": "Genie Envisioner \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u667a\u80fd\u57fa\u7840\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u516c\u5f00\u3002"}}
