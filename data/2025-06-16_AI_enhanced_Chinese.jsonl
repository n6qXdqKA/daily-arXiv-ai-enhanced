However, expressive and\nrealistic human animation remains challenging due to the trade-off between\nmotion naturalness and visual fidelity. To address this, we propose\n\\textbf{AlignHuman}, a framework that combines Preference Optimization as a\npost-training technique with a divide-and-conquer training strategy to jointly\noptimize these competing objectives. Our key insight stems from an analysis of\nthe denoising process across timesteps: (1) early denoising timesteps primarily\ncontrol motion dynamics, while (2) fidelity and human structure can be\neffectively managed by later timesteps, even if early steps are skipped.\nBuilding on this observation, we propose timestep-segment preference\noptimization (TPO) and introduce two specialized LoRAs as expert alignment\nmodules, each targeting a specific dimension in its corresponding timestep\ninterval. The LoRAs are trained using their respective preference data and\nactivated in the corresponding intervals during inference to enhance motion\nnaturalness and fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignHuman\nimproves strong baselines and reduces NFEs during inference, achieving a\n3.3$\\times$ speedup (from 100 NFEs to 30 NFEs) with minimal impact on\ngeneration quality.

However, existing UDA studies are based on natural\nimages or clear UAV imagery, and research focused on UAV imagery in adverse\nconditions is still in its infancy. Moreover, due to the unique perspective of\nUAVs and the interference from adverse conditions, these methods often fail to\naccurately align features and are influenced by limited or noisy pseudo-labels.\nTo address this, we propose the first benchmark for UAV object detection in\nadverse scenes, the Statistical Feedback-Driven Threshold and Mask Adjustment\nTeacher-Student Framework (SF-TMAT). Specifically, SF-TMAT introduces a design\ncalled Dynamic Step Feedback Mask Adjustment Autoencoder (DSFMA), which\ndynamically adjusts the mask ratio and reconstructs feature maps by integrating\ntraining progress and loss feedback. This approach dynamically adjusts the\nlearning focus at different training stages to meet the model's needs for\nlearning features at varying levels of granularity. Additionally, we propose a\nunique Variance Feedback Smoothing Threshold (VFST) strategy, which\nstatistically computes the mean confidence of each class and dynamically\nadjusts the selection threshold by incorporating a variance penalty term. This\nstrategy improves the quality of pseudo-labels and uncovers potentially valid\nlabels, thus mitigating domain bias.

Recent model-aware deep subspace clustering\nmethods often use a two-stage framework, involving the calculation of a\nself-representation matrix with complexity of O(n^2), followed by spectral\nclustering. However, these methods are computationally intensive, generally\nincorporating solely either local or non-local spatial structure constraints,\nand their structural constraints fall short of effectively supervising the\nentire clustering process.\n  We propose a scalable, context-preserving deep clustering method based on\nbasis representation, which jointly captures local and non-local structures for\nefficient HSI clustering. To preserve local structure (i.e., spatial continuity\nwithin subspaces), we introduce a spatial smoothness constraint that aligns\nclustering predictions with their spatially filtered versions. For non-local\nstructure (i.e., spectral continuity), we employ a mini-cluster-based scheme\nthat refines predictions at the group level, encouraging spectrally similar\npixels to belong to the same subspace. Notably, these two constraints are\njointly optimized to reinforce each other.\n  Specifically, our model is designed as an one-stage approach in which the\nstructural constraints are applied to the entire clustering process. The time\nand space complexity of our method is O(n), making it applicable to large-scale\nHSI data. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art techniques.

Inspired by real-world practices, we provide these cues through a\nlarge-scale database of uncurated images. To address this new task, we propose\na novel framework that jointly understands spatial environments and detects\nchanges.

While these methods achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance across benchmarks, much of the improvement stems from base\npseudo-labels (CLIP zero-shot predictions) and self-training mechanisms. Thus,\nthe training mechanism exhibits a key limitation wherein the visual embedding\ndistribution in target domains can deviate from the visual embedding\ndistribution in the pre-trained model, leading to misguided signals from class\ndescriptions. This work introduces a fresh solution to reinforce these\npseudo-labels and facilitate target-prompt learning, by exploiting the geometry\nof visual and text embeddings - an aspect that is overlooked by existing\nmethods. We first propose to directly leverage the reference predictions (from\nsource prompts) based on the relationship between source and target visual\nembeddings.

However, achieving realistic and naturalistic generation\nremains a significant challenge due to the complexity of sign language, which\nencompasses intricate hand gestures, facial expressions, and body movements. In\nthis work, we introduce PHOENIX14T+, an extended version of the widely-used\nRWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset, featuring three new sign representations:\nPose, Hamer and Smplerx. We also propose a novel method, SignAligner, for\nrealistic sign language generation, consisting of three stages: text-driven\npose modalities co-generation, online collaborative correction of\nmultimodality, and realistic sign video synthesis. First, by incorporating text\nsemantics, we design a joint sign language generator to simultaneously produce\nposture coordinates, gesture actions, and body movements. The text encoder,\nbased on a Transformer architecture, extracts semantic features, while a\ncross-modal attention mechanism integrates these features to generate diverse\nsign language representations, ensuring accurate mapping and controlling the\ndiversity of modal features.

However, existing\nmodels suffer from several severe limitations. 1) neglecting the selection of\nnegative samples, resulting in the scarcity of hard negatives and the inclusion\nof false negatives; 2) focusing on global feature extraction, but overlooking\nthe fine-grained local details that are crucial for medical image recognition\ntasks; and 3) contrastive learning primarily targets high-level features but\nignoring low-level details which are essential for accurate medical analysis.\nMotivated by these critical issues, this paper presents a Cross-Modal\nCluster-Guided Negative Sampling (CM-CGNS) method with two-fold ideas. First,\nit extends the k-means clustering used for local text features in the\nsingle-modal domain to the multimodal domain through cross-modal attention.\nThis improvement increases the number of negative samples and boosts the model\nrepresentation capability. Second, it introduces a Cross-Modal Masked Image\nReconstruction (CM-MIR) module that leverages local text-to-image features\nobtained via cross-modal attention to reconstruct masked local image regions.\nThis module significantly strengthens the model's cross-modal information\ninteraction capabilities and retains low-level image features essential for\ndownstream tasks. By well handling the aforementioned limitations, the proposed\nCM-CGNS can learn effective and robust medical visual representations suitable\nfor various recognition tasks.

Due to their reliance on idealized\nassumptions of complete modality availability, existing methods fail to\ndynamically balance contributions and neglect the structural relationships\nbetween modalities, resulting in suboptimal performance in real-world clinical\nscenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model, named\nDynamic Modality-Aware Fusion Network (DMAF-Net). The DMAF-Net adopts three key\nideas. First, it introduces a Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion (DMAF) module to\nsuppress missing-modality interference by combining transformer attention with\nadaptive masking and weight modality contributions dynamically through\nattention maps. Second, it designs a synergistic Relation Distillation and\nPrototype Distillation framework to enforce global-local feature alignment via\ncovariance consistency and masked graph attention, while ensuring semantic\nconsistency through cross-modal class-specific prototype alignment. Third, it\npresents a Dynamic Training Monitoring (DTM) strategy to stabilize optimization\nunder imbalanced missing rates by tracking distillation gaps in real-time, and\nto balance convergence speeds across modalities by adaptively reweighting\nlosses and scaling gradients.

Specifically, the CLIP-based\ndiscriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the\ndiffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a\nsynergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for\nutilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models\nspecifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets\n(MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline\nmethods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and\nclassification.

Model quantization, particularly to low\nbit-widths like 4-bit, aims to alleviate this difficulty, yet existing\nPost-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods\nexhibit significant limitations. PTQ often incurs substantial accuracy drop,\nwhile QAT achieves high accuracy but suffers from prohibitive computational\ncosts, limited generalization to downstream tasks, training instability, and\nlacking of open-source codebase.

GPLQ is\nfounded on two key empirical insights: the paramount importance of activation\nquantization and the necessity of preserving the model's original optimization\n``basin'' to maintain generalization. Consequently, GPLQ employs a sequential\n``activation-first, weights-later'' strategy. Stage 1 keeps weights in FP32\nwhile quantizing activations with a feature mimicking loss in only 1 epoch to\nkeep it stay in the same ``basin'', thereby preserving generalization. Stage 2\nquantizes weights using a PTQ method.

SAR ship images present challenges including scale\nvariation, object density, and fuzzy target boundary, which are often\noverlooked in existing methods, leading to suboptimal performance. In this\nwork, we propose O2Former, a tailored instance segmentation framework that\nextends Mask2Former by fully leveraging the structural characteristics of SAR\nimagery. We introduce two key components. The first is the Optimized Query\nGenerator(OQG). It enables multi-scale feature interaction by jointly encoding\nshallow positional cues and high-level semantic information. This improves\nquery quality and convergence efficiency. The second component is the\nOrientation-Aware Embedding Module(OAEM). It enhances directional sensitivity\nthrough direction-aware convolution and polar-coordinate encoding. This\neffectively addresses the challenge of uneven target orientations in SAR\nscenes. Together, these modules facilitate precise feature alignment from\nbackbone to decoder and strengthen the model's capacity to capture fine-grained\nstructural details.

This design is fundamental\nto our approach: by keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains\nits original language representations without adaptation to visual data.\nConsequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the\nLLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model\nto develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning.

However, this model has not been\nused in deep learning before, partly due to the challenge of incorporating\ndiscrete set operations. We develop a differentiable parameterization of\nTversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive\nneural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which\nunlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR.\nThrough experiments with image recognition and language modeling, we show that\nthe Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear\nprojection layer, which employs geometric similarity. On the NABirds image\nclassification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer\nachieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter\nbaseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases\nby 7.5%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified\ninterpretation of both projection layers as computing similarities of input\nstimuli to learned prototypes, for which we also propose a novel visualization\ntechnique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers.

Stage\n1: an asymmetric U-Net with cancelled high-frequency skips predicts a\nquarter-scale phase map from the interferogram, capturing reliable\nlow-frequency structure while avoiding spectral bias. Stage 2: the upsampled\nprediction, lightly perturbed with Gaussian noise, is refined by an\nunconditional diffusion model that iteratively recovers the missing\nhigh-frequency residuals through reverse denoising. Experiments on four QPI\ndatasets (B-Cell, WBC, HeLa, 3T3) show that DiffPR outperforms strong U-Net\nbaselines, boosting PSNR by up to 1.1 dB and reducing MAE by 11 percent, while\ndelivering markedly sharper membrane ridges and speckle patterns. The results\ndemonstrate that cancelling high-level skips and delegating detail synthesis to\na diffusion prior is an effective remedy for the spectral bias that limits\nconventional phase-retrieval networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faDiffPR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u9ad8\u9891\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5b9a\u91cf\u76f8\u4f4d\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9a\u91cf\u76f8\u4f4d\u6210\u50cf\uff08QPI\uff09\u4e22\u5931\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfU-Net\u56e0\u9891\u8c31\u504f\u5dee\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6DiffPR\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u53d6\u6d88\u9ad8\u9891\u8df3\u8dc3\u7684U-Net\u9884\u6d4b\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u76f8\u4f4d\u56fe\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6062\u590d\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2aQPI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDiffPR\u6bd4U-Net\u57fa\u7ebfPSNR\u63d0\u53471.1 dB\uff0cMAE\u964d\u4f4e11%\uff0c\u7ec6\u8282\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6d88\u9664\u9ad8\u9891\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u9891\u8c31\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

But by utilizing their sensory cues, humans still outperform\nmachines, especially in micro scale manufacturing, which requires\nhigh-precision robot manipulators. These sensory cues naturally compensate for\nhigh levels of uncertainties that exist in the manufacturing environment.\nUncertainties in performing manufacturing tasks may come from measurement\nnoise, model inaccuracy, joint compliance (e.g., elasticity), etc. Although\nadvanced metrology sensors and high precision microprocessors, which are\nutilized in modern robots, have compensated for many structural and dynamic\nerrors in robot positioning, a well-designed control algorithm still works as a\ncomparable and cheaper alternative to reduce uncertainties in automated\nmanufacturing. Our work illustrates that a multi-robot control system that\nsimulates the positioning process for fastening and unfastening applications\ncan reduce various uncertainties, which may occur in this process, to a great\nextent.

Methods: We propose the\nFrequency-Domain Attention-Guided Diffusion Network (FAD-Net), which integrates\na frequency-domain-based attention mechanism and a cascading diffusion strategy\nto fully exploit frequency-domain information for improved segmentation\naccuracy.

Furthermore, a\nLow-Frequency Diffusion Module (LFDM) is incorporated to decompose ICAs into\nlow- and high-frequency components via multi-level wavelet transformation.\nSubsequently, it refines fine-grained arterial branches and edges by\nreintegrating high-frequency details via inverse fusion, enabling continuous\nenhancement of anatomical precision.

In\ncontrast to widely used English-language benchmarks that often rely on\nartificially difficult or decontextualized problems, this dataset draws from\nreal middle school curricula across nine domains including mathematics,\nhistory, biology, and religion. The benchmark includes over 2,000 open-ended\nquestions grounded in 486 images, ensuring that models must integrate visual\ninterpretation with factual reasoning rather than rely on superficial textual\ncues. We evaluate thirteen state-of-the-art open-weight VLMs across multiple\ndimensions, including domain-specific accuracy and performance on adversarial\ncrafted questions. Our findings reveal that even the strongest models achieve\nless than 45% overall accuracy, with particularly poor performance in music,\nmathematics, and adversarial settings.

However, these methods are typically implemented by stacking\ndeeper networks or leveraging transformer-based attention mechanisms, which\nconsequently increases model complexity. In contrast, model-driven methods\nbased on the unfolding paradigm show promise in improving performance while\neffectively maintaining model compactness through sophisticated module design.\nBased on these insights, we propose a Structural Similarity-Inspired Unfolding\n(SSIU) method for efficient image SR. This method is designed through unfolding\nan SR optimization function constrained by structural similarity, aiming to\ncombine the strengths of both data-driven and model-driven approaches. Our\nmodel operates progressively following the unfolding paradigm. Each iteration\nconsists of multiple Mixed-Scale Gating Modules (MSGM) and an Efficient Sparse\nAttention Module (ESAM). The former implements comprehensive constraints on\nfeatures, including a structural similarity constraint, while the latter aims\nto achieve sparse activation. In addition, we design a Mixture-of-Experts-based\nFeature Selector (MoE-FS) that fully utilizes multi-level feature information\nby combining features from different steps. Extensive experiments validate the\nefficacy and efficiency of our unfolding-inspired network.

The task is an extreme example of domain shift chosen\nto serve as a meaningful and illustrative benchmark. From a clinical\napplication perspective, it aims to automate Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) and\ncochlea segmentation on T2 scans for more cost-effective VS management. Over\ntime, the challenge objectives have evolved to enhance its clinical relevance.\nThe challenge evolved from using single-institutional data and basic\nsegmentation in 2021 to incorporating multi-institutional data and Koos grading\nin 2022, and by 2023, it included heterogeneous routine data and\nsub-segmentation of intra- and extra-meatal tumour components. In this work, we\nreport the findings of the 2022 and 2023 editions and perform a retrospective\nanalysis of the challenge progression over the years. The observations from the\nsuccessive challenge contributions indicate that the number of outliers\ndecreases with an expanding dataset. This is notable since the diversity of\nscanning protocols of the datasets concurrently increased. The winning approach\nof the 2023 edition reduced the number of outliers on the 2021 and 2022 testing\ndata, demonstrating how increased data heterogeneity can enhance segmentation\nperformance even on homogeneous data. However, the cochlea Dice score declined\nin 2023, likely due to the added complexity from tumour sub-annotations\naffecting overall segmentation performance.
