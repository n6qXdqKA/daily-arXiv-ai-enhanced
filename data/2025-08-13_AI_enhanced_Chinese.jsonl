In this paper, we propose\nan Image-enhanced molecular motif sequence representation framework for\n\\textbf{DDI} prediction, called ImageDDI, which represents a pair of drugs from\nboth global and local structures. Specifically, ImageDDI tokenizes molecules\ninto functional motifs. To effectively represent a drug pair, their motifs are\ncombined into a single sequence and embedded using a transformer-based encoder,\nstarting from the local structure representation. By leveraging the\nassociations between drug pairs, ImageDDI further enhances the spatial\nrepresentation of molecules using global molecular image information (e.g.\ntexture, shadow, color, and planar spatial relationships). To integrate\nmolecular visual information into functional motif sequence, ImageDDI employs\nAdaptive Feature Fusion, enhancing the generalization of ImageDDI by\ndynamically adapting the fusion process of feature representations.\nExperimental results on widely used datasets demonstrate that ImageDDI\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods.

We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines\nfine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and\nretrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these\nlimitations.\n  Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual\nelements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii)\ncomprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct\ninference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity\nanalysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint\nrepresentations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters\nwith 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form\nnarrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative\nstorytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning.

Although DETR-based methods have\nrecently emerged as the mainstream framework for HOI detection, they still\nsuffer from a key limitation: Randomly initialized queries lack explicit\nsemantics, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this\nchallenge, we propose QueryCraft, a novel plug-and-play HOI detection framework\nthat incorporates semantic priors and guided feature learning through\ntransformer-based query initialization. Central to our approach is\n\\textbf{ACTOR} (\\textbf{A}ction-aware \\textbf{C}ross-modal\n\\textbf{T}ransf\\textbf{OR}mer), a cross-modal Transformer encoder that jointly\nattends to visual regions and textual prompts to extract action-relevant\nfeatures.

AAA-level Simulation: We design\na highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based\nshift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS\ninteractive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical\nautoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into\nopen-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the\nVDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive\nvideo generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from\ndifferent domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to\nblend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to\nuser prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that\nexplicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering,\nenabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through\ntext. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing\ninteractive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a\ncomprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the\nnext generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment.

As these\nmodels grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the\nneed to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance\n'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited\ntransferability across models due to their model-specific design and high\ncomputational demands.

However, ultrasound deformable registration\nremains highly challenging, especially under large deformation. The inherently\nlow contrast, heavy noise and ambiguous tissue boundaries in ultrasound images\nseverely hinder reliable feature extraction and correspondence matching.\nExisting methods often suffer from poor anatomical alignment and lack physical\ninterpretability. To address the problem, we propose PADReg, a physics-aware\ndeformable registration framework guided by contact force.

Existing deep segmentation\nnetworks typically weight all pixels equally under cross-entropy (CE) loss,\noverlooking the fact that sub-regions of lens structures are inhomogeneous\n(e.g., some regions perform better than others) and that boundary regions often\nsuffer from poor segmentation calibration at the pixel level. Clinically,\nexperts annotate different sub-regions of lens structures with varying\nconfidence levels, considering factors such as sub-region proportions,\nambiguous boundaries, and lens structure shapes. Motivated by this observation,\nwe propose an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss to group each lens structure\nsub-region into different confidence sub-regions via a confidence threshold\nfrom the unique region aspect, aiming to exploit the potential of expert\nannotation confidence prior. Specifically, ACW clusters each target region into\nlow-confidence and high-confidence groups and then applies a region-weighted\nloss to reweigh each confidence group.

Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation\nis more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex\nbody structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce\nDiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose\nestimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal\nreformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative\nframework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint\ngeneration, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global\nanatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific\nprompts.

The reliance on\nsuch conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs,\nand challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity\npreservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face\nrecognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would\nbe preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to\nsynthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a\nsimple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature\nselection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems,\nwe empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2\nlatent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while\npreserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for\nestimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity\npreservation for a given input face.

In this work, we identify two key issues behind these failures: (1)\ntoken-wise interference among different LoRA modules, and (2) spatial\nmisalignment between the attention map of a rare token and its corresponding\nconcept-specific region. To address these issues, we propose Token-Aware LoRA\n(TARA), which introduces a token mask to explicitly constrain each module to\nfocus on its associated rare token to avoid interference, and a training\nobjective that encourages the spatial attention of a rare token to align with\nits concept region. Our method enables training-free multi-concept composition\nby directly injecting multiple independently trained TARA modules at inference\ntime. Experimental results demonstrate that TARA enables efficient\nmulti-concept inference and effectively preserving the visual identity of each\nconcept by avoiding mutual interference between LoRA modules.

Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality data in this field\nmakes it difficult to precisely control storytelling tasks, including the\nsubject's position, appearance, clothing, expression, and posture, thereby\nhindering further advancements. In this paper, we demonstrate that layout\nconditions, such as the subject's position and detailed attributes, effectively\nfacilitate fine-grained interactions between frames.

In this context, color recommendation involves\nsuggesting appropriate colors to complete or refine a design when one or more\ncolors are missing or require alteration. Traditional methods often struggled\nwith these challenges due to the complex nature of color design and the limited\ndata availability. In this study, we explored the use of pretrained Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) and their commonsense reasoning capabilities for color\nrecommendation, raising the question: Can pretrained LLMs serve as superior\ndesigners for color recommendation tasks? To investigate this, we developed a\nrobust, rigorously validated pipeline, ColorGPT, that was built by\nsystematically testing multiple color representations and applying effective\nprompt engineering techniques. Our approach primarily targeted color palette\ncompletion by recommending colors based on a set of given colors and\naccompanying context.

Despite\nadvancements in video comprehension, the substantial computational demands of\nlong video sequences lead current video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to employ compression\nstrategies at both the inter-frame level (e.g., uniform sampling of video\nframes) and intra-frame level (e.g., condensing all visual tokens of each frame\ninto a limited number). However, this approach often neglects the uneven\ntemporal distribution of critical information across frames, risking the\nomission of keyframes that contain essential temporal and semantic details. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose KFFocus, a method designed to efficiently\ncompress video tokens and emphasize the informative context present within\nvideo frames.

These\nmethods decompose images into mutually independent illumination and reflectance\ncomponents, allows each component to be enhanced separately. In fact, achieving\nperfect decomposition of illumination and reflectance components proves to be\nquite challenging, with some residuals still existing after decomposition. In\nthis paper, we formally name these residuals as inter-component residuals\n(ICR), which has been largely underestimated by previous methods. In our\ninvestigation, ICR not only affects the accuracy of the decomposition but also\ncauses enhanced components to deviate from the ideal outcome, ultimately\nreducing the final synthesized image quality. To address this issue, we propose\na novel Inter-correction Retinex model (IRetinex) to alleviate ICR during the\ndecomposition and enhancement stage.

For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational\nAutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both\nlarge parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or\nextremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a\nlow-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile\ndevices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get\nempirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions\ninto our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We\nobserve that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly\nsuited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose\na decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building\nupon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3)\nWe propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is\nused during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the\nfull VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our\nknowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile\ndevices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video\nVAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as\nlow as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on\nGPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of\nthe original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs,\nTurbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on\nthe iPhone 16 Pro.

Semi-supervised\ndomain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,\nassuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but\nthe test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this\nstudy, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,\nMoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are\nhighly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts\nresulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,\ndomain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a\ndomain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.\nSubsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive\ncontrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final\nclassifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and\ndiscriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data\naugmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow\nbetween the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex\nrepresentations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA\nachieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various\nunlabeled ratios in the target domain data.

We remove the difficulties associated with identifying and\nretargeting the semantics of one rig framework to another by utilizing the same\nframework (3DMM, FLAME, MetaHuman, etc.) for both subjects. Although this does\nnot constrain the choice of framework when retargeting from one person to\nanother, it does force the tracker to use the game/VR character rig when\nretargeting to a game/VR character. We utilize volumetric morphing in order to\nfit facial rigs to both performers and targets; in addition, a carefully chosen\nset of Simon-Says expressions is used to calibrate each rig to the motion\nsignatures of the relevant performer or target. Although a uniform set of\nSimon-Says expressions can likely be used for all person to person retargeting,\nwe argue that person to game/VR character retargeting benefits from Simon-Says\nexpressions that capture the distinct motion signature of the game/VR character\nrig. The Simon-Says calibrated rigs tend to produce the desired expressions\nwhen exercising animation controls (as expected). Unfortunately, these\nwell-calibrated rigs still lead to undesirable controls when tracking a\nperformance (a well-behaved function can have an arbitrarily ill-conditioned\ninverse), even though they typically produce acceptable geometry\nreconstructions. Thus, we propose a fine-tuning approach that modifies the rig\nused by the tracker in order to promote the output of more semantically\nmeaningful animation controls, facilitating high efficacy retargeting.

Recent filtering methods often suffer\nfrom point clustering or noise retaining issues. In this paper, we propose\nHybrid Point Cloud Filtering ($\\textbf{HybridPF}$) that considers both\nshort-range and long-range filtering trajectories when removing noise. It is\nwell established that short range scores, given by $\\nabla_{x}\\log p(x_t)$, may\nprovide the necessary displacements to move noisy points to the underlying\nclean surface. By contrast, long range velocity flows approximate constant\ndisplacements directed from a high noise variant patch $x_0$ towards the\ncorresponding clean surface $x_1$. Here, noisy patches $x_t$ are viewed as\nintermediate states between the high noise variant and the clean patches. Our\nintuition is that long range information from velocity flow models can guide\nthe short range scores to align more closely with the clean points. In turn,\nscore models generally provide a quicker convergence to the clean surface.\nSpecifically, we devise two parallel modules, the ShortModule and LongModule,\neach consisting of an Encoder-Decoder pair to respectively account for\nshort-range scores and long-range flows. We find that short-range scores,\nguided by long-range features, yield filtered point clouds with good point\ndistributions and convergence near the clean surface. We design a joint loss\nfunction to simultaneously train the ShortModule and LongModule, in an\nend-to-end manner.

As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's\nability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective\nhuman-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass\nhuman experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI,\nparticularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely\nunexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs\nusing the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial\ncounterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.\nResults show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately\nidentifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing\nperformance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we\naggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence,\nhuman groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM\npredictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd.

We then\nuse our new proposed metrics to evaluate a range of state of the art frame\ninterpolation metrics and find our metrics tend to favour more perceptual\npleasing interpolated frames that may not score highly in terms of PSNR or\nSSIM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u5904\u7406\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u63d2\u503c\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\u53d1\u6563\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u5206\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u597d\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u63d2\u503c\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d1\u5c55\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d2\u503c\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u70b9\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5904\u7406\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\u53d1\u6563\u6027\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5728BVI-VFI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u597d\uff08PLCC=0.51\uff09\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u6bd4FloLPIPS\u9ad82.7\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u4e0a\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u63d2\u503c\u5e27\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\u53d1\u6563\u6027\u6307\u6807\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u63d2\u503c\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}
