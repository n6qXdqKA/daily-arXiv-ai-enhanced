However, this task is often challenging due to the diversity of scenes,\nlarge number of fine-grained objects, and complex free-form nature of language\nreferences. Furthermore, in the 3D domain, obtaining large amounts of natural\nlanguage training data is difficult. Thus, it is important for methods to learn\nfrom little data and zero-shot generalize to new environments. To address these\nchallenges, we propose SORT3D, an approach that utilizes rich object attributes\nfrom 2D data and merges a heuristics-based spatial reasoning toolbox with the\nability of large language models (LLMs) to perform sequential reasoning.\nImportantly, our method does not require text-to-3D data for training and can\nbe applied zero-shot to unseen environments. We show that SORT3D achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on complex view-dependent grounding tasks on two\nbenchmarks. We also implement the pipeline to run real-time on an autonomous\nvehicle and demonstrate that our approach can be used for object-goal\nnavigation on previously unseen real-world environments.

Specifically, OOD\ndetection refers to the detection of instances that do not belong to the\ntraining distribution, while still having good performance on the\nin-distribution task (e.g., classification or object detection). Recent work\nhas focused on generating synthetic outliers and using them to train an outlier\ndetector, generally achieving improved OOD detection than traditional OOD\nmethods. In this regard, outliers can be generated either in feature or pixel\nspace. Feature space driven methods have shown strong performance on both the\nclassification and object detection tasks, at the expense that the\nvisualization of training outliers remains unknown, making further analysis on\nOOD failure modes challenging.

However, capturing long sequences of actions performed\nin surgical settings poses challenges, as individual surgeons have their unique\napproaches shaped by their expertise, leading to significant variability. To\ntackle this complex problem, we focused on segmentation with precise\nboundaries, a demanding task due to the inherent variability in action\ndurations and the subtle transitions often observed in untrimmed videos. These\ntransitions, marked by ambiguous starting and ending points, complicate the\nsegmentation process. Traditional models, such as MS-TCN, which depend on large\nreceptive fields, frequently face challenges of over-segmentation (resulting in\nfragmented segments) or under-segmentation (merging distinct actions). Both of\nthese issues negatively impact the quality of segmentation. To overcome these\nchallenges, we present the Multi-Stage Boundary-Aware Transformer Network\n(MSBATN) with hierarchical sliding window attention, designed to enhance action\nsegmentation. Our proposed approach incorporates a novel unified loss function\nthat treats action classification and boundary detection as distinct yet\ninterdependent tasks.

These findings emerged from fully self-directed\nreasoning cycles that combined generative sequence design, high-accuracy\nstructure prediction and physics-aware property models, with paired\ngeneration-and-reflection agents enforcing self-correction and reproducibility.\nThe key result is that Sparks can independently conduct rigorous scientific\ninquiry and identify previously unknown scientific principles.", "AI": {"tldr": "Sparks\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u4ee3\u7406AI\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b8c\u6210\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u3001\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e24\u9879\u65b0\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u591a\u6570AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ec5\u80fd\u590d\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u800cSparks\u65e8\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u7c7b\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "method": "Sparks\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5e8f\u5217\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u5c5e\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210-\u53cd\u601d\u4ee3\u7406\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e24\u9879\u65b0\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u957f\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u529b\u5b66\u4ea4\u53c9\u548c\u94fe\u957f/\u4e8c\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u56fe\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u80bd\u529b\u5b66\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u548c\u03b2-\u6298\u53e0\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "Sparks\u80fd\u591f\u72ec\u7acb\u8fdb\u884c\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u63a2\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u539f\u7406\u3002"}}

Despite significant advancements, existing CF\ngeneration methods often struggle to balance proximity, diversity, and\nrobustness, limiting their real-world applicability. A widely adopted\nframework, Diverse Counterfactual Explanations (DiCE), emphasizes diversity but\nlacks robustness, making CF explanations sensitive to perturbations and domain\nconstraints. To address these challenges, we introduce DiCE-Extended, an\nenhanced CF explanation framework that integrates multi-objective optimization\ntechniques to improve robustness while maintaining interpretability. Our\napproach introduces a novel robustness metric based on the Dice-Sorensen\ncoefficient, ensuring stability under small input variations. Additionally, we\nrefine CF generation using weighted loss components (lambda_p, lambda_d,\nlambda_r) to balance proximity, diversity, and robustness. We empirically\nvalidate DiCE-Extended on benchmark datasets (COMPAS, Lending Club, German\nCredit, Adult Income) across multiple ML backends (Scikit-learn, PyTorch,\nTensorFlow).

Currently, limited attention has been given to the learning of visual\nuncertainty, which creates several issues in existing systems, including\ninconsistent visual quality and unreliable performance across different input\nconditions. To address the problem, we propose a Joint Uncertainty Learning\nNetwork (JULNet) for high-quality talking face video generation, which\nincorporates a representation of uncertainty that is directly related to visual\nerror. Specifically, we first design an uncertainty module to individually\npredict the error map and uncertainty map after obtaining the generated image.\nThe error map represents the difference between the generated image and the\nground truth image, while the uncertainty map is used to predict the\nprobability of incorrect estimates. Furthermore, to match the uncertainty\ndistribution with the error distribution through a KL divergence term, we\nintroduce a histogram technique to approximate the distributions.

The increasing\navailability of digital medical data, such as images, omics, biosignals, and\nelectronic health records, combined with advances in computing, has enabled AI\nmodels to approach expert-level performance. However, widespread clinical\nadoption remains limited, primarily due to challenges beyond technical\nperformance, including ethical concerns, regulatory barriers, and lack of\ntrust.

This design ensures the LB policy is invariant to the ordering of\nnodes (UE or cell), flexible in handling various network sizes, and capable of\naccounting for spatial node dependencies in LB decisions.

The adoption of sparse proposals streamlines the pipeline by\neliminating the need for proposal generators and post-processing for\noverlapping predictions. The proposed BAPs enrich object representation by\nintegrating ship and background features, allowing the model to learn their\ncontextual relationships for more accurate distinction of ships in complex\nenvironments. To complement BAPs, we propose Dual-Context Pooling (DCP), a\nnovel strategy that jointly extracts ship and background features in a single\nunified operation. This unified design improves efficiency by eliminating\nredundant computation inherent in separate pooling. Moreover, by ensuring that\nship and background features are pooled from the same feature map level, DCP\nprovides aligned features that improve contextual relationship learning.\nFinally, as a core component of contextual relationship learning in R-Sparse\nR-CNN, we design a dedicated transformer-based Interaction Module. This module\ninteracts pooled ship and background features with corresponding proposal\nfeatures and models their relationships. Experimental results show that\nR-Sparse R-CNN delivers outstanding accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art\nmodels by margins of up to 12.8% and 11.9% on SSDD and RSDD-SAR inshore\ndatasets, respectively.

This kernel scheme reduces the number of parameters with\nrespect to a fully connected neural network (NN). While CNN has proven to be an\neffective model in recognition of handwritten characters and traffic signal\nsign boards, etc. recently, its deep variants have proven to be effective in\nsimilar as well as more challenging applications like object, scene and action\nrecognition. Deep CNN add more layers and kernels to the classical CNN,\nincreasing the number of parameters, and partly reducing the main advantage of\nCNN which is less parameters. In this paper, a 3D pyramidal neural network\ncalled 3DPyraNet and a discriminative approach for spatio-temporal feature\nlearning based on it, called 3DPyraNet-F, are proposed. 3DPyraNet introduces a\nnew weighting scheme which learns features from both spatial and temporal\ndimensions analyzing multiple adjacent frames and keeping a biological\nplausible structure. It keeps the spatial topology of the input image and\npresents fewer parameters and lower computational and memory costs compared to\nboth fully connected NNs and recent deep CNNs. 3DPyraNet-F extract the features\nmaps of the highest layer of the learned network, fuse them in a single vector,\nand provide it as input in such a way to a linear-SVM classifier that enhances\nthe recognition of human actions and dynamic scenes from the videos.\nEncouraging results are reported with 3DPyraNet in real-world environments,\nespecially in the presence of camera induced motion. Further, 3DPyraNet-F\nclearly outperforms the state-of-the-art on three benchmark datasets and shows\ncomparable result for the fourth.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a3DPyraNet\u76843D\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f533DPyraNet-F\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u573a\u666f\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u53d8\u4f53\u867d\u7136\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u53c2\u6570\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u5931\u53bb\u4e86CNN\u53c2\u6570\u5c11\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53c8\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa3DPyraNet\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6848\u4ece\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u7a7a\u95f4\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b3DPyraNet-F\u63d0\u53d6\u6700\u9ad8\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u540e\u8f93\u5165\u7ebf\u6027SVM\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "result": "3DPyraNet\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff1b3DPyraNet-F\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7b2c\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "3DPyraNet\u548c3DPyraNet-F\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u573a\u666f\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this work, we consider a DTAP variant where every task is a\ncase composed of a stochastic sequence of activities. The DTAP, in this case,\ninvolves the decision of which employee to assign to which activity to process\nrequests as quickly as possible. In recent years, Deep Reinforcement Learning\n(DRL) has emerged as a promising tool for tackling this DTAP variant, but most\nresearch is limited to solving small-scale, synthetic problems, neglecting the\nchallenges posed by real-world use cases. To bridge this gap, this work\nproposes a DRL-based Decision Support System (DSS) for real-world scale DTAPS.\nTo this end, we introduce a DRL agent with two novel elements: a graph\nstructure for observations and actions that can effectively represent any DTAP\nand a reward function that is provably equivalent to the objective of\nminimizing the average cycle time of tasks.

Specifically, we first introduce a spatial-wise\nMulti-scale Cycle Selective Scan (MCSS) module and a Spectral-Wise\nSelf-Attention (SWSA) module, both with linear complexity, and combine them in\nparallel to form a basic Spatial-Spectral block (SS-block). Benefiting from the\nglobal receptive field of MCSS and SWSA, SS-block can effectively model the\ndegradation levels of different spatial regions and spectral bands, thereby\nenabling degradation level-based dual-domain adaptive UIE. By stacking multiple\nSS-blocks, we build our SS-UIE network. Additionally, a Frequency-Wise Loss\n(FWL) is introduced to narrow the frequency-wise discrepancy and reinforce the\nmodel's attention on the regions with high-frequency details. Extensive\nexperiments validate that the SS-UIE technique outperforms state-of-the-art UIE\nmethods while requiring cheaper computational and memory costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4-\u5149\u8c31\u53cc\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6c34\u4e0b\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5SS-UIE\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u57df\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u6ce2\u6bb5\u9000\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5f3a\u5316\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u6c34\u4e0b\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u57df\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u6ce2\u6bb5\u9000\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u533a\u57df\u5e73\u7b49\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u533a\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSS-UIE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u626b\u63cf\u6a21\u5757\uff08MCSS\uff09\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff08SWSA\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u7a7a\u95f4-\u5149\u8c31\u5757\uff08SS-block\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff08FWL\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSS-UIE\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SS-UIE\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9891\u7387\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6c34\u4e0b\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In this work, we\nexamine how such in-context retrieval operates within Transformer- and\nSSM-based language models. We find that both architectures develop the same\nfundamental Gather-and-Aggregate (G&A) mechanism. A Gather Head first\nidentifies and extracts relevant information from the context, which an\nAggregate Head then integrates into a final representation. Across both model\ntypes, G&A concentrates in just a few heads, making them critical bottlenecks\neven for benchmarks that require a basic form of retrieval. For example,\ndisabling a single Gather or Aggregate Head of a pruned Llama-3.1-8B degrades\nits ability to retrieve the correct answer letter in MMLU, reducing accuracy\nfrom 66% to 25%. This finding suggests that in-context retrieval can obscure\nthe limited knowledge demands of certain tasks. Despite strong MMLU performance\nwith retrieval intact, the pruned model fails on other knowledge tests. Similar\nG&A dependencies exist in GSM8K, BBH, and dialogue tasks. Given the\nsignificance of G&A in performance, we show that retrieval challenges in SSMs\nmanifest in how they implement G&A, leading to smoother attention patterns\nrather than the sharp token transitions that effective G&A relies on. Thus,\nwhile a gap exists between Transformers and SSMs in implementing in-context\nretrieval, it is confined to a few heads, not the entire model. This insight\nsuggests a unified explanation for performance differences between Transformers\nand SSMs while also highlighting ways to combine their strengths. For example,\nin pretrained hybrid models, attention components naturally take on the role of\nAggregate Heads.

Previous methods unify\npseudo-labels of cross-modality images through label association algorithms and\nthen design contrastive learning framework for global feature learning.\nHowever, these methods overlook the cross-modality variations in feature\nrepresentation and pseudo-label distributions brought by fine-grained patterns.\nThis insight results in insufficient modality-shared learning when only global\nfeatures are optimized. To address this issue, we propose a Semantic-Aligned\nLearning with Collaborative Refinement (SALCR) framework, which builds up\noptimization objective for specific fine-grained patterns emphasized by each\nmodality, thereby achieving complementary alignment between the label\ndistributions of different modalities. Specifically, we first introduce a Dual\nAssociation with Global Learning (DAGI) module to unify the pseudo-labels of\ncross-modality instances in a bi-directional manner. Afterward, a Fine-Grained\nSemantic-Aligned Learning (FGSAL) module is carried out to explore part-level\nsemantic-aligned patterns emphasized by each modality from cross-modality\ninstances. Optimization objective is then formulated based on the\nsemantic-aligned features and their corresponding label space. To alleviate the\nside-effects arising from noisy pseudo-labels, we propose a Global-Part\nCollaborative Refinement (GPCR) module to mine reliable positive sample sets\nfor the global and part features dynamically and optimize the inter-instance\nrelationships.

This paper addresses\na fundamental dilemma posed by AI decision-support systems: the risk of either\nbecoming overwhelmed by complex decisions, thus losing agency, or having\nautonomy compromised by externally controlled choice architectures reminiscent\nof ``nudging'' practices. While the ``nudge'' framework, based on the use of\nchoice-framing to guide individuals toward presumed beneficial outcomes,\ninitially appeared to preserve liberty, at AI-driven scale, it threatens to\nerode autonomy.

The increasing integration of large language models\n(LLMs) in computing education presents an emerging challenge in understanding\nhow students use LLMs and craft prompts to solve computational tasks.

We examine whether this approach can\nidentify patterns in prompt evolution, detect struggling students, and provide\ninsights into effective and ineffective strategies. Method. We introduce\nPrompt2Constraints, a novel method that translates students prompts into\nlogical constraints.

We find that while successful and unsuccessful attempts tend\nto use a similar number of constraints overall, when students fail, they often\nmodify their prompts more significantly, shifting problem-solving strategies\nmidway. We also identify points where specific interventions could be most\nhelpful to students for refining their prompts. Implications.

These scores are normalized to derive a weighted\naggregate attention score, effectively capturing the relative contributions of\nindividual heads. GMAR clarifies the role of each head in the prediction\nprocess, enabling more precise interpretability at the head level. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that GMAR consistently outperforms traditional attention\nrollout techniques. This work provides a practical contribution to\ntransformer-based architectures, establishing a robust framework for enhancing\nthe interpretability of Vision Transformer models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGMAR\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u9a71\u52a8\u91cf\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347ViT\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "ViT\u7684\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u867d\u7136\u5f3a\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165GMAR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u91cf\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5f97\u5230\u52a0\u6743\u805a\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eGMAR\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c55\u5f00\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u89e3\u91caViT\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "GMAR\u4e3aViT\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

For materials with\ncomplex microstructures, such as two-phase random materials (TRMs), material\nfailure is often accompanied by stress concentration. Phase interfaces in\ntwo-phase materials are critical for stress concentration. Therefore, the\nprediction error of stress at phase boundaries is crucial. In practical\nengineering, the pixels of the obtained material microstructure images are\nlimited, which limits the resolution of stress images generated by deep\nlearning methods, making it difficult to observe stress concentration regions.\nExisting Image Super-Resolution (ISR) technologies are all based on data-driven\nsupervised learning. However, stress images have natural physical constraints,\nwhich provide new ideas for new ISR technologies. In this study, we constructed\na stress prediction framework for TRMs. First, the framework uses a proposed\nMultiple Compositions U-net (MC U-net) to predict stress in low-resolution\nmaterial microstructures. By considering the phase interface information of the\nmicrostructure, the MC U-net effectively reduces the problem of excessive\nprediction errors at phase boundaries.

It provides\nan evidence-based view of where ChatGPT excels, where it fails, and how\nreliability varies by task, domain, and model version (GPT-3.5, GPT-4,\nGPT-4-turbo, GPT-4o).\n  Method: A Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) was conducted, gathering data\nfrom academic studies, reports, benchmarks, and grey literature up to 2025.\nFactual, reasoning, coding, and interpretive errors were considered. Data were\ngrouped by domain and SE phase and visualized using boxplots to show error\ndistributions.\n  Results: Error rates vary across domains and versions. In healthcare, rates\nranged from 8% to 83%. Business and economics saw error rates drop from ~50%\nwith GPT-3.5 to 15-20% with GPT-4. Engineering tasks averaged 20-30%.\nProgramming success reached 87.5%, though complex debugging still showed over\n50% errors. In SE, requirements and design phases showed lower error rates\n(~5-20%), while coding, testing, and maintenance phases had higher variability\n(10-50%).

We\nidentify the primary issue behind these low-quality renderings as a visibility\nmismatch between geometry and appearance, stemming from using these two\nmodalities together. To address this problem, we present CE-NPBG, a new\napproach for novel view synthesis (NVS) in large-scale autonomous driving\nscenes. Our method is a neural point-based technique that leverages two\nmodalities: posed images (cameras) and synchronized raw 3D point clouds\n(LiDAR). We first employ a connectivity relationship graph between appearance\nand geometry, which retrieves points from a large 3D point cloud map observed\nfrom the current camera perspective and uses them for rendering. By leveraging\nthis connectivity, our method significantly improves rendering quality and\nenhances run-time and scalability by using only a small subset of points from\nthe large 3D point cloud map. Our approach associates neural descriptors with\nthe points and uses them to synthesize views. To enhance the encoding of these\ndescriptors and elevate rendering quality, we propose a joint adversarial and\npoint rasterization training. During training, we pair an image-synthesizer\nnetwork with a multi-resolution discriminator. At inference, we decouple them\nand use the image-synthesizer to generate novel views.

VNFs are software-based\ncounterparts of traditional hardware devices that facilitate flexible and\nscalable service provisioning. Service Function Chains (SFCs), structured as\nordered sequences of VNFs, are pivotal in orchestrating complex network\nservices. Nevertheless, partitioning SFCs across multi-domain network\ninfrastructures presents substantial challenges due to stringent latency\nconstraints and limited resource availability. Conventional optimization-based\nmethods typically exhibit low scalability, whereas existing data-driven\napproaches often fail to adequately balance computational efficiency with the\ncapability to effectively account for dependencies inherent in SFCs. To\novercome these limitations, we introduce a Transformer-empowered actor-critic\nframework specifically designed for sequence-aware SFC partitioning. By\nutilizing the self-attention mechanism, our approach effectively models complex\ninter-dependencies among VNFs, facilitating coordinated and parallelized\ndecision-making processes.

However, existing methods usually train a\ndataset-specific deep network for each dataset. Due to the significant\ndifferences in the data distribution and labeling between various datasets, the\ntrained dataset-specific deep network has poor generalization performances on\nother datasets. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a change adapter\nnetwork (CANet) for a more universal and generalized CD. CANet contains\ndataset-shared and dataset-specific learning modules. The former explores the\ndiscriminative features of images, and the latter designs a lightweight adapter\nmodel, to deal with the characteristics of different datasets in data\ndistribution and labeling. The lightweight adapter can quickly generalize the\ndeep network for new CD tasks with a small computation cost. Specifically, this\npaper proposes an interesting change region mask (ICM) in the adapter, which\ncan adaptively focus on interested change objects and decrease the influence of\nlabeling differences in various datasets. Moreover, CANet adopts a unique batch\nnormalization layer for each dataset to deal with data distribution\ndifferences.

In the past, we have typically taken the target distribution as a\ncriterion to evaluate a model's compression performance. Nevertheless,it often\nremains challenging to precisely assess how well the model achieves compression\nand to compare the information content of the learned distribution with that of\nthe target distribution during compression,as the target distribution is\ntypically unknown and entropy computation often incurs exponential cost. In\nthis work, we explore these issues under a controlled experimental setup. We\nfind that Transformers exhibit a unique inductive bias in data compression:\nbeyond approaching the target distribution, they tend to favor learning\nlower-entropy distributions, with this tendency becoming more pronounced as the\nmodel size increases. This preference prevents Transformers from perfectly\naligning with the target distribution, instead further compressing its\ninformation content. Furthermore, we show that the FFN module plays a critical\nrole in driving this bias. In addition, while models remove informational\nredundancy from data during compression, they also exhibit redundancy within\ntheir parameters, which enables compression and can be characterized through\ndynamic sparsity. However, the dynamic sparsity patterns in Transformers,\nparticularly in attention and FFN modules, demand further exploration. As for\nthis, we show that larger Transformers show stronger preferences for bypassing\nattention computations via residual connections and have lower proportion of\nactive neurons.

Yet, the videos generated by recent works suffer from poor quality\nand spatiotemporal consistency, undermining their utility in advancing\nperception tasks under driving scenarios. To address this gap, we propose DiVE,\na diffusion transformer-based generative framework meticulously engineered to\nproduce high-fidelity, temporally coherent, and cross-view consistent\nmulti-view videos, aligning seamlessly with bird's-eye view layouts and textual\ndescriptions. DiVE leverages a unified cross-attention and a SketchFormer to\nexert precise control over multimodal data, while incorporating a view-inflated\nattention mechanism that adds no extra parameters, thereby guaranteeing\nconsistency across views.

While AI\nholds promise in supporting legal work, current datasets and models are\nnarrowly focused on isolated subtasks and fail to capture the end-to-end\ndecision-making required in real-world practice. To address this gap, we\nintroduce LawFlow, a dataset of complete end-to-end legal workflows collected\nfrom trained law students, grounded in real-world business entity formation\nscenarios.

HOIGaze\naddresses the challenging HOI setting by building on one key insight: The eye,\nhand, and head movements are closely coordinated during HOIs and this\ncoordination can be exploited to identify samples that are most useful for gaze\nestimator training - as such, effectively denoising the training data. This\ndenoising approach is in stark contrast to previous gaze estimation methods\nthat treated all training samples as equal. Specifically, we propose: 1) a\nnovel hierarchical framework that first recognises the hand currently visually\nattended to and then estimates gaze direction based on the attended hand; 2) a\nnew gaze estimator that uses cross-modal Transformers to fuse head and\nhand-object features extracted using a convolutional neural network and a\nspatio-temporal graph convolutional network; and 3) a novel eye-head\ncoordination loss that upgrades training samples belonging to the coordinated\neye-head movements.

As a remedy, we present an AnimateAnywhere framework, rousing\nthe background in human image animation without requirements on camera\ntrajectories.

A\nkey issue in minimizing the overall makespan of these pipelines is the\nefficient scheduling of concurrent queries within the pipelines.

The latest reinforcement\nlearning (RL) based methods have the potential to capture these patterns from\nfeedback, but it is non-trivial to apply them directly due to the large\nscheduling space, high sampling cost, and poor sample utilization.\n  Motivated by these challenges, we propose BQSched, a non-intrusive Scheduler\nfor Batch concurrent Queries via reinforcement learning. Specifically, BQSched\ndesigns an attention-based state representation to capture the complex query\npatterns, and proposes IQ-PPO, an auxiliary task-enhanced proximal policy\noptimization (PPO) algorithm, to fully exploit the rich signals of Individual\nQuery completion in logs. Based on the RL framework above, BQSched further\nintroduces three optimization strategies, including adaptive masking to prune\nthe action space, scheduling gain-based query clustering to deal with large\nquery sets, and an incremental simulator to reduce sampling cost. To our\nknowledge, BQSched is the first non-intrusive batch query scheduler via RL.\nExtensive experiments show that BQSched can significantly improve the\nefficiency and stability of batch query scheduling, while also achieving\nremarkable scalability and adaptability in both data and queries.

Images are rendered by interpolating\nsurrounding SH Texels at each pixel s sampling point using a novel\ninterpolation method. Conversely, gradients from each pixel are back-propagated\nto the related SH Texels in SH textures.

Our study bridges the 3D parsing capabilities of prior\nvisual foundation models with the powerful reasoning abilities of large\nlanguage models, opening new directions for 3D spatial reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "SpatialReasoner\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f3D\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u53473D\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u9690\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u672a\u5145\u5206\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u663e\u5f0f3D\u8868\u793a\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSpatialReasoner\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u54083D\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u663e\u5f0f3D\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f3D\u8868\u793a\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

To rigorously\nevaluate CODrone as a new benchmark and gain deeper insights into the novel\nchallenges it presents, we conduct a series of experiments based on 22\nclassical or SOTA methods.Our evaluation not only assesses the effectiveness of\nCODrone in real-world scenarios but also highlights key bottlenecks and\nopportunities to advance OOD in UAV applications.Overall, CODrone fills the\ndata gap in OOD from UAV perspective and provides a benchmark with enhanced\ngeneralization capability, better aligning with practical applications and\nfuture algorithm development.", "AI": {"tldr": "CODrone\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5b9a\u5411\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u57ce\u5e02\u3001\u591a\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6807\u6ce8\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5b9a\u5411\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u53cd\u6620\u5b9e\u9645\u98de\u884c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCODrone\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u56db\u5927\u9650\u5236\uff08\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u6709\u9650\u7c7b\u522b\u3001\u5355\u89c6\u89d2\u6210\u50cf\u3001\u53d7\u9650\u98de\u884c\u9ad8\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u57ce\u5e02\u3001\u591a\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6807\u6ce8\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u57fa\u4e8e22\u79cd\u7ecf\u5178\u6216SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1CODrone\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5b9a\u5411\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u548c\u673a\u9047\u3002", "conclusion": "CODrone\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u5b9a\u5411\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Even with state-of-the-art robot\nlearning methods, haptic-oblivious control strategies (i.e. those relying only\non external vision and/or proprioception) often fall short due to occlusions,\nvisual complexities, and the need for precise contact interaction control. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce PolyTouch, a novel robot finger that\nintegrates camera-based tactile sensing, acoustic sensing, and peripheral\nvisual sensing into a single design that is compact and durable. PolyTouch\nprovides high-resolution tactile feedback across multiple temporal scales,\nwhich is essential for efficiently learning complex manipulation tasks.\nExperiments demonstrate an at least 20-fold increase in lifespan over\ncommercial tactile sensors, with a design that is both easy to manufacture and\nscalable. We then use this multi-modal tactile feedback along with\nvisuo-proprioceptive observations to synthesize a tactile-diffusion policy from\nhuman demonstrations; the resulting contact-aware control policy significantly\noutperforms haptic-oblivious policies in multiple contact-aware manipulation\npolicies.

Because\ncapturing images that avoid these pitfalls is challenging, this severely limits\nthe wider use of SfM, especially by non-expert users. We overcome these\nlimitations by augmenting the classical SfM paradigm with monocular depth and\nnormal priors inferred by deep neural networks. Thanks to a tight integration\nof monocular and multi-view constraints, our approach significantly outperforms\nexisting ones under extreme viewpoint changes, while maintaining strong\nperformance in standard conditions. We also show that monocular priors can help\nreject faulty associations due to symmetries, which is a long-standing problem\nfor SfM.

Deep\nlearning methods have been extensively applied in the grading of diabetic\nretinopathy (DR).

We introduce Low-rank Adaptive Structural Priors (LoASP), a\nplug-and-play framework designed for seamless integration with existing DG\nmodels.

Label-specific\nfeatures (LSFs), constructed by LIFT, have proven effective for learning tasks\nwith label ambiguity by leveraging clustering-based prototypes for each label\nto re-characterize instances. However, directly introducing LIFT into LDL tasks\ncan be suboptimal, as the prototypes it collects primarily reflect\nintra-cluster relationships while neglecting interactions among distinct\nclusters. Additionally, constructing LSFs using multi-perspective information,\nrather than relying solely on Euclidean distance, provides a more robust and\ncomprehensive representation of instances, mitigating noise and bias that may\narise from a single distance perspective. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce Structural Anchor Points (SAPs) to capture inter-cluster\ninteractions. This leads to a novel LSFs construction strategy, LIFT-SAP, which\nenhances LIFT by integrating both distance and direction information of each\ninstance relative to SAPs. Furthermore, we propose a novel LDL algorithm, Label\nDistribution Learning via Label-specifIc FeaTure with SAPs (LDL-LIFT-SAP),\nwhich unifies multiple label description degrees predicted from different LSF\nspaces into a cohesive label distribution.

When\ntrying to apply consecutive edit operations using current models, they\naccumulate artifacts and noise due to repeated transitions between pixel and\nlatent spaces. Some methods have attempted to address this limitation by\nperforming the entire edit chain within the latent space, sacrificing\nflexibility by supporting only a limited, predetermined set of diffusion\nediting operations. We present a RE-encode decode (REED) training scheme for\nvariational autoencoders (VAEs), which promotes image quality preservation even\nafter many iterations. Our work enables multi-method iterative image editing:\nusers can perform a variety of iterative edit operations, with each operation\nbuilding on the output of the previous one using both diffusion-based\noperations and conventional editing techniques. We demonstrate the advantage of\nREED-VAE across a range of image editing scenarios, including text-based and\nmask-based editing frameworks.

However, due to the variability of\ncoordination goals, the complexity of the decision problem, and the\ntime-consumption of trial-and-error in manual design, finding a well\nperformance reward function to guide RL training to solve complex platoon\ncoordination problems remains challenging. In this paper, we formally define\nthe Platoon Coordination Reward Design Problem (PCRDP), extending the RL-based\ncooperative platoon coordination problem to incorporate automated reward\nfunction generation. To address PCRDP, we propose a Large Language Model\n(LLM)-based Platoon coordination Reward Design (PCRD) framework, which\nsystematically automates reward function discovery through LLM-driven\ninitialization and iterative optimization. In this method, LLM first\ninitializes reward functions based on environment code and task requirements\nwith an Analysis and Initial Reward (AIR) module, and then iteratively\noptimizes them based on training feedback with an evolutionary module. The AIR\nmodule guides LLM to deepen their understanding of code and tasks through a\nchain of thought, effectively mitigating hallucination risks in code\ngeneration. The evolutionary module fine-tunes and reconstructs the reward\nfunction, achieving a balance between exploration diversity and convergence\nstability for training. To validate our approach, we establish six challenging\ncoordination scenarios with varying complexity levels within the Yangtze River\nDelta transportation network simulation.

Objective: To develop and evaluate a\ndynamic cardiovascular holographic visualization tool for preoperative CABG\nplanning. Methods: Using 4D cardiac computed tomography angiography data from\n14 CABG candidates, we developed a semi-automated workflow for time-resolved\nsegmentation of cardiac structures, epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), and\ncoronary arteries with calcium scoring. The workflow incorporated methods for\ncardiac segmentation, coronary calcification quantification, visualization of\ncoronary depth within EAT, and pericardial adhesion assessment through motion\nanalysis. Dynamic cardiovascular holograms were displayed using the Looking\nGlass platform. Thirteen cardiac surgeons evaluated the tool using a Likert\nscale. Additionally, pericardial adhesion scores from holograms of 21 patients\n(including seven undergoing secondary cardiac surgeries) were compared with\nintraoperative findings. Results: Surgeons rated the visualization tool highly\nfor preoperative planning utility (mean Likert score: 4.57/5.0). Hologram-based\npericardial adhesion scoring strongly correlated with intraoperative findings\n(r=0.786, P<0.001).

Many human-being applications are conducted daily via\nNLP tasks, starting from machine translation, speech recognition, text\ngeneration and recommendations, Part-of-Speech tagging (POS), and Named-Entity\nRecognition (NER). However, low-resourced languages, such as the\nCentral-Kurdish language (CKL), mainly remain unexamined due to shortage of\nnecessary resources to support their development. The POS tagging task is the\nbase of other NLP tasks; for example, the POS tag set has been used to\nstandardized languages to provide the relationship between words among the\nsentences, followed by machine translation and text recommendation.\nSpecifically, for the CKL, most of the utilized or provided POS tagsets are\nneither standardized nor comprehensive. To this end, this study presented an\naccurate and comprehensive POS tagset for the CKL to provide better performance\nof the Kurdish NLP tasks.

Key\nlimitations include their tendency to hallucinate, lack of source traceability\n(provenance), and challenges in timely knowledge updates. Combining language\nmodels with knowledge graphs (GraphRAG) offers promising avenues for overcoming\nthese deficits. However, a major challenge lies in creating such a knowledge\ngraph in the first place. Here, we propose a novel approach that combines LLMs\nwith a tripartite knowledge graph representation, which is constructed by\nconnecting complex, domain-specific objects via a curated ontology of\ncorresponding, domain-specific concepts to relevant sections within chunks of\ntext through a concept-anchored pre-analysis of source documents starting from\nan initial lexical graph.

This manual process is time-consuming and operator dependent.\nAutomating this process is challenging for preclinical data due to variations\nin brain geometry, resolution, and tissue contrast. While existing methods for\nMRI skull stripping exist, they often struggle with the low resolution and\nvarying slice sizes in preclinical fMRI data. This study proposes a novel\nmethod called SST-DUNet, that integrates a dense UNet-based architecture with a\nfeature extractor based on Smart Swin Transformer (SST) for fMRI skull\nstripping. The Smart Shifted Window Multi-Head Self-Attention (SSW-MSA) module\nin SST is adapted to replace the mask-based module in the Swin Transformer\n(ST), enabling the learning of distinct channel-wise features while focusing on\nrelevant dependencies within brain structures. This modification allows the\nmodel to better handle the complexities of fMRI skull stripping, such as low\nresolution and variable slice sizes. To address the issue of class imbalance in\npreclinical data, a combined loss function using Focal and Dice loss is\nutilized. The model was trained on rat fMRI images and evaluated across three\nin-house datasets with a Dice similarity score of 98.65%, 97.86%, and 98.04%.\nThe fMRI results obtained through automatic skull stripping using the SST-DUNet\nmodel closely align with those from manual skull stripping for both seed-based\nand independent component analyses.

Modeling and calibration errors are therefore unavoidable, making\nthe transfer of control systems from simulation to real-world systems a\ncritical challenge. Traditional robust controls have limitations in handling\ncertain types of nonlinearities and uncertainties, requiring a more practical\napproach capable of comprehensively compensating for these various constraints.\nThis study proposes a new robust control approach using the framework of deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL). The key strategy lies in the synergy among domain\nrandomization-based DRL, long short-term memory (LSTM)-based actor and critic\nnetworks, and model-based control (MBC). The problem setup is modeled via the\nlatent Markov decision process (LMDP), a set of vanilla MDPs, for a controlled\nsystem subject to uncertainties and nonlinearities. In LMDP, the dynamics of an\nenvironment simulator is randomized during training to improve the robustness\nof the control system to real testing environments. The randomization increases\ntraining difficulties as well as conservativeness of the resultant control\nsystem; therefore, progress is assisted by concurrent use of a model-based\ncontroller based on a nominal system model. Compared to traditional DRL-based\ncontrols, the proposed controller design is smarter in that we can achieve a\nhigh level of generalization ability with a more compact neural network\narchitecture and a smaller amount of training data. The proposed approach is\nverified via practical application to active damping for a complex powertrain\nsystem with nonlinearities and parametric variations.

Despite\nthe remarkable empirical success of foundation models, it is not very clear\nwhat representations they learn, and why these representations are useful for\nvarious downstream tasks. A scientific understanding of representation learning\nis critical, especially at this point when scaling up the model size is\nproducing diminishing returns, and designing new pretraining methods is\nimperative for further progress.\n  Prior work treated different representation learning methods quite\ndifferently, whereas the contexture theory provides a unified framework for\nanalyzing these methods. The central argument is that a representation is\nlearned from the association between the input X and a context variable A. We\nprove that if an encoder captures the maximum information of this association,\nin which case we say that the encoder learns the contexture, then it will be\noptimal on the class of tasks that are compatible with the context. We also\nshow that a context is the most useful when the association between X and A is\nneither too strong nor too weak.

This research work identifies 9 primary threats\nand organizes them across five key domains: cognitive architecture\nvulnerabilities, temporal persistence threats, operational execution\nvulnerabilities, trust boundary violations, and governance circumvention. These\nthreats are not just theoretical they bring practical challenges such as\ndelayed exploitability, cross-system propagation, cross system lateral\nmovement, and subtle goal misalignments that are hard to detect with existing\nframeworks and standard approaches. To help address this, the research work\npresent two complementary frameworks: ATFAA - Advanced Threat Framework for\nAutonomous AI Agents, which organizes agent-specific risks, and SHIELD, a\nframework proposing practical mitigation strategies designed to reduce\nenterprise exposure. While this work builds on existing work in LLM and AI\nsecurity, the focus is squarely on what makes agents different and why those\ndifferences matter.

This limitation arises from low-pass filtering effects, gate\nbiases favoring stability, and memory update mechanisms that prioritize\nlong-term information retention. To address these shortcomings, this study\nintroduces a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates both long-term\ntrend and short-term fluctuation information using two input features processed\nin parallel, designed to capture complementary aspects of traffic flow\ndynamics. Further, our approach leverages attention mechanisms, specifically\nBahdanau attention, to selectively focus on critical time steps within traffic\ndata, enhancing the model's ability to predict congestion and other transient\nphenomena. Experimental results demonstrate that features learned from both\nbranches are complementary, significantly improving the goodness-of-fit\nstatistics across multiple prediction horizons compared to a baseline model.\nNotably, the attention mechanism enhances short-term forecast accuracy by\ndirectly targeting immediate fluctuations, though challenges remain in fully\nintegrating long-term trends.

In this paper, we introduce a novel learning\nparadigm -- Modular Machine Learning (MML) -- as an essential approach toward\nnew-generation LLMs. MML decomposes the complex structure of LLMs into three\ninterdependent components: modular representation, modular model, and modular\nreasoning, aiming to enhance LLMs' capability of counterfactual reasoning,\nmitigating hallucinations, as well as promoting fairness, safety, and\ntransparency. Specifically, the proposed MML paradigm can: i) clarify the\ninternal working mechanism of LLMs through the disentanglement of semantic\ncomponents; ii) allow for flexible and task-adaptive model design; iii) enable\ninterpretable and logic-driven decision-making process. We present a feasible\nimplementation of MML-based LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as\ndisentangled representation learning, neural architecture search and\nneuro-symbolic learning. We critically identify key challenges, such as the\nintegration of continuous neural and discrete symbolic processes, joint\noptimization, and computational scalability, present promising future research\ndirections that deserve further exploration. Ultimately, the integration of the\nMML paradigm with LLMs has the potential to bridge the gap between statistical\n(deep) learning and formal (logical) reasoning, thereby paving the way for\nrobust, adaptable, and trustworthy AI systems across a wide range of real-world\napplications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u2014\u2014\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MML\uff09\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "MML\u5c06LLMs\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8868\u793a\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89e3\u8026\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "MML\u80fd\u591f\u660e\u786eLLMs\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u9a71\u52a8\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "MML\u8303\u5f0f\u6709\u671b\u5f25\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5f62\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}
