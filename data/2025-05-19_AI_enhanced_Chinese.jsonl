However,\nphysiological data characterized by cross-subject variability and noisy labels\nhinder the performance of emotion recognition models. Existing domain\nadaptation and continual learning methods struggle to address these issues,\nespecially under realistic conditions where data is continuously streamed and\nunlabeled. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel bi-level\nself-supervised continual learning framework, SSOCL, based on a dynamic memory\nbuffer. This bi-level architecture iteratively refines the dynamic buffer and\npseudo-label assignments to effectively retain representative samples, enabling\ngeneralization from continuous, unlabeled physiological data streams for\nemotion recognition. The assigned pseudo-labels are subsequently leveraged for\naccurate emotion prediction. Key components of the framework, including a fast\nadaptation module and a cluster-mapping module, enable robust learning and\neffective handling of evolving data streams.

In this work, we explore the fairness and bias of FMs for breast\nmammography classification by leveraging a large pool of datasets from diverse\nsources-including data from underrepresented regions and an in-house dataset.\nOur extensive experiments show that while modality-specific pre-training of FMs\nenhances performance, classifiers trained on features from individual datasets\nfail to generalize across domains. Aggregating datasets improves overall\nperformance, yet does not fully mitigate biases, leading to significant\ndisparities across under-represented subgroups such as extreme breast densities\nand age groups.

Moreover, we\ngenerate multi-level sparsity ST-GCNs by integrating sparse structures at\nvarious sparsity levels and demonstrate that the assembled model yields a\nsignificant enhancement in HAR performance. Thorough experiments on four\ndatasets, including NTU-RGB+D 60(120), Kinetics-400, and FineGYM, demonstrate\nthat the proposed sparse ST-GCNs can achieve comparable performance to their\ndense components. Even with 95% fewer parameters, the sparse ST-GCNs exhibit a\ndegradation of <1% in top-1 accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-level sparsity\nST-GCNs, which require only 66% of the parameters of the dense ST-GCNs,\ndemonstrate an improvement of >1% in top-1 accuracy.

Although several foundation models for\nbiomedical segmentation have currently achieved excellent performance on\ncertain datasets, they typically demonstrate sub-optimal performance on unseen\ndomain data.

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) bring outstanding\nunderstanding and reasoning capabilities to multimodal tasks, which inspires us\nto leverage MLLMs to inject Vision-Language Knowledge (VLK), thereby enabling\nvision models to demonstrate superior generalization capabilities on\ncross-domain datasets. In this paper, we propose using MLLMs to guide SAM in\nlearning microscopy crose-domain data, unifying Segment Anything in Microscopy,\nnamed uLLSAM.

Although current\nNeRF-based methods have achieved impressive results in reconstructing\nbuilding-scale scenes, they still suffer from slow training and inference\nspeeds due to time-consuming stochastic sampling. Recently, 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS) has demonstrated excellent performance with its high-quality\nrendering and real-time speed, especially for objects and small-scale scenes.\nHowever, in outdoor scenes, its point-based explicit representation lacks an\neffective adjustment mechanism, and the millions of Gaussian points required\noften lead to memory constraints during training. To address these challenges,\nwe propose EA-3DGS, a high-quality real-time rendering method designed for\noutdoor scenes. First, we introduce a mesh structure to regulate the\ninitialization of Gaussian components by leveraging an adaptive tetrahedral\nmesh that partitions the grid and initializes Gaussian components on each face,\neffectively capturing geometric structures in low-texture regions.

To tackle this issue, we propose RefPose, an innovative approach to\nobject pose estimation that leverages a reference image and geometric\ncorrespondence as guidance. RefPose first predicts an initial pose by using\nobject templates to render the reference image and establish the geometric\ncorrespondence needed for the refinement stage. During the refinement stage,\nRefPose estimates the geometric correspondence of the query based on the\ngenerated references and iteratively refines the pose through a\nrender-and-compare approach.

However,\ntwo key questions remain: 1) Can these representations be leveraged to improve\nthe training of diffusion models themselves, rather than solely benefiting\ndownstream tasks? 2) Can the feature quality be enhanced to rival or even\nsurpass modern self-supervised learners, without compromising generative\ncapability? This work addresses these questions by introducing\nself-conditioning, a straightforward yet effective mechanism that internally\nleverages the rich semantics inherent in denoising network to guide its own\ndecoding layers, forming a tighter bottleneck that condenses high-level\nsemantics to improve generation. Results are compelling: our method boosts both\ngeneration FID and recognition accuracy with 1% computational overhead and\ngeneralizes across diverse diffusion architectures.

To identify these biases, methods that interpret high-level,\nhuman-understandable concepts are more effective than those relying primarily\non low-level features like heatmaps. A major challenge for these concept-based\nmethods is the lack of image annotations indicating potentially bias-inducing\nconcepts, since creating such annotations requires detailed labeling for each\ndataset and concept, which is highly labor-intensive. We present CUBIC (Concept\nembeddings for Unsupervised Bias IdentifiCation), a novel method that\nautomatically discovers interpretable concepts that may bias classifier\nbehavior. Unlike existing approaches, CUBIC does not rely on predefined bias\ncandidates or examples of model failures tied to specific biases, as such\ninformation is not always available.

Each pretraining image is often associated with multiple\ncaptions containing redundant information due to repeated or semantically\nsimilar phrases, resulting in increased pretraining and inference time. To\novercome this, we introduce a weighted feature aggregation (WFA) strategy for\nVLM pretraining in RS. Our strategy aims to extract and exploit complementary\ninformation from multiple captions per image while reducing redundancies\nthrough feature aggregation with importance weighting. To calculate adaptive\nimportance weights for different captions of each image, we propose two\ntechniques: (i) non-parametric uniqueness and (ii) learning-based attention. In\nthe first technique, importance weights are calculated based on the bilingual\nevaluation understudy (BLEU) scores of the captions to emphasize unique\nsentences and reduce the influence of repetitive ones. In the second technique,\nimportance weights are learned through an attention mechanism instead of\nrelying on hand-crafted features. The effectiveness of the proposed WFA\nstrategy with the two techniques is analyzed in terms of downstream performance\non text-to-image retrieval in RS. Experimental results show that the proposed\nstrategy enables efficient and effective pretraining of VLMs in RS. Based on\nthe experimental analysis, we derive guidelines for selecting appropriate\ntechniques depending on downstream task requirements and resource constraints.\nThe code of this work is publicly available at\nhttps://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/redundacy-aware-rs-vlm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a0\u6743\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\uff08WFA\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9065\u611f\uff08RS\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9065\u611f\u9886\u57dfVLM\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u591a\u63cf\u8ff0\u5197\u4f59\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u8ba1\u7b97\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6743\u91cd\uff1a\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u552f\u4e00\u6027\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eWFA\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u5730\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VLM\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u5357\u3002", "conclusion": "WFA\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u9065\u611f\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u516c\u5f00\u3002"}}

Not Final Version", "summary": "Concept erasing has recently emerged as an effective paradigm to prevent\ntext-to-image diffusion models from generating visually undesirable or even\nharmful content. However, current removal methods heavily rely on manually\ncrafted text prompts, making it challenging to achieve a high erasure\n(efficacy) while minimizing the impact on other benign concepts (usability). In\nthis paper, we attribute the limitations to the inherent gap between the text\nand image modalities, which makes it hard to transfer the intricately entangled\nconcept knowledge from text prompts to the image generation process. To address\nthis, we propose a novel solution by directly integrating visual supervision\ninto the erasure process, introducing the first text-image Collaborative\nConcept Erasing (Co-Erasing) framework. Specifically, Co-Erasing describes the\nconcept jointly by text prompts and the corresponding undesirable images\ninduced by the prompts, and then reduces the generating probability of the\ntarget concept through negative guidance. This approach effectively bypasses\nthe knowledge gap between text and image, significantly enhancing erasure\nefficacy. Additionally, we design a text-guided image concept refinement\nstrategy that directs the model to focus on visual features most relevant to\nthe specified text concept, minimizing disruption to other benign concepts.\nFinally, comprehensive experiments suggest that Co-Erasing outperforms\nstate-of-the-art erasure approaches significantly with a better trade-off\nbetween efficacy and usability.

(2) Excessive reliance on consistency\nresults in unreliable imputation and alignment without incorporating\nview-specific cluster information. Thus, we propose an IMVC framework,\nimputation- and alignment-free for consensus semantics learning (FreeCSL). To\nbridge semantic gaps across all observations, we learn consensus prototypes\nfrom available data to discover a shared space, where semantically similar\nobservations are pulled closer for consensus semantics learning.

Our setup consists of a stereo-event camera and an\nRGB camera, capturing 75 scenes, each on average 16 seconds, and featuring 16\nunique objects under challenging conditions such as extreme viewing angles,\nvarying lighting, and occlusions. MTevent is the first dataset to combine\nhigh-speed motion, long-range perception, and real-world object interactions,\nmaking it a valuable resource for advancing event-based vision in robotics. To\nestablish a baseline, we evaluate the task of 6D pose estimation using NVIDIA's\nFoundationPose on RGB images, achieving an Average Recall of 0.22 with\nground-truth masks, highlighting the limitations of RGB-based approaches in\nsuch dynamic settings. With MTevent, we provide a novel resource to improve\nperception models and foster further research in high-speed robotic vision.

Currently, autoregressive modeling approaches have achieved\nremarkable performance in motion generation tasks, e.g. text-to-motion.\nHowever, vector quantization (VQ) accompanying autoregressive generation has\ninherent disadvantages, including loss of quantization information, low\ncodebook utilization, etc. Moreover, unlike text-to-motion, which focuses\nsolely on the movement of body joints, human action-reaction synthesis also\nencompasses fine-grained hand movements. In this work, we propose MARRS, a\nnovel framework designed to generate coordinated and fine-grained reaction\nmotions in continuous representations. Initially, we present the\nUnit-distinguished Motion Variational AutoEncoder (UD-VAE), which segments the\nentire body into distinct body and hand units, encoding them independently.\nSubsequently, we propose Action-Conditioned Fusion (ACF), which involves\nrandomly masking a subset of reactive tokens and extracting specific\ninformation about the body and hands from the active tokens. Furthermore, we\nintroduce Adaptive Unit Modulation (AUM) to facilitate interaction between body\nand hand units by using the information from one unit to adaptively modulate\nthe other.

However, existing methods by default employ the pretrained model\nas the base model and compress the delta parameters for every task, which may\ncauses significant performance degradation, especially when the compression\nrate is extremely high. To tackle this issue, we investigate the impact of\ndifferent base models on the performance of delta compression and find that the\npre-trained base model can hardly be optimal. To this end, we propose Dynamic\nBase Model Shift (DBMS), which dynamically adapts the base model to the target\ntask before performing delta compression.

Through low-cost learning of these two parameters,\nour DBMS can maintain most of the finetuned model's performance even under an\nextremely high compression ratio setting, significantly surpassing existing\nmethods.

Recent advances in\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced their\ncapabilities in this area. However, MLLMs often suffer from hallucinations,\ngenerating irrelevant or nonsensical content. To the best of our knowledge,\ndespite the importance of this issue, there has been no dedicated effort to\nevaluate emotion-related hallucinations in MLLMs. In this work, we introduce\nEmotionHallucer, the first benchmark for detecting and analyzing emotion\nhallucinations in MLLMs. Unlike humans, whose emotion understanding stems from\nthe interplay of biology and social learning, MLLMs rely solely on data-driven\nlearning and lack innate emotional instincts. Fortunately, emotion psychology\nprovides a solid foundation of knowledge about human emotions. Building on\nthis, we assess emotion hallucinations from two dimensions: emotion psychology\nknowledge and real-world multimodal perception. To support robust evaluation,\nwe utilize an adversarial binary question-answer (QA) framework, which employs\ncarefully crafted basic and hallucinated pairs to assess the emotion\nhallucination tendencies of MLLMs. By evaluating 38 LLMs and MLLMs on\nEmotionHallucer, we reveal that: i) most current models exhibit substantial\nissues with emotion hallucinations; ii) closed-source models outperform\nopen-source ones in detecting emotion hallucinations, and reasoning capability\nprovides additional advantages; iii) existing models perform better in emotion\npsychology knowledge than in multimodal emotion perception. As a byproduct,\nthese findings inspire us to propose the PEP-MEK framework, which yields an\naverage improvement of 9.90% in emotion hallucination detection across selected\nmodels.

Accurate segmentation of these subregions from histological tissue\nimages is essential for advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms,\ndevelopmental dynamics, and therapeutic interventions. However, no existing\nmethods address the automated segmentation of hippocampal subregions from\ntissue images, particularly from immunohistochemistry (IHC) images. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce a novel set of four comprehensive murine hippocampal IHC\ndatasets featuring distinct staining modalities: cFos, NeuN, and multiplexed\nstains combining cFos, NeuN, and either {\\Delta}FosB or GAD67, capturing\nstructural, neuronal activity, and plasticity associated information.\nAdditionally, we propose ROIsGAN, a region-guided U-Net-based generative\nadversarial network tailored for hippocampal subregion segmentation.

PASC manifests as a diverse array\nof persistent or newly emerging symptoms--ranging from fatigue, dyspnea, and\nneurologic impairments (e.g., brain fog), to cardiovascular, pulmonary, and\nmusculoskeletal abnormalities--that extend beyond the acute infection phase.\nThis heterogeneous presentation poses substantial challenges for clinical\nassessment, diagnosis, and treatment planning.

Previous data collection typically relies on teleoperation or\ntraining expert reinforcement learning (RL) policies, which are labor-intensive\nand inefficient. In this paper, we leverage garment structural correspondence\nto automatically generate a dataset with diverse trajectories using only a\nsingle expert demonstration, significantly reducing manual intervention.\nHowever, even extensive demonstrations cannot cover the infinite states of\ngarments, which necessitates the exploration of new algorithms. To improve\ngeneralization across diverse garment shapes and deformations, we propose a\nHierarchical gArment-manipuLation pOlicy (HALO). It first identifies\ntransferable affordance points to accurately locate the manipulation area, then\ngenerates generalizable trajectories to complete the task. Through extensive\nexperiments and detailed analysis of our method and baseline, we demonstrate\nthat HALO consistently outperforms existing methods, successfully generalizing\nto previously unseen instances even with significant variations in shape and\ndeformation where others fail.

Even with limited training data, the refined model surpasses\nexisting benchmarks.

This includes measuring\nthe spatial distribution of cell bodies (cytoarchitecture) and nerve fibers\n(myeloarchitecture). The gold standard for cytoarchitectonic analysis is light\nmicroscopic imaging of cell-body stained tissue sections. To reveal the 3D\norientations of nerve fibers, 3D Polarized Light Imaging (3D-PLI) has been\nintroduced as a reliable technique providing a resolution in the micrometer\nrange while allowing processing of series of complete brain sections. 3D-PLI\nacquisition is label-free and allows subsequent staining of sections after\nmeasurement. By post-staining for cell bodies, a direct link between fiber- and\ncytoarchitecture can potentially be established within the same section.\nHowever, inevitable distortions introduced during the staining process make a\nnonlinear and cross-modal registration necessary in order to study the detailed\nrelationships between cells and fibers in the images. In addition, the\ncomplexity of processing histological sections for post-staining only allows\nfor a limited number of samples. In this work, we take advantage of deep\nlearning methods for image-to-image translation to generate a virtual staining\nof 3D-PLI that is spatially aligned at the cellular level. In a supervised\nsetting, we build on a unique dataset of brain sections, to which Cresyl violet\nstaining has been applied after 3D-PLI measurement. To ensure high\ncorrespondence between both modalities, we address the misalignment of training\ndata using Fourier-based registration methods.
