Abstract: Motivated by the recent Year-2 data release of the DESI collaboration, we
update our results on time-varying dark energy models driven by the
Cohen-Kaplan-Nelson bound. The previously found preference of time-dependent
dark energy models compared to $\Lambda$CDM is further strengthend by the new
data release. For our particular models, we find that this preference increases
up to $\approx 2.6\,\sigma$ depending on the used supernova dataset.

Abstract: In the presence of a weak gravitational wave (GW) background, astrophysical
binary systems act as high-quality resonators, with efficient transfer of
energy and momentum between the orbit and a harmonic GW leading to potentially
detectable orbital perturbations. In this work, we develop and apply a novel
modeling and analysis framework that describes the imprints of GWs on binary
systems in a fully time-resolved manner to study the sensitivity of lunar laser
ranging, satellite laser ranging, and pulsar timing to both resonant and
nonresonant GW backgrounds. We demonstrate that optimal data collection,
modeling, and analysis lead to projected sensitivities which are orders of
magnitude better than previously appreciated possible, opening up a new
possibility for probing the physics-rich but notoriously challenging to access
$\mu\mathrm{Hz}$ frequency GWs. We also discuss improved prospects for the
detection of the stochastic fluctuations of ultra-light dark matter, which may
analogously perturb the binary orbits.

### [3] [On DESI's DR2 exclusion of $Λ$CDM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15336)
*Marina Cortês,Andrew R Liddle*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: DESI合作组结合BAO、CMB和各超新星数据集，发现显著证据反对ΛCDM宇宙学，但不同数据集结果不一致。通过统计方法得出最可靠的排除显著性为3.1σ。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨DESI数据对ΛCDM宇宙学的挑战，分析不同数据集结果的差异及其影响。

Method: 结合BAO、CMB和各超新星数据集，通过统计方法评估ΛCDM的排除显著性。

Result: 不同超新星数据集对ΛCDM的排除显著性不一致（2.8σ至4.2σ），统计组合后为3.1σ。

Conclusion: 最可靠的结论是DESI+CMB组合（不含超新星数据）对ΛCDM的3.1σ排除显著性。

Abstract: The DESI collaboration, combining their Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO)
data with cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy and supernovae data,
have found significant indication against $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. The
significance of the exclusion of $\Lambda$CDM can be interpreted entirely as
significance of the detection of the $\boldsymbol{w_a}$ parameter that measures
variation of the dark energy equation of state. We emphasize that DESI's DR2
exclusion of $\Lambda$CDM is quoted in the articles for a combination of BAO
and CMB data with each of three different and overlapping supernovae datasets
(at 2.8-sigma for Pantheon+, 3.8-sigma for Union3, and 4.2-sigma for DESY5). We
show that one can neither choose amongst nor average over these three different
significances. We demonstrate how a principled statistical combination yields a
combined exclusion significance of 3.1-sigma. Further we argue that, based on
available knowledge, and faced with these competing significances, the most
secure inference from the DESI DR2 results is the 3.1-sigma level exclusion of
$\Lambda$CDM, obtained from combining DESI+CMB alone, while omitting
supernovae.

### [4] [Cosmology in Extended Parameter Space with DESI DR2 BAO: A 2$σ$+ Detection of Non-zero Neutrino Masses with an Update on Dynamical Dark Energy and Lensing Anomaly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15340)
*Shouvik Roy Choudhury*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 论文通过结合多种宇宙学数据（如BAO、CMB、SNe、WL等），研究了包含12个参数的宇宙学模型，发现了一些重要结果，如中微子质量的首次2σ+检测、暗能量动态性的不确定性、透镜异常的可能存在性，以及哈勃张力的持续存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在利用最新的多源宇宙学数据，对包含12个参数的扩展宇宙学模型进行约束，以探索中微子质量、暗能量动态性、透镜异常等关键问题。

Method: 结合DESI DR2 BAO数据、Planck PR4 CMB数据、ACT DR6透镜数据、Pantheon+和DESY5 SNe数据，以及DES Year 1 WL数据，对包含ΛCDM参数和额外6个参数的模型进行分析。

Result: 1) 首次2σ+检测到非零中微子质量；2) 暗能量动态性证据不明确；3) 透镜异常可能与非CMB数据集相关；4) 哈勃张力持续存在。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了中微子质量、暗能量动态性和透镜异常的新证据，同时确认了哈勃张力的持续存在，为未来宇宙学研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: We obtain constraints in a 12 parameter cosmological model using the recent
DESI Data Release (DR) 2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data, combined with
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectra (Planck Public Release (PR) 4)
and lensing (Planck PR4 + Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release (DR)
6) data, uncalibrated type Ia Supernovae (SNe) data from Pantheon+ and Dark
Energy Survey (DES) Year 5 (DESY5) samples, and Weak Lensing (WL: DES Year 1)
data. The cosmological model consists of six $\Lambda$CDM parameters, and
additionally, the dynamical dark energy parameters ($w_0$, $w_a$), the sum of
neutrino masses ($\sum m_{\nu}$), the effective number of non-photon radiation
species ($N_{\textrm{eff}}$), the scaling of the lensing amplitude
($A_{\textrm{lens}}$), and the running of the scalar spectral index
($\alpha_s$). Our major findings are the following: i) With CMB+BAO+DESY5+WL,
we obtain the first 2$\sigma$+ detection of a non-zero $\sum m_{\nu} =
0.19^{+0.15}_{-0.18}$ eV (95%). Replacing DESY5 with Pantheon+ still yields a
$\sim$1.9$\sigma$ detection. ii) The cosmological constant lies at the edge of
the 95% contour with CMB+BAO+Pantheon+, but is excluded at 2$\sigma$+ with
DESY5, leaving evidence for dynamical dark energy inconclusive, contrary to
claims by DESI collaboration. iii) With CMB+BAO+SNe+WL, $A_{\textrm{lens}} = 1$
is excluded at $>2\sigma$, while it remains consistent with unity without WL
data - suggesting for the first time that the existence of lensing anomaly may
depend on non-CMB datasets. iv) The Hubble tension persists at 3.6-4.2$\sigma$
with CMB+BAO+SNe; WL data has minimal impact.

### [5] [Joint 21-cm and CMB Forecasts for Constraining Self-Interacting Massive Neutrinos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15348)

Conclusion: 21厘米功率谱是研究中微子自相互作用的有效工具，未来实验将进一步增强约束能力。

Abstract: Self-interacting neutrinos provide an intriguing extension to the Standard
Model, motivated by both particle physics and cosmology. Recent cosmological
analyses suggest a bimodal posterior for the coupling strength $G_{\rm eff}$,
favoring either strong or moderate interactions. These interactions modify the
scale-dependence of the growth of cosmic structures, leaving distinct imprints
on the matter power spectrum at small scales, $k\,>\,0.1\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. For
the first time, we explore how the 21-cm power spectrum from the cosmic dawn
and the dark ages can constrain the properties of self-interacting, massive
neutrinos. The effects of small-scale suppression and enhancement in the matter
power spectrum caused by self-interacting neutrinos propagate to the halo mass
function, shaping the abundance of small- and intermediate-mass halos. It is
precisely these halos that host the galaxies responsible for driving the
evolution of the 21-cm signal during the cosmic dawn. We find that HERA at its
design sensitivity can improve upon existing constraints on $G_{\rm eff}$ and
be sensitive to small values of the coupling, beyond the reach of current and
future CMB experiments. Crucially, we find that the combination of HERA and
CMB-S4 can break parameter degeneracies, significantly improving the
sensitivity to $G_{\rm eff}$ over either experiment alone. Finally, we
investigate the prospects of probing neutrino properties with futuristic Lunar
interferometers, accessing the astrophysics-free 21-cm power spectrum during
the dark ages. The capability of probing small scales of these instruments will
allow us to reach a percent-level constraint on the neutrino self-coupling.

### [6] [On the Connection between Field-Level Inference and $n$-point Correlation Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15351)
*Fabian Schmidt*

Result: 研究发现，第m阶正向模型能捕捉到n≤m+1点相关函数的信息，通过扩展模型可以自动包含更高阶信息。

Conclusion: 场级推断通过扩展正向模型可以稳健地提取高阶信息，同时提供了估计模型不完整性对参数推断影响的方法。

Abstract: Bayesian field-level inference of galaxy clustering guarantees optimal
extraction of all cosmological information, provided that the data are
correctly described by the forward model employed. The latter is unfortunately
never strictly the case. A key question for field-level inference approaches
then is where the cosmological information is coming from, and how to ensure
that it is robust. In the context of perturbative approaches such as effective
field theory, some progress on this question can be made analytically. We
derive the parameter posterior given the data for the field-level likelihood
given in the effective field theory, marginalized over initial conditions in
the zero-noise limit. Particular attention is paid to cutoffs in the theory,
the generalization to higher orders, and the error made by an incomplete
forward model at a given order. The main finding is that, broadly speaking, an
$m$-th order forward model captures the information in $n$-point correlation
functions with $n \leqslant m+1$. Thus, by adding more terms to the forward
model, field-level inference is made to automatically incorporate higher-order
$n$-point functions. Also shown is how the effect of an incomplete forward
model (at a given order) on the parameter inference can be estimated.

### [7] [The Glow of Axion Quark Nugget Dark Matter: (III) The Mysteries of the Milky Way UV Background](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15382)
*Michael Sekatchev,Xunyu Liang,Fereshteh Majidi,Ben Scully,Ludovic Van Waerbeke,Ariel Zhitnitsky*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 论文研究了轴子夸克块（AQNs）作为暗物质的假设对象，计算了其与重子相互作用产生的FUV电磁信号，并与观测结果一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AQNs作为暗物质的候选者，解释宇宙中物质-反物质不对称性及可见物质与暗物质的相似性。

Method: 利用高分辨率流体动力学模拟（FIRE-2 Latter suite）选择类太阳系区域，计算AQN模型产生的FUV背景辐射。

Result: 计算结果与New Horizons和GALEX观测到的FUV过剩一致，支持AQNs的存在。

Conclusion: AQNs可能是暗物质的新来源，其与重子相互作用产生的FUV辐射对宇宙学有重要意义。

Abstract: Axion quark nuggets (AQNs) are hypothetical objects with nuclear density that
would have formed during the quark-hadron transition and could make up most of
the dark matter today. These objects have a mass greater than a few grams and
are sub-micrometer in size. They would also help explain the matter-antimatter
asymmetry and the similarity between visible and dark components of the
universe, i.e. $\Omega_{\text{DM}} \sim \Omega_{\text{visible}}$. These
composite objects behave as cold dark matter, interacting with ordinary matter
and producing pervasive electromagnetic radiation. This work aims to calculate
the FUV electromagnetic signature in a 1 kpc region surrounding the solar
system, resulting from the interaction between antimatter AQNs and baryons. To
this end, we use the high-resolution hydrodynamic simulation of the Milky Way,
FIRE-2 Latter suite, to select solar system-like regions. From the simulated
gas and dark matter distributions in these regions, we calculate the FUV
background radiation generated by the AQN model. We find that the results are
consistent with the FUV excess recently confirmed by the Alice spectrograph
aboard New Horizons, which corroborated the FUV excess initially discovered by
GALEX a decade ago. We also discuss the potential cosmological implications of
our work, which suggest the existence of a new source of FUV radiation in
galaxies, linked to the interaction between dark matter and baryons.

Conclusion: 该机制为宇宙大尺度磁场的起源提供了新解释，并可通过未来观测验证。

Abstract: Any attempt to understand the ubiquitous nature of the magnetic field in the
present universe seems to lead us towards its primordial origin. For
large-scale magnetic fields, however, their strength and length scale may not
necessarily originate from a singular primordial mechanism, namely inflationary
magnetogenesis, which has been a popular consideration in the literature. In
this paper, we propose a minimal scenario wherein a large-scale magnetic field
is generated from the inflationary perturbation without any non-conformal
coupling. Due to their origin in the inflationary scalar spectrum, these
primordial fields are inherently weak, with their strength suppressed by the
small amplitude of scalar fluctuations. We then consider the coupling between
this large-scale weak primordial magnetic field and a light axion of mass
$<10^{-28}$ eV, which is assumed to be frozen in a misaligned state until the
photon decoupling. After the decoupling, when the universe enters into a dark
age, the light axion coherently oscillates. By appropriately tuning the
axion-photon coupling parameter $\alpha$, we demonstrate that a large-scale
magnetic field of sufficient strength can indeed be generated through tachyonic
resonance. We further show that the produced magnetic field induces a unique
spectrum with multiple peaks of secondary gravitational waves, which the
upcoming CMB-S4 can probe through B-mode polarization. The strength can be
sufficient enough to violate the PLANCK bound on tensor-to-scalar ratio $r
\lesssim 0.036$. Such a violation leads to a constraint on $\alpha \lesssim
80$. With this limiting value of the coupling, we find that present-day
magnetic field strength could be as high as $10^{-10}$ Gauss at $\Mpc$ scale,
consistent with observation.

*Paula S. Ferreira,Carlos Hernández-Monteagudo,Ribamar R. R. Reis*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 研究2D角度和红移空间中的重子声波振荡（BAO），探讨其在角谱和红移谱中的特征及其对宇宙学和星系偏置参数的约束作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索BAO在角谱和红移谱中的表现，以提升对宇宙学参数（如H0和暗能量参数）的约束能力。

Method: 通过Fisher预测分析，研究BAO在角谱和红移谱中的特征，并比较不同红移壳配置对信息提取的影响。

Result: 联合分析（ADF+ARF）显著提升对宇宙学参数的约束；窄红移壳配置能更好地保留宇宙学信息。

Conclusion: BAO特征在角谱和红移谱中携带重要信息，联合分析和窄红移壳配置可显著提升宇宙学约束能力。

Abstract: In this work we examine the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in 2D angular
and redshift space $\{\theta, \Delta z\}$, with $\Delta z$ denoting the
redshift difference between two given angular shells. We thus work in the
context of tomographic analyses of the large scale structure (LSS) where data
are sliced in different redshift shells and constraints on Cosmology are
extracted from the auto and cross-angular spectra of two different probes,
namely the standard galaxy angular density fluctuations (ADF, or 2D
clustering), and the galaxy angular redshift fluctuations (ARF). For these two
observables we study by first time how the BAO peak arises in the $\{\theta,
\Delta z\}$ plane. Despite being a weak feature (particularly for $\Delta z
\neq 0$), a Fisher forecast analysis shows that, a priori, most of the
information on cosmological and galaxy bias parameters is carried by the BAO
features in shell auto- and cross-angular power spectra. The same study shows
that a joint probe analysis (ADF+ARF) increases the Fisher determinant
associated to cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ or the Dark Energy
Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameters $\{w_0,w_a\}$ by at least an order
of magnitude. We also study how the Fisher information on cosmological and
galaxy bias-related parameters behaves under different redshift shell
configurations: including cross-correlations to neighbour shells extending up
to $(\Delta z)^{\rm tot}\sim 0.6$ ($(\Delta z)^{\rm tot}\sim 0.4$) for ADF
(ARF) is required for Fisher information to converge. At the same time,
configurations using narrow shell widths ($\sigma_z \leq 0.02$) preserve the
cosmological information associated to peculiar velocities and typically yield
Fisher determinants that are about two orders of magnitudes larger than for
wider shell ($\sigma_z>0.02$) configurations.

### [10] [An analytic redshift-independent formulation of baryonic effects on the matter power spectrum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15633)
*Matthieu Schaller,Joop Schaye*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的方法，通过使用sigmoid函数来近似模拟重子效应对物质功率谱的影响，并验证了其在FLAMINGO模拟中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究重子效应（如星系形成中的反馈过程）对大规模结构模型的影响，为未来的弱引力透镜调查提供快速预测方法。

Method: 使用FLAMINGO流体动力学模拟，测试并改进了一种将物质功率谱近似为线性功率谱与非线性功率谱差值的加权和的方法，引入sigmoid函数以适应不同反馈强度和宇宙学模型。

Result: 改进后的sigmoid函数方法能有效匹配不同反馈强度和宇宙学模型的模拟结果，但需要更多参数来描述喷流式AGN反馈。

Conclusion: 该方法在标准ΛCDM模型中表现良好，但在偏离ΛCDM的宇宙学模型中需要更复杂的重子响应模型。

Abstract: Baryonic effects created by feedback processes associated with galaxy
formation are an important, poorly constrained systematic effect for models of
large-scale structure as probed by weak gravitational lensing. Upcoming surveys
require fast methods to predict and marginalize over the potential impact of
baryons on the total matter power spectrum. Here we use the FLAMINGO
cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to test a recent proposal to
approximate the matter power spectrum as the sum of the linear matter power
spectrum and a constant multiple, $A_{\rm mod}$, of the difference between the
linear and non-linear gravity-only power spectra. We show that replacing this
constant multiple with a one-parameter family of sigmoid functions of the
wavenumber $k$ allows to us match the predictions of simulations with different
feedback strengths for $z \leq 1, k < 3~h\cdot{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, and the
different cosmological models in the FLAMINGO suite. The baryonic response
predicted by FLAMINGO models that use jet-like AGN feedback instead of the
fiducial thermally-driven AGN feedback can also be reproduced, but at the cost
of increasing the number of parameters in the sigmoid function from one to
three. The assumption that $A_{\rm mod}$ depends only on $k$ breaks down for
decaying dark matter models, highlighting the need for more advanced baryon
response models when studying cosmological models that deviate strongly from
$\Lambda$CDM.

Result: 在超过5σ置信水平下，宇宙经历三重减速，最终进入‘大停滞’状态，暗物质主导未来宇宙。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了宇宙加速膨胀的传统理解，丰富了宇宙演化的认识。

Abstract: One of the most important discoveries in modern cosmology is cosmic
acceleration. However, we find that today's universe could decelerate in the
statistically preferred Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) scenario over the
$\Lambda$CDM model by cosmic microwave background, type Ia supernova and DESI's
new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Using various datasets, at a
beyond $5\,\sigma$ confidence level, we demonstrate that the universe
experiences a triple deceleration during its evolution and finally reaches the
state of the ``Big Stall", which predicts that: (i) the universe suddenly comes
to a halt in the distant future; (ii) its eventual destiny is dominated by dark
matter rather than dark energy ; (iii) it ultimately retains an extremely small
fraction of dark energy but exerts an extremely large pressure. Our findings
profoundly challenge the established understanding of cosmic acceleration and
enrich our comprehension of cosmic evolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前超新星统计数据预计将增长10倍，需要高效且无偏的宇宙学分析方法。

Method: EDRIS通过最大化似然函数，在统计模型中直接包含数据截断，实现单步距离估计。

Result: EDRIS的时间复杂度为O(N^2)，处理1500颗超新星仅需约10秒，计算效率高。

Conclusion: EDRIS提供了一种快速且无偏的宇宙学距离估计方法，适用于未来大规模超新星调查。

Abstract: In this work, we present EDRIS (French for Distance Estimator for Incomplete
Supernova Surveys), a cosmological inference framework tailored to reconstruct
unbiased cosmological distances from type Ia supernovae light-curve parameters.
This goal is achieved by including data truncation directly in the statistical
model which takes care of the standardization of luminosity distances. It
allows us to build a single-step distance estimate by maximizing the
corresponding likelihood, free from the biases the survey detection limits
would introduce otherwise. Moreover, we expect the current worldwide statistics
to be multiplied by O(10) in the upcoming years. This provides a new challenge
to handle as the cosmological analysis must stay computationally towable. We
show that the optimization methods used in EDRIS allow for a reasonable time
complexity of O($N^2$) resulting in a very fast inference process (O(10s) for
1500 supernovae).

Abstract: The enhanced primordial scalar power spectrum is a widely studied mechanism
for generating primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), also referred to as
scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs). This process also plays a pivotal
role in facilitating the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs).
Traditionally, the ultra slow-roll (USR) mechanism has been the predominant
approach used in the early universe. In this framework, the second slow-roll
parameter $\epsilon_2$, is typically set to $-6$ or lower for a brief period --
marking a significant departure from the standard slow-roll condition where
$\epsilon_2 \simeq 0$. Such conditions often emerge in models with inflection
points or localized features, such as bumps in the potential. In this paper, we
challenge the conventional assumption that $\epsilon_2 \lesssim -6$ is a
prerequisite for substantial amplification of the scalar power spectrum. We
demonstrate that any negative value of the second slow-roll parameter can
indeed enhance the scalar power spectrum through sub-horizon growth,
establishing this as a necessary and sufficient condition for amplification.
Consequently, this mechanism facilitates the generation of both PGWs and PBHs.
To illustrate this, we examine a standard scenario where a brief USR phase is
embedded between two slow-roll (SR) phases. By systematically varying
$\epsilon_{2}$ values from $-1$ to $-10$ in the USR region, we investigate the
amplification of the power spectrum and its implications for PGWs and PBHs
production, particularly in the context of ongoing and future cosmological
missions.

Result: 正则化后的极点膨胀模型可以自然地增加$n_s$，且与最新的ACT数据一致，同时保留了$\alpha$-吸引子模型的成功。

Conclusion: 正则化极点膨胀是一种有效的方法，可以调整$n_s$以符合最新观测数据，同时保持模型的统一性和吸引力。

Abstract: We show that the regularization of the second order pole in the pole
inflation can induce the increase of $n_s$, which may be important after the
latest data release of cosmic microwave background (CMB) observation by Atacama
Cosmology Telescope (ACT). Pole inflation is known to provide a unified
description of attractor models that they can generate a flat plateau for
inflation given a general potential. Recent ACT observation suggests that the
constraint on the scalar spectral index $n_s$ at CMB scale may be shifted to a
larger value than the predictions in the Starobinsky model, the Higgs
inflation, and the $\alpha$-attractor model, which motivates us to consider the
modification of the pole inflation. We find that if we regularize the second
order pole in the kinetic term such that the kinetic term becomes regular for
all field range, we can generally increase $n_s$ because the potential in the
large field regime will be lifted. We have explicitly demonstrated that this
type of regularized pole inflation can naturally arise from the Einstein-Cartan
formalism, and the inflationary predictions are consistent with the latest ACT
data without spoiling the success of the $\alpha$-attractor models.

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: 本文提出了在大型光谱巡天中量化内禀排列的估计器，通过优化视线积分范围和权重，提高了测量效率，并减少了对红移空间畸变的敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内禀排列的测量对弱透镜和宇宙学应用至关重要，但传统方法对红移空间畸变敏感，需要更高效的估计器。

Method: 通过动态调整视线积分范围（Πmax）和引入基于形状投影和红移空间畸变的权重，优化了估计器设计。

Result: 模拟实验表明，新估计器在1-100 Mpc/h的横向分离范围内表现出更高的信噪比，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 提出的估计器改进了内禀排列的测量，为宇宙学应用提供了更可靠的约束。

Abstract: We present estimators for quantifying intrinsic alignments in large
spectroscopic surveys that efficiently capture line-of-sight (LOS) information
while being relatively insensitive to redshift-space distortions (RSD). We
demonstrate that changing the LOS integration range, {\Pi}max, as a function of
transverse separation outperforms the conventional choice of a single {\Pi}max
value. This is further improved by replacing the flat {\Pi}max cut with a LOS
weighting based on shape projection and RSD. Although these estimators
incorporate additional LOS information, they are projected correlations that
exhibit signal-to-noise ratios comparable to 3D correlation functions, such as
the IA quadrupole. Using simulations from Abacus Summit, we evaluate these
estimators and provide recommended {\Pi}max values and weights for projected
separations of 1 - 100 Mpc/h. These will improve measurements of intrinsic
alignments in large cosmological surveys and the constraints they provide for
both weak lensing and direct cosmological applications.

Abstract: The natural environment of the Earth can act as a sensitive detector for dark
matter in ultralight axions. When axions with masses between
$1\times10^{-15}\,{\rm eV}$ and $1\times10^{-13}\,{\rm eV}$ pass through the
Earth, they interact with the global geomagnetic field, generating
electromagnetic (EM) waves in the extremely low-frequency range
($0.3$--$30\,{\rm Hz}$) through axion-photon coupling. This paper is one of a
series of companion papers for~\cite{Taruya:2025zql}, focusing on the data
analysis method and search results for an axion signal. Utilizing the
theoretical predictions of axion-induced EM spectra from a companion study, we
analyzed long-term observational data of terrestrial magnetic fields in this
frequency band to search for axion-induced signals. Our analysis identified 65
persistent signal candidates with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 3.
Aside from these candidates, we placed a new upper bound on the axion-photon
coupling parameter, significantly refining the previous constraint from CAST by
at most two orders of magnitude down to $g_{a\gamma} \lesssim 4\times10^{-13}
\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for the axion mass around $3 \times 10^{-14}\,{\rm eV}$.

Abstract: Neutron stars offer powerful astrophysical laboratories to probe the
properties of dark matter. Gradual accumulation of heavy, non-annihilating dark
matter in neutron stars can lead to the formation of comparable-mass black
holes, and non-detection of gravitational waves from mergers of such low-mass
black holes can constrain such dark matter interactions with nucleons. These
constraints, though dependent on the currently uncertain binary neutron star
merger rate density, are significantly more stringent than those from direct
detection experiments and provide some of the strongest limits on heavy,
non-annihilating dark matter interactions. Additionally, dark matter with
baryon number-violating interactions can induce excess heating in cold neutron
stars and is thus significantly constrained by thermal observations of cold
neutron stars.

Abstract: We analyze the damping of inflationary gravitational waves (GW) that re-enter
the Hubble horizon before or during a post-inflationary era dominated by a
meta-stable, right-handed neutrino (RHN), whose out-of-equilibrium decay
releases entropy. Within a minimal type-I seesaw extension of the Standard
Model (SM), we explore the conditions under which the population of thermally
produced RHNs remain long-lived and cause a period of matter-domination. We
find that the suppression of the GW spectrum occurs above a characteristic
frequency determined by the RHN mass and active-sterile mixing. For RHN masses
in the range $0.1$ - $10$ GeV and mixing $10^{-12} \lesssim |V_{eN}|^2 \lesssim
10^{-5}$, we estimate such characteristic frequencies and the signal-to-noise
ratio to assess the detection prospects in GW observatories such as THEIA,
$\mu$-ARES, LISA, BBO and ET. We find complementarity between GW signals and
laboratory searches in SHiP, DUNE and LEGEND-1000. Notably, RHN masses of $0.2$
- $2$ GeV and mixing $10^{-10} \lesssim |V_{eN}|^2 \lesssim 10^{-7}$ are
testable in both laboratory experiments and GW observations. Additionally, GW
experiments can probe the canonical seesaw regime of light neutrino mass
generation, a region largely inaccessible to laboratory searches.

Abstract: Multi natural inflation is studied in the context of warm inflation. We study
the warm multi natural inflation scenario with both linear and cubic
dissipation coefficients. The model is motivated by axion-like inflation models
with coupling to non-Abelian gauge fields through a dimension five coupling and
dissipation originating from sphaleron decay in a thermal bath. Both cases of
dissipation coefficients can be compatible with current observations. In the
case of the cubic dissipation coefficient, we find that the curvature
perturbation starts to grow suddenly when a transition from a weak dissipation
to a strong dissipation regime occurs at the later stage of the inflation. We
also show that such rapid growth of the curvature perturbation on small scales
gives rise to abundant scalar induced gravitational waves, which may be
detectable with future gravitational wave detectors such as DECIGO and ET. On
the other hand, there are also other parameter regions of the model, in the
warm inflation regime of weak to strong dissipation and with sub-Planckian
axion decay constant, that can lead to overproduction of primordial black holes
on small scales, which are constrained by nucleosynthesis bounds, thus ruling
out the model in this region of parameters.

Abstract: Multiphase gas can be found in many astrophysical environments, such as
galactic outflows, stellar wind bubbles, and the circumgalactic medium, where
the interplay between turbulence, cooling, and viscosity can significantly
influence gas dynamics and star formation processes. We investigate the role of
viscosity in modulating turbulence and radiative cooling in turbulent radiative
mixing layers (TRMLs). In particular, we aim to determine how different amounts
of viscosity affect the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI), turbulence
evolution, and the efficiency of gas mixing and cooling. Using idealized 2D
numerical setups, we compute the critical viscosity required to suppress the
KHI in shear flows characterized by different density contrasts and Mach
numbers. These results are then used in a 3D shear layer setup to explore the
impact of viscosity on cooling efficiency and turbulence across different
cooling regimes. We find that the critical viscosity follows the expected
dependence on overdensity and Mach number. Our viscous TRMLs simulations show
different behaviors in the weak and strong cooling regimes. In the weak cooling
regime, viscosity has a strong impact, resulting in laminar flows and breaking
previously established inviscid relations between cooling and turbulence
(albeit leaving the total luminosity unaffected). However, in the strong
cooling regime, when cooling timescales are shorter than viscous timescales,
key scaling relations in TRMLs remain largely intact. In this regime -- which
must hold for gas to remain multiphase -- radiative losses dominate, and the
system effectively behaves as non-viscous regardless of the actual level of
viscosity. Our findings have direct implications for both the interpretation of
observational diagnostics and the development of subgrid models in large-scale
simulations.

without needing to resolve individual galaxies. We predict the intensity and
sources of hydrogen H$\alpha$ emission, dominated by radiative recombination
following ionization by UV from the same massive stars that caused
reionization, down to redshift 4.6, using the largest fully-coupled,
radiation-hydro simulation of galaxy formation and reionization to date, Cosmic
Dawn (CoDa) III. We compute the mean intensity and Voxel Intensity Distribution
(VID) vs. redshift, including the relative contributions of galaxies and IGM.
This will provide mock data to guide and interpret LIM experiments such as
NASA's SPHEREx and proposed Cosmic Dawn Intensity Mapper (CDIM).

Abstract: We present radial density profiles, as traced by luminous galaxies and dark
matter particles, for voids in eleven snapshots of the \texttt{TNG300}
simulation. The snapshots span 11.65~Gyr of cosmic time, corresponding to the
redshift range $0 \le z \le 3$. Using the comoving galaxy fields, voids were
identified via a well-tested, watershed transformation-based algorithm. Voids
were defined to be underdense regions that are unlikely to have arisen from
Poisson noise, resulting in the selection of $\sim100-200$ of the largest
underdense regions in each snapshot. At all redshifts, the radial density
profiles as traced by both the galaxies and the dark matter resemble inverse
top-hat functions. However, details of the functions (particularly the
underdensities of the innermost regions and the overdensities of the ridges)
evolve considerably more for the dark matter density profiles than for the
galaxy density profiles. At all redshifts, a linear relationship between the
galaxy and dark matter density profiles exists, and the slope of the
relationship is similar to the bias estimates for \texttt{TNG300} snapshots.
Lastly, we identify distinct environments in which voids can exist, defining
``void-in-void" and ``void-in-cloud" populations (i.e., voids that reside in
larger underdense or overdense regions, respectively) and we investigate ways
in which the relative densities of dark matter and galaxies in the interiors
and ridges of these structures vary as a function of void environment.

Abstract: (Aims) Hot Dust Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs) are a population of
hyper-luminous, heavily obscured quasars. Although nuclear obscurations close
to Compton-thick are typical, a fraction show blue UV spectral energy
distributions consistent with unobscured quasar activity, albeit two orders of
magnitude fainter than expected from their mid-IR luminosity. The origin of the
UV emission in these Blue excess Hot DOGs (BHDs) has been linked to scattered
light from the central engine. Here we study the properties of the UV emission
in the BHD WISE J020446.13-050640.8 (W0204-0506). (Methods) We use imaging
polarization observations in the $R_{\rm Special}$ band obtained with the FORS2
instrument at VLT. We compare these data with radiative transfer simulations to
constrain the characteristics of the scattering material. (Results) We find a
spatially integrated polarization fraction of $24.7\pm 0.7$%, confirming the
scattered-light nature of the UV emission of W0204-0506. The source is
spatially resolved in the observations and we find a gradient in polarization
fraction and angle that is aligned with the extended morphology of the source
found in HST/WFC3 imaging. A dusty, conical polar outflow starting at the AGN
sublimation radius with a half-opening angle $\lesssim 50~\rm deg$ viewed at an
inclination $\gtrsim 45~\rm deg$ can reproduce the observed polarization
fraction if the dust is graphite-rich. We find that the gas mass and outflow
velocity are consistent with the range of values found for [OIII] outflows
through spectroscopy in other Hot DOGs, though it is unclear whether the
outflow is energetic enough to affect the long-term evolution of the host
galaxy. Our study highlights the unique potential for polarization imaging to
study dusty quasar outflows, providing complementary constraints to those
obtained through traditional spectroscopic studies.

Abstract: Cosmic rays are often modeled as charged particles. This allows their
non-ballistic propagation in magnetized structures to be captured. In certain
situations, a neutral cosmic ray component can arise. For example, cosmic ray
neutrons are produced in considerable numbers through hadronic pp and p$\gamma$
interactions. At ultrahigh energies, the decay timescales of these neutrons is
dilated, allowing them to traverse distances on the scale of galactic and
cosmological structures. Unlike charged cosmic rays, neutrons are not deflected
by magnetic fields. They propagate ballistically at the speed of light in
straight lines. The presence of a neutral baryonic cosmic ray component formed
in galaxies, clusters and cosmological filaments can facilitate the escape and
leakage of cosmic rays from magnetic structures that would otherwise confine
them. We show that, by allowing confinement breaking, the formation of
cosmic-ray neutrons by high-energy hadronic interactions in large scale
astrophysical structures can modify the exchange of ultra high-energy particles
across magnetic interfaces between galaxies, clusters, cosmological filaments
and voids.
