Recent methods have introduced guidance\nvia diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we\nextend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable\nPrompt-Aware R\\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for\nprompt-aware diversity guidance.

Earlier methods rely on dense\nBEV features, which are costly to construct. More recent works explore sparse\nquery-based detection. However, they still require a large number of queries\nand can become expensive to run when more video frames are used. In this paper,\nwe propose DySS, a novel method that employs state-space learning and dynamic\nqueries.

In order to\nencourage the model to better capture the underlying motion and correspondence\ninformation, we introduce auxiliary tasks of future prediction and masked\nreconstruction to better train the SSM. The state of the SSM then provides an\ninformative yet efficient summarization of the scene.

This is suboptimal because resampling can\nintroduce artifacts due to interpolation. To address this, we present\nRealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic method for image registration. RKM is\nan extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a\nnetwork to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after\nwhich a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation\nthat aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM\noutputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we\nleverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that\nencodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates. By\ntransforming keypoints into real-world space and integrating this into the\ntraining process, RKM effectively enables the extracted keypoints to be\nresolution-agnostic.

Establishing a robust theoretical\nfoundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore\nbecome an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable\ndirections have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image\ndenoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks\nstill lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural\ncomponents that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and\nsubsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by\ndeveloping a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not\nonly the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such\nas positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later\nvariants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts\nbuilding upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce\ntwo independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our\nprimary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image\nprocessing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy\nand robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and\nvision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\uff09\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6539\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6210\u529f\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u672a\u80fd\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u5176\u67b6\u6784\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53ca\u5176\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Conventional methods\nface challenges due to sparse data, algorithmic complexity, and high\ncomputational costs, while increasing usage of machine learning (ML) method\nremains limited to reconstruction problems at the sea surface and local\nregions, struggling with issues like cloud occlusion. To address these\nlimitations, this paper proposes ReconMOST, a data-driven guided diffusion\nmodel framework for multi-layer sea temperature reconstruction. Specifically,\nwe first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model using a large collection of\nhistorical numerical simulation data, enabling the model to attain physically\nconsistent distribution patterns of ocean temperature fields. During the\ngeneration phase, sparse yet high-accuracy in-situ observational data are\nutilized as guidance points for the reverse diffusion process, generating\naccurate reconstruction results. Importantly, in regions lacking direct\nobservational data, the physically consistent spatial distribution patterns\nlearned during pre-training enable implicitly guided and physically plausible\nreconstructions. Our method extends ML-based SST reconstruction to a global,\nmulti-layer setting, handling over 92.5% missing data while maintaining\nreconstruction accuracy, spatial resolution, and superior generalization\ncapability. We pre-train our model on CMIP6 numerical simulation data and\nconduct guided reconstruction experiments on CMIP6 and EN4 analysis data. The\nresults of mean squared error (MSE) values achieve 0.049 on guidance, 0.680 on\nreconstruction, and 0.633 on total, respectively, demonstrating the\neffectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.

Combined with\nmeticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves\ncompetitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We\nevaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it\ndemonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on\nGenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits\nrobust generative capabilities.

In the domain of natural images, numerous transfer-based\nadversarial attack methods have been studied. However, HSIs differ from natural\nimages due to their high-dimensional and rich spectral information. Current\nresearch on HSI adversarial examples remains limited and faces challenges in\nfully utilizing the structural and feature information of images. To address\nthese issues, this paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability\nof the adversarial examples for HSI classification models. First, while keeping\nthe image structure unchanged, the proposed method randomly divides the image\ninto blocks in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Then, various\ntransformations are applied on a block by block basis to increase input\ndiversity and mitigate overfitting. Second, a feature distancing loss targeting\nintermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the\namplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial\nexamples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the\nauxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the\ntrue class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by\nthe proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on\ntwo public HSI datasets.

Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to\nthe semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract\ncues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the\nphysical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple\nplausible dance interpretations.

Existing text-to-texture synthesis\napproaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate\nimages and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,\nthese approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across\nviewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized\ntextures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the\nautoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the\npredefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the\nobject's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized\nfrom different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In\nTexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that\nrepeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within\nthe diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on\nthese resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a\nfew training images restricts the model's original ability to generate\nhigh-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an\nperformance preservation loss to mitigate this issue.

In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn\nextremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,\nwhere both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.\n  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual\nInterpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for\nimage recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures\nlong-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable\nprototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.\nAdditionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution\ninput processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across\nscales.\n  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four\ndatasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.\nMoreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the\nlearned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant.

Quantization is a key\ntechnique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,\nPost-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video\nmatting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal\ncoherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general\nPTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the\nbest of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our\ncontributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines\nblock-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization\nand local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization\nparameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine\nCalibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative\nstatistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer\neffects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks\nup to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages\ntemporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing\nthe model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and\nultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit\nquantization.

Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss\nwhich use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text\noffset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is\nsimilar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of\nwords is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the\noffset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM\nmethods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between\nimage offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality\ndegrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by\nthe offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform\nan empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image\noffset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.\nOur important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is\ncorrelated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset\nmisalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our\nsecond contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)\nwhich is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image\nquality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative,\nquantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate\nthe proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance.

In this paper, we go beyond attention or\nsimilarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,\nwhich maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define\nthe conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the\ninstruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal\npoint process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected\nsubset.

In this work, we propose a novel learning-based\ndensity-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.\nSpecifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and\ngeometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the\ntransformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates\nsuperior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior\nmethods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can\nbe easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it\ngeneralizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the\nmodel architecture or loss formulation. Altogether, our work opens up new\npossibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps\nfor practical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5747\u8861\u6620\u5c04\u6846\u67b6\uff08LDEM\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u91cd\u53e0\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c2D\u52303D\u6269\u5c55\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5747\u8861\u6620\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3001\u6781\u7aef\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u91cd\u53e0\u4f2a\u5f71\u4ee5\u53ca\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece2D\u6269\u5c55\u52303D\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u786e\u4fdd\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5747\u5300\u6027\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u89c4\u5219\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u65b9\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u3002", "result": "LDEM\u5728\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5747\u8861\u548c\u53cc\u5c04\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u65e0\u7f1d\u6269\u5c55\u52303D\u3002", "conclusion": "LDEM\u4e3a\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5747\u8861\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose the Harmonized Frequency\nFusion Network (HFF-Net), which rethinks brain tumor segmentation from a\nfrequency-domain perspective.

To access a\nfull global view of tools, most applications adopt eye-to-hand configuration or\neye-to-hand/eye-in-hand cooperation configuration in an automated manufacturing\nenvironment. Most research papers mainly put efforts into developing control\nand observation architectures in various scenarios, but few of them have\ndiscussed the importance of the camera's location in eye-to-hand configuration.\nIn a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary\nsignificantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects\nof environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image\nshot at different locations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the\ncamera's moving policy so that it explores the camera workspace and searches\nfor the optimal location where the images' noise level is minimized. Also, this\nalgorithm ensures the camera ends up at a suboptimal (if the optimal one is\nunreachable) location among the locations already searched, with limited energy\navailable for moving the camera.

Specifically, we achieve\nreal-time estimation of RG'G and RBS under two relaxed assumptions: i) the\nmatrices change negligibly in a short time window; ii) the human movements/IMU\nreadings are diverse in such a time window. Intuitively, the first assumption\nreduces the number of candidate matrices, and the second assumption provides\ndiverse constraints, which greatly reduces the solution space and allows for\naccurate estimation of RG'G and RBS from a short history of IMU readings in\nreal time. To achieve this, we created synthetic datasets of paired RG'G, RBS\nmatrices and IMU readings, and learned their mappings using a Transformer-based\nmodel.

We propose a two-stage\npipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net\nbased segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping\nsignals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the\nprimary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into\na time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an\nadaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG\nformats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our\napproach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained\nsegmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior\nperformance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both\nnon-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping\nsignals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson\nCorrelation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,\nrespectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method\nachieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the\nbaseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to\nsignificantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of\nsignal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion\nof analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research\nand clinical applications.

Previous methods can be broadly\nclassified into three categories: convolutional neural network (CNN) based,\nTransformer based, and hybrid architectures that combine both. However, each of\nthem has its own limitations, such as restricted receptive fields in CNNs or\nthe computational overhead caused by the quadratic complexity of Transformers.\nRecently, the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model has emerged as a\npromising alternative for various vision tasks, offering strong long-range\nmodeling capabilities with linear computational complexity.

In this paper, we propose Med-URWKV, a pure\nRWKV-based architecture built upon the U-Net framework, which incorporates\nImageNet-based pretraining to further explore the potential of RWKV in medical\nimage segmentation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, Med-URWKV is the first\npure RWKV segmentation model in the medical field that can directly reuse a\nlarge-scale pre-trained VRWKV encoder. Experimental results on seven datasets\ndemonstrate that Med-URWKV achieves comparable or even superior segmentation\nperformance compared to other carefully optimized RWKV models trained from\nscratch.

Training-free methods like diffusion\nposterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic\nalgorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough,\ne.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques\nveer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work,\nwe devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism\nand reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\\hat{x}$\nproduced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the\nsolution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting\nfrom $\\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for\nDPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box\nin-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art\nbaselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these\nbaselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We\ncomplement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data\ndistributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the\ncandidate solution closer to the data manifold.

Motivated by this principle, we introduce EyeRobot, a robotic system\nwith gaze behavior that emerges from the need to complete real-world tasks. We\ndevelop a mechanical eyeball that can freely rotate to observe its surroundings\nand train a gaze policy to control it using reinforcement learning. We\naccomplish this by first collecting teleoperated demonstrations paired with a\n360 camera. This data is imported into a simulation environment that supports\nrendering arbitrary eyeball viewpoints, allowing episode rollouts of eye gaze\non top of robot demonstrations. We then introduce a BC-RL loop to train the\nhand and eye jointly: the hand (BC) agent is trained from rendered eye\nobservations, and the eye (RL) agent is rewarded when the hand produces correct\naction predictions. In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks\ntowards regions which allow the hand to complete the task. EyeRobot implements\na foveal-inspired policy architecture allowing high resolution with a small\ncompute budget, which we find also leads to the emergence of more stable\nfixation as well as improved ability to track objects and ignore distractors.\nWe evaluate EyeRobot on five panoramic workspace manipulation tasks requiring\nmanipulation in an arc surrounding the robot arm. Our experiments suggest\nEyeRobot exhibits hand-eye coordination behaviors which effectively facilitate\nmanipulation over large workspaces with a single camera.
