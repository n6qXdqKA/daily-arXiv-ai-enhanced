However, sonar\nimages are characterized by lower resolution and sparser features compared to\noptical images, which seriously degrades the performance of object detection.To\naddress these challenges, we specifically propose a Detection Transformer\n(DETR) architecture optimized with a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approach\ncalled NAS-DETR for object detection in sonar images. First, an improved\nZero-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method based on the maximum entropy\nprinciple is proposed to identify a real-time, high-representational-capacity\nCNN-Transformer backbone for sonar image detection. This method enables the\nefficient discovery of high-performance network architectures with low\ncomputational and time overhead. Subsequently, the backbone is combined with a\nFeature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a deformable attention-based Transformer\ndecoder to construct a complete network architecture. This architecture\nintegrates various advanced components and training schemes to enhance overall\nperformance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this architecture achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on two Representative datasets, while maintaining\nminimal overhead in real-time efficiency and computational complexity.\nFurthermore, correlation analysis between the key parameters and differential\nentropy-based fitness function is performed to enhance the interpretability of\nthe proposed framework.

We propose a framework for symbolic rule extraction from ViTs by\nintroducing a sparse concept layer inspired by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). This\nlinear layer operates on attention-weighted patch representations and learns a\ndisentangled, binarized representation in which individual neurons activate for\nhigh-level visual concepts. To encourage interpretability, we apply a\ncombination of L1 sparsity, entropy minimization, and supervised contrastive\nloss. These binarized concept activations are used as input to the FOLD-SE-M\nalgorithm, which generates a rule-set in the form of logic programs. Our method\nachieves a 5.14% better classification accuracy than the standard ViT while\nenabling symbolic reasoning. Crucially, the extracted rule-set is not merely\npost-hoc but acts as a logic-based decision layer that operates directly on the\nsparse concept representations. The resulting programs are concise and\nsemantically meaningful. This work is the first to extract executable logic\nprograms from ViTs using sparse symbolic representations.

Recent studies on Class-Conditional Distribution\nBalancing (CCDB) reveal that spurious correlations often stem from mismatches\nbetween the class-conditional and marginal distributions of bias attributes.\nThey achieve promising results by addressing this issue through simple\ndistribution matching in a bias-agnostic manner. However, CCDB approximates\neach distribution using a single Gaussian, which is overly simplistic and\nrarely holds in real-world applications. To address this limitation, we propose\na novel method called Bias Exploration via Overfitting (BEO), which captures\neach distribution in greater detail by modeling it as a mixture of latent\ngroups. Building on these group-level descriptions, we introduce a fine-grained\nvariant of CCDB, termed FG-CCDB, which performs more precise distribution\nmatching and balancing within each group. Through group-level reweighting,\nFG-CCDB learns sample weights from a global perspective, achieving stronger\nmitigation of spurious correlations without incurring substantial storage or\ncomputational costs.

At its design core, we compose an autoregressive (AR) prior --\nmirroring the causal structure of language -- into visual tokens by using the\nreverse diffusion process of image generation. The AR property makes Selftok\nfundamentally distinct from traditional spatial tokens in the following two key\nways: - Selftok offers an elegant and minimalist approach to unify diffusion\nand AR for vision-language models (VLMs): By representing images with Selftok\ntokens, we can train a VLM using a purely discrete autoregressive architecture\n-- like that in LLMs -- without requiring additional modules or training\nobjectives. - We theoretically show that the AR prior satisfies the Bellman\nequation, whereas the spatial prior does not. Therefore, Selftok supports\nreinforcement learning (RL) for visual generation with effectiveness comparable\nto that achieved in LLMs. Besides the AR property, Selftok is also a SoTA\ntokenizer that achieves a favorable trade-off between high-quality\nreconstruction and compression rate. We use Selftok to build a pure AR VLM for\nboth visual comprehension and generation tasks. Impressively, without using any\ntext-image training pairs, a simple policy gradient RL working in the visual\ntokens can significantly boost the visual generation benchmark, surpassing all\nthe existing models by a large margin. Therefore, we believe that Selftok\neffectively addresses the long-standing challenge that visual tokens cannot\nsupport effective RL. When combined with the well-established strengths of RL\nin LLMs, this brings us one step closer to realizing a truly multimodal LLM.\nProject Page: https://selftok-team.github.io/report/."}

However, its utility is often limited by missing or\ncorrupted data due to motion artifacts, magnetic field inhomogeneities, or\nfailed spectral fitting-especially in high resolution 3D acquisitions. To\naddress this, we propose the first deep learning-based, mask-free framework for\nestimating missing data in MRSI metabolic maps. Unlike conventional restoration\nmethods that rely on explicit masks to identify missing regions, our approach\nimplicitly detects and estimates these areas using contextual spatial features\nthrough 2D and 3D U-Net architectures. We also introduce a progressive training\nstrategy to enhance robustness under varying levels of data degradation. Our\nmethod is evaluated on both simulated and real patient datasets and\nconsistently outperforms traditional interpolation techniques such as cubic and\nlinear interpolation. The 2D model achieves an MSE of 0.002 and an SSIM of 0.97\nwith 20% missing voxels, while the 3D model reaches an MSE of 0.001 and an SSIM\nof 0.98 with 15% missing voxels. Qualitative results show improved fidelity in\nestimating missing data, particularly in metabolically heterogeneous regions\nand ventricular regions.

In this paper, we propose a more efficient\nalternative that approaches the problem from the perspective of parallel\ndenoising. We show that full backpropagation throughout the entire generation\nprocess is unnecessary. The downstream metrics can be optimized by retaining\nthe computational graph of only one step during generation, thus providing a\nshortcut for gradient propagation. The resulting method, which we call Shortcut\nDiffusion Optimization (SDO), is generic, high-performance, and computationally\nlightweight, capable of optimizing all parameter types in diffusion sampling.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of SDO on several real-world tasks, including\ncontrolling generation by optimizing latent and aligning the DMs by fine-tuning\nnetwork parameters. Compared to full backpropagation, our approach reduces\ncomputational costs by $\\sim 90\\%$ while maintaining superior performance. Code\nis available at https://github.com/deng-ai-lab/SDO."}
