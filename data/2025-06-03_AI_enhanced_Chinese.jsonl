Yet,\nexisting work on procedure-aware video representations fails to explicitly\nlearned the state changes (scene transformations). In this work, we study\nprocedure-aware video representation learning by incorporating state-change\ndescriptions generated by LLMs as supervision signals for video encoders.\nMoreover, we generate state-change counterfactuals that simulate hypothesized\nfailure outcomes, allowing models to learn by imagining the unseen ``What if''\nscenarios. This counterfactual reasoning facilitates the model's ability to\nunderstand the cause and effect of each step in an activity. To verify the\nprocedure awareness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on\nprocedure-aware tasks, including temporal action segmentation, error detection,\nand more.

VeBrain reformulates robotic control into common\ntext-based MLLM tasks in the 2D visual space, thus unifying the objectives and\nmapping spaces of different tasks.

In this work, we propose to\nobtain video LLMs whose reasoning steps are grounded in, and explicitly refer\nto, the relevant video frames. For this, we first create CoF-Data, a large\ndataset of diverse questions, answers, and corresponding frame-grounded\nreasoning traces about both natural and synthetic videos, spanning various\ntopics and tasks. Then, we fine-tune existing video LLMs on this\nchain-of-frames (CoF) data.

We show that our models based on CoF are\nable to generate chain-of-thoughts that accurately refer to the key frames to\nanswer the given question. This, in turn, leads to improved performance across\nmultiple video understanding benchmarks, for example, surpassing leading video\nLLMs on Video-MME, MVBench, and VSI-Bench, and notably reducing the\nhallucination rate.

We leverage this insight to\nguide on-manifold sampling using perceptual features and input measurements.\nSpecifically, we propose Perceptual Manifold Guidance (PMG), an algorithm that\nutilizes pretrained latent diffusion models and perceptual quality features to\nobtain perceptually consistent multi-scale and multi-timestep feature maps from\nthe denoising U-Net. We empirically demonstrate that these hyperfeatures\nexhibit high correlation with human perception in IQA tasks.

Meanwhile, the image encoder\nis usually frozen due to the absence of explicit supervision in TTA scenarios.\nWe identify a critical limitation in this paradigm: While test-time images\noften exhibit distribution shifts from training data, existing methods\npersistently freeze the image encoder due to the absence of explicit\nsupervision during adaptation. This practice overlooks the image encoder's\ncrucial role in bridging distribution shift between training and test. To\naddress this challenge, we propose SSAM (Self-Supervised Association Modeling),\na new TTA framework that enables dynamic encoder refinement through dual-phase\nassociation learning.

The localization of\npoint targets constitutes a fundamental problem in optical experimental\nmechanics, with extensive applications in various missions of UAVs. Localizing\nmoving targets is crucial for analyzing their motion characteristics and\ndynamic properties. Reconstructing the trajectories of points from asynchronous\ncameras is a significant challenge. It encompasses two coupled sub-problems:\ntrajectory reconstruction and camera synchronization. Present methods typically\naddress only one of these sub-problems individually. This paper proposes a 3D\ntrajectory reconstruction method for point targets based on asynchronous\ncameras, simultaneously solving both sub-problems. Firstly, we extend the\ntrajectory intersection method to asynchronous cameras to resolve the\nlimitation of traditional triangulation that requires camera synchronization.\nSecondly, we develop models for camera temporal information and target motion,\nbased on imaging mechanisms and target dynamics characteristics. The parameters\nare optimized simultaneously to achieve trajectory reconstruction without\naccurate time parameters. Thirdly, we optimize the camera rotations alongside\nthe camera time information and target motion parameters, using tighter and\nmore continuous constraints on moving points. The reconstruction accuracy is\nsignificantly improved, especially when the camera rotations are inaccurate.\nFinally, the simulated and real-world experimental results demonstrate the\nfeasibility and accuracy of the proposed method.

To address these gaps, we introduce CReFT-CAD, a two-stage\nfine-tuning paradigm that first employs a curriculum-driven reinforcement\nlearning stage with difficulty-aware rewards to build reasoning ability\nsteadily, and then applies supervised post-tuning to hone instruction following\nand semantic extraction. Complementing this, we release TriView2CAD, the first\nlarge-scale, open-source benchmark for orthographic projection reasoning,\ncomprising 200,000 synthetic and 3,000 real-world orthographic projections with\nprecise dimension annotations and six interoperable data modalities. We\nbenchmark leading VLMs on orthographic projection reasoning and demonstrate\nthat CReFT-CAD substantially improves reasoning accuracy and\nout-of-distribution generalizability in real-world scenarios, offering valuable\ninsights for advancing CAD reasoning research.", "AI": {"tldr": "CReFT-CAD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bfe\u7a0b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u540e\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u63d0\u5347CAD\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86TriView2CAD\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728CAD\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u5c3a\u5bf8\u548c\u9650\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "CReFT-CAD\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\uff1a\u8bfe\u7a0b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u540e\u8c03\u4f18\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03TriView2CAD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "CReFT-CAD\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "CReFT-CAD\u4e3aCAD\u63a8\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

For the\nregistration stage, we introduce an unsupervised diffusion-based framework\nguided by modality translation. Unlike existing methods that translate one\nmodality into another, we map both MR and US into a pseudo intermediate\nmodality. This design enables us to customize it to retain only\nregistration-critical features, greatly easing registration.

To address these challenges, we propose\nSeg2Any, a novel S2I framework built upon advanced multimodal diffusion\ntransformers (e.g. FLUX).

The regional semantic condition is\nintroduced by a Semantic Alignment Attention Mask, ensuring that generated\nentities adhere to their assigned text prompts. The high-frequency shape\ncondition, representing entity boundaries, is encoded as an Entity Contour Map\nand then introduced as an additional modality via multi-modal attention to\nguide image spatial structure. Second, to prevent attribute leakage across\nentities in multi-entity scenarios, we introduce an Attribute Isolation\nAttention Mask mechanism, which constrains each entity's image tokens to attend\nexclusively to themselves during image self-attention.

Extending text-to-image\ngeneration to volumetric Computed Tomography (CT) remains a significant\nchallenge, due to its high dimensionality, anatomical complexity, and the\nabsence of robust frameworks that align vision-language data in 3D medical\nimaging. Methods: We introduce a novel architecture for Text-to-CT generation\nthat combines a latent diffusion model with a 3D contrastive vision-language\npretraining scheme. Our approach leverages a dual-encoder CLIP-style model\ntrained on paired CT volumes and radiology reports to establish a shared\nembedding space, which serves as the conditioning input for generation. CT\nvolumes are compressed into a low-dimensional latent space via a pretrained\nvolumetric VAE, enabling efficient 3D denoising diffusion without requiring\nexternal super-resolution stages. Results: We evaluate our method on the\nCT-RATE dataset and conduct a comprehensive assessment of image fidelity,\nclinical relevance, and semantic alignment. Our model achieves competitive\nperformance across all tasks, significantly outperforming prior baselines for\ntext-to-CT generation.

Our framework employs\ntwo methods: (1) a sample-level explanation method that analyzes token\nimportance scores in individual images, and (2) a codebook-level explanation\nmethod that explores the entire codebook to find globally relevant tokens.\nExperimental results demonstrate CORTEX's efficacy in providing clear\nexplanations of token usage in the generative process, outperforming baselines\nacross multiple pretrained VQGMs. Besides enhancing VQGMs transparency, CORTEX\nis useful in applications such as targeted image editing and shortcut feature\ndetection.

Unfortunately such simplified\noptical systems usually suffer from severe aberrations, especially in off-axis\nregions, which can be difficult to correct purely in software.\n  In this paper we introduce Fovea Stacking, a new type of imaging system that\nutilizes emerging dynamic optical components called deformable phase plates\n(DPPs) for localized aberration correction anywhere on the image sensor. By\noptimizing DPP deformations through a differentiable optical model, off-axis\naberrations are corrected locally, producing a foveated image with enhanced\nsharpness at the fixation point - analogous to the eye's fovea. Stacking\nmultiple such foveated images, each with a different fixation point, yields a\ncomposite image free from aberrations. To efficiently cover the entire field of\nview, we propose joint optimization of DPP deformations under imaging budget\nconstraints. Due to the DPP device's non-linear behavior, we introduce a neural\nnetwork-based control model for improved alignment between simulation-hardware\nperformance.\n  We further demonstrated that for extended depth-of-field imaging, fovea\nstacking outperforms traditional focus stacking in image quality.

However, as these methods\ngenerally require extra training or in-context learning, their performance is\noften hindered by the limited availability of high-quality 3D data. In\ncontrast, modern text-to-image models learned from web-scale images can\ngenerate scenes with diverse, reliable spatial layouts and consistent, visually\nappealing styles. Our key insight is that instead of learning directly from 3D\nscenes, we can leverage generated 2D images as an intermediary to guide 3D\nsynthesis. In light of this, we introduce ArtiScene, a training-free automated\npipeline for scene design that integrates the flexibility of free-form\ntext-to-image generation with the diversity and reliability of 2D intermediary\nlayouts.\n  First, we generate 2D images from a scene description, then extract the shape\nand appearance of objects to create 3D models. These models are assembled into\nthe final scene using geometry, position, and pose information derived from the\nsame intermediary image. Being generalizable to a wide range of scenes and\nstyles, ArtiScene outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks by a large margin in\nlayout and aesthetic quality by quantitative metrics. It also averages a 74.89%\nwinning rate in extensive user studies and 95.07% in GPT-4o evaluation.

In this\npaper, we propose Hierarchical Self-Contrastive Rewarding (HSCR), a novel\napproach that addresses two critical challenges in Med-VLM alignment: 1)\nCost-effective generation of high-quality preference data; 2) Capturing nuanced\nand context-aware preferences for improved alignment. HSCR first leverages the\ninherent capability of Med-VLMs to generate dispreferred responses with higher\nsampling probability. By analyzing output logit shifts after visual token\ndropout, we identify modality-coupled tokens that induce misalignment and\nderive an implicit alignment reward function.

AD-SVFD operates by representing each\ngeometry as a weighted point cloud and models ambient space deformations as\nsolutions at unit time of ODEs, whose time-independent right-hand sides are\nexpressed through artificial neural networks. The model parameters are\noptimized by minimizing the Chamfer Distance between the deformed and reference\npoint clouds, while backward integration of the ODE defines the inverse\ntransformation. A distinctive feature of AD-SVFD is its auto-decoder structure,\nthat enables generalization across shape cohorts and favors efficient weight\nsharing. In particular, each anatomy is associated with a low-dimensional code\nthat acts as a self-conditioning field and that is jointly optimized with the\nnetwork parameters during training. At inference, only the latent codes are\nfine-tuned, substantially reducing computational overheads. Furthermore, the\nuse of implicit shape representations enables generative applications: new\nanatomies can be synthesized by suitably sampling from the latent space and\napplying the corresponding inverse transformations to the reference geometry.\nNumerical experiments, conducted on healthy aortic anatomies, showcase the\nhigh-quality results of AD-SVFD, which yields extremely accurate approximations\nat competitive computational costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "AD-SVFD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8840\u7ba1\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u914d\u51c6\u548c\u5408\u6210\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u793a\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528ODE\u89e3\u5efa\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6743\u91cd\u5171\u4eab\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8840\u7ba1\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u914d\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u7684\u5408\u6210\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u793a\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ODE\u89e3\u5efa\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u4f18\u5316Chamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u6743\u91cd\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5065\u5eb7\u4e3b\u52a8\u8109\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u914d\u51c6\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "AD-SVFD\u5728\u8840\u7ba1\u5f62\u72b6\u914d\u51c6\u548c\u5408\u6210\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

We use a\ntwo-stage framework: a text-instructed prior generation and vision-guided\nrefinement.

Building on this, we propose Ivy Explainable\nDetector (IVY-XDETECTOR), a unified AIGC detection and explainable architecture\nthat jointly performs explainable detection for both image and video content.\nOur unified vision-language model achieves state-of-the-art performance across\nmultiple image and video detection benchmarks, highlighting the significant\nadvancements enabled by our dataset and modeling framework.

Existing fine-tuning methods for conditional\ngeneration often rely on external encoders or architectural modifications,\nwhich demand large datasets and are typically restricted to spatially aligned\nconditioning, limiting flexibility and scalability. In this work, we introduce\nTemporal In-Context Fine-Tuning (TIC-FT), an efficient and versatile approach\nfor adapting pretrained video diffusion models to diverse conditional\ngeneration tasks. Our key idea is to concatenate condition and target frames\nalong the temporal axis and insert intermediate buffer frames with\nprogressively increasing noise levels. These buffer frames enable smooth\ntransitions, aligning the fine-tuning process with the pretrained model's\ntemporal dynamics. TIC-FT requires no architectural changes and achieves strong\nperformance with as few as 10-30 training samples.

This paper presents ECP-Mamba, an efficient\nframework integrating multi-scale self-supervised contrastive learning with a\nstate space model (SSM) backbone. Specifically, ECP-Mamba addresses annotation\nscarcity through a multi-scale predictive pretext task based on local-to-global\nfeature correspondences, which uses a simplified self-distillation paradigm\nwithout negative sample pairs. To enhance computational efficiency,the Mamba\narchitecture (a selective SSM) is first tailored for pixel-wise PolSAR\nclassification task by designing a spiral scan strategy. This strategy\nprioritizes causally relevant features near the central pixel, leveraging the\nlocalized nature of pixel-wise classification tasks. Additionally, the\nlightweight Cross Mamba module is proposed to facilitates complementary\nmulti-scale feature interaction with minimal overhead.

In\nthis work, we demonstrate that leveraging Marr's multi-stage theory-by first\nconstructing boundary and surface-level representations using perceptual\nconstructs from early visual processing stages and subsequently training for\nobject semantics-leads to 2x faster convergence on ResNet18, improved final\nrepresentations on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and object\nrecognition, and enhanced robustness and out-of-distribution capability.\nTogether, we propose a pretraining stage before the general contrastive\nrepresentation pretraining to further enhance the final representation quality\nand reduce the overall convergence time via inductive bias from human vision\nsystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eDavid Marr\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u6784\u5efa\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u8868\u9762\u7ea7\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u518d\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6536\u655b\u6162\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Marr\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5148\u6784\u5efa\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u8868\u9762\u7ea7\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "ResNet18\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad82\u500d\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8868\u793a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u524d\u52a0\u5165\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u6536\u655b\u65f6\u95f4\u3002"}}

In this paper, we\nintroduce Visual Sparse Steering (VS2), a lightweight, test-time method that\nguides vision models using steering vectors derived from sparse features\nlearned by top-$k$ Sparse Autoencoders without requiring contrastive data.\nSpecifically, VS2 surpasses zero-shot CLIP by 4.12% on CIFAR-100, 1.08% on\nCUB-200, and 1.84% on Tiny-ImageNet. We further propose VS2++, a\nretrieval-augmented variant that selectively amplifies relevant sparse features\nusing pseudo-labeled neighbors at inference time. With oracle positive/negative\nsets, VS2++ achieves absolute top-1 gains over CLIP zero-shot of up to 21.44%\non CIFAR-100, 7.08% on CUB-200, and 20.47% on Tiny-ImageNet. Interestingly, VS2\nand VS2++ raise per-class accuracy by up to 25% and 38%, respectively, showing\nthat sparse steering benefits specific classes by disambiguating visually or\ntaxonomically proximate categories rather than providing a uniform boost.\nFinally, to better align the sparse features learned through the SAE\nreconstruction task with those relevant for downstream performance, we propose\nPrototype-Aligned Sparse Steering (PASS). By incorporating a\nprototype-alignment loss during SAE training, using labels only during training\nwhile remaining fully test-time unsupervised, PASS consistently, though\nmodestly, outperforms VS2, achieving a 6.12% gain over VS2 only on CIFAR-100\nwith ViT-B/32.", "AI": {"tldr": "VS2\u548cVS2++\u662f\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u5f81\u5f15\u5bfc\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u96f6\u6837\u672cCLIP\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\u4f18\u5316\u3002PASS\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u5347\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u6216\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u5f15\u5bfc\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "VS2\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u5f81\u751f\u6210\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\uff1bVS2++\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u653e\u5927\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\uff1bPASS\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "VS2\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u96f6\u6837\u672cCLIP\uff0cVS2++\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0cPASS\u5728CIFAR-100\u4e0a\u6bd4VS2\u63d0\u53476.12%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a00\u758f\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u539f\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002"}}

Participants were tasked\nwith restoring real-captured images suffering from complex and unknown\ndegradations, where both perceptual quality and fidelity were critically\nevaluated. The challenge comprised two tracks: (1) the low-light joint\ndenoising and demosaicing (JDD) task, and (2) the image detail\nenhancement/generation task. Each track included two sub-tasks. The first\nsub-task involved paired data with available ground truth, enabling\nquantitative evaluation. The second sub-task dealt with real-world yet unpaired\nimages, emphasizing restoration efficiency and subjective quality assessed\nthrough a comprehensive user study. In total, the challenge attracted nearly\n300 registrations, with 51 teams submitting more than 600 results.

One intuitive solution, namely\nchain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of\nLLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on\nperformance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the\ninstructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for\nidentifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To\nthis end, we propose a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex\ninstructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling.

Unlike benign alignment, adversarial\nalignment involves two inherently conflicting preferences: visual consistency\nand attack effectiveness, which often lead to unstable optimization and reward\nhacking (e.g., reducing visual quality to improve attack success). To address\nthis, we propose APA (Adversary Preferences Alignment), a two-stage framework\nthat decouples conflicting preferences and optimizes each with differentiable\nrewards. In the first stage, APA fine-tunes LoRA to improve visual consistency\nusing rule-based similarity reward.

Recent studies have revealed the potential of\ntraining open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to unleash LLMs' reasoning\nability for improving navigation, and simultaneously mitigate the domain gap\nbetween LLMs' training corpus and the VLN task. However, these approaches\nprimarily adopt direct input-output mapping paradigms, causing the mapping\nlearning difficult and the navigational decisions unexplainable.\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) training is a promising way to improve both navigational\ndecision accuracy and interpretability, while the complexity of the navigation\ntask makes the perfect CoT labels unavailable and may lead to overfitting\nthrough pure CoT supervised fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a novel\nsElf-improving embodied reasoning framework for boosting LLM-based\nvision-language Navigation, dubbed EvolveNav. Our EvolveNav consists of two\nstages: (1) Formalized CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning, where we train the model\nwith formalized CoT labels to both activate the model's navigational reasoning\ncapabilities and increase the reasoning speed; (2) Self-Reflective\nPost-Training, where the model is iteratively trained with its own reasoning\noutputs as self-enriched CoT labels to enhance the supervision diversity.

To address these limitations, we propose HOSIG, a novel framework\nfor synthesizing full-body interactions through hierarchical scene perception.\nOur method decouples the task into three key components: 1) a scene-aware grasp\npose generator that ensures collision-free whole-body postures with precise\nhand-object contact by integrating local geometry constraints, 2) a heuristic\nnavigation algorithm that autonomously plans obstacle-avoiding paths in complex\nindoor environments via compressed 2D floor maps and dual-component spatial\nreasoning, and 3) a scene-guided motion diffusion model that generates\ntrajectory-controlled, full-body motions with finger-level accuracy by\nincorporating spatial anchors and dual-space classifier-free guidance.\nExtensive experiments on the TRUMANS dataset demonstrate superior performance\nover state-of-the-art methods.

By doing so, InfoMax enhances the overall\ninformativeness of the coreset. The information of individual samples is\nmeasured by importance scores, which capture their influence or difficulty in\nmodel learning. To quantify redundancy, we use pairwise sample similarities,\nbased on the premise that similar samples contribute similarly to the learning\nprocess. We formalize the coreset selection problem as a discrete quadratic\nprogramming (DQP) task, with the objective of maximizing the total information\ncontent, represented as the sum of individual sample contributions minus the\nredundancies introduced by similar samples within the coreset.

Active\nLearning (AL) aims to reduce this expense by strategically selecting the most\ninformative data for labeling and model training. Recent AL methods have\nexplored VLMs but have not leveraged publicly available open data, such as\nVLM's pretraining data. In this work, we leverage such data by retrieving\ntask-relevant examples to augment the task-specific examples. As expected,\nincorporating them significantly improves AL. Given that our method exploits\nopen-source VLM and open data, we refer to it as Active Learning with Open\nResources (ALOR). Additionally, most VLM-based AL methods use prompt tuning\n(PT) for model adaptation, likely due to its ability to directly utilize\npretrained parameters and the assumption that doing so reduces the risk of\noverfitting to limited labeled data. We rigorously compare popular adaptation\napproaches, including linear probing (LP), finetuning (FT), and contrastive\ntuning (CT). We reveal two key findings: (1) All adaptation approaches benefit\nfrom incorporating retrieved data, and (2) CT resoundingly outperforms other\napproaches across AL methods. Further analysis of retrieved data reveals a\nnaturally imbalanced distribution of task-relevant classes, exposing inherent\nbiases within the VLM. This motivates our novel Tail First Sampling (TFS)\nstrategy for AL, an embarrassingly simple yet effective method that prioritizes\nsampling data from underrepresented classes to label.

Existing works are limited by the degree of exploration they allow\ninside of a scene, i.e., produce streched-out and noisy artifacts when moving\nbeyond central or panoramic perspectives. To this end, we propose\nWorldExplorer, a novel method based on autoregressive video trajectory\ngeneration, which builds fully navigable 3D scenes with consistent visual\nquality across a wide range of viewpoints. We initialize our scenes by creating\nmulti-view consistent images corresponding to a 360 degree panorama. Then, we\nexpand it by leveraging video diffusion models in an iterative scene generation\npipeline. Concretely, we generate multiple videos along short, pre-defined\ntrajectories, that explore the scene in depth, including motion around objects.\nOur novel scene memory conditions each video on the most relevant prior views,\nwhile a collision-detection mechanism prevents degenerate results, like moving\ninto objects.

Fueled by recent advances in\nimplicit representations, the quality of the animatable avatars has achieved an\nunprecedented level by attaching the implicit representation to drivable human\ntemplate meshes. However, they usually fail to preserve the highest level of\ndetail, particularly apparent when the virtual camera is zoomed in and when\nrendering at 4K resolution and higher. We argue that this limitation stems from\ninaccurate surface tracking, specifically, depth misalignment and surface drift\nbetween character geometry and the ground truth surface, which forces the\ndetailed appearance model to compensate for geometric errors. To address this,\nwe propose a latent deformation model and supervising the 3D deformation of the\nanimatable character using guidance from foundational 2D video point trackers,\nwhich offer improved robustness to shading and surface variations, and are less\nprone to local minima than differentiable rendering. To mitigate the drift over\ntime and lack of 3D awareness of 2D point trackers, we introduce a cascaded\ntraining strategy that generates consistent 3D point tracks by anchoring point\ntracks to the rendered avatar, which ultimately supervises our avatar at the\nvertex and texel level. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we\nintroduce a novel dataset comprising five multi-view video sequences, each over\n10 minutes in duration, captured using 40 calibrated 6K-resolution cameras,\nfeaturing subjects dressed in clothing with challenging texture patterns and\nwrinkle deformations.

Unlike standard approaches that treat each species as an\nindependent category, TaxaDiffusion incorporates domain knowledge that many\nspecies exhibit strong visual similarities, with distinctions often residing in\nsubtle variations of shape, pattern, and color. To exploit these relationships,\nTaxaDiffusion progressively trains conditioned diffusion models across\ndifferent taxonomic levels -- starting from broad classifications such as Class\nand Order, refining through Family and Genus, and ultimately distinguishing at\nthe Species level. This hierarchical learning strategy first captures\ncoarse-grained morphological traits shared by species with common ancestors,\nfacilitating knowledge transfer before refining fine-grained differences for\nspecies-level distinction.

In the anisotropic formulation,\nuncertainties of the estimated relative rotations -- obtained via standard\ntwo-view optimization -- are propagated to the optimization of absolute\nrotations. The resulting semidefinite relaxations are able to recover global\nminima but scale poorly with the problem size. Local methods are fast and also\nadmit robust estimation but are sensitive to initialization. They usually\nemploy minimum spanning trees and therefore suffer from drift accumulation and\ncan get trapped in poor local minima. In this paper, we attempt to bridge the\ngap between optimality, robustness and efficiency of anisotropic rotation\naveraging. We analyze a family of block coordinate descent methods initially\nproposed to optimize the standard chordal distances, and derive a much simpler\nformulation and an anisotropic extension obtaining a fast general solver. We\nintegrate this solver into the extended anisotropic large-scale robust rotation\naveraging pipeline.

Existing methods predominantly adopt\neither attention-based flatten fusion or bird's eye view fusion through\ngeometric transformations.

In this paper, we introduce\nGaussianFusion, a Gaussian-based multi-sensor fusion framework for end-to-end\nautonomous driving. Our method employs intuitive and compact Gaussian\nrepresentations as intermediate carriers to aggregate information from diverse\nsensors.

The explicit features capture rich\nsemantic and spatial information about the traffic scene, while the implicit\nfeatures provide complementary cues beneficial for trajectory planning. To\nfully exploit rich spatial and semantic information in Gaussians, we design a\ncascade planning head that iteratively refines trajectory predictions through\ninteractions with Gaussians.

To address these challenges, this study aims to equip chatbots\nwith \"eyes and ears\" capable of more immersive interactions with humans. As\npart of this effort, we introduce a new multimodal conversation dataset,\nMultimodal Multi-Session Multi-Party Conversation ($M^3C$), and propose a novel\nmultimodal conversation model featuring multimodal memory retrieval. Our model,\ntrained on the $M^3C$, demonstrates the ability to seamlessly engage in\nlong-term conversations with multiple speakers in complex, real-world-like\nsettings, effectively processing visual and auditory inputs to understand and\nrespond appropriately.

This approach effectively\nguides the model to swiftly incorporate new knowledge while actively retaining\nits old knowledge. FL operates through a two-phase training process and can be\nseamlessly integrated into various CL methods, including replay, parameter\nregularization, distillation, and dynamic architecture techniques. In designing\nFL, we use two distinct knowledge bases: one to enhance plasticity and another\nto improve stability. FL ensures a more balanced model by utilizing both\nknowledge bases to regularize model updates. Theoretically, we analyze how the\nFL mechanism enhances the stability-plasticity balance. Empirically, FL\ndemonstrates tangible improvements over baseline methods within the same\ntraining budget. By integrating FL into at least one representative baseline\nfrom each CL category, we observed an average accuracy improvement of up to\n4.91% in Class-Incremental and 3.51% in Task-Incremental settings on standard\nimage classification benchmarks.

Moreover, it captures spatiotemporal dependencies between\ngenerators and loads by leveraging the physical structure of the power grid,\nallowing for deep integration of topological information across time and space.\nExtensive comparative and ablation studies show that DDA-PIGCN delivers strong\nperformance across several IEEE standard test cases (such as case9, case30, and\ncase300), achieving mean absolute errors (MAE) from 0.0011 to 0.0624 and\nconstraint satisfaction rates between 99.6% and 100%, establishing it as a\nreliable and efficient AC-OPF solver.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faDDA-PIGCN\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u89e3\u51b3AC-OPF\u4e2d\u7ea6\u675f\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAC-OPF\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u7ea6\u675f\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u53d8\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u989d\u5916\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u5982\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u7684\u6574\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDDA-PIGCN\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5c42\u786c\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u66f4\u65b0\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7535\u7f51\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u6355\u83b7\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aIEEE\u6807\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a0.0011\u81f30.0624\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u7387\u8fbe99.6%\u81f3100%\u3002", "conclusion": "DDA-PIGCN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u9760\u9ad8\u6548\u7684AC-OPF\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u7ea6\u675f\u5efa\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

The PDF at an arbitrary\nlocation can then be evaluated and sampled through interpolation. To train the\nnetwork, we maximize the similarity of the learned and target distributions. To\nreduce the variance of the gradient during optimizations and estimate the\nnormalization factor, we propose to cache the incoming radiance using an\nadditional network.

Despite significant progress in computer vision and artificial\nintelligence, current automated filming systems struggle with a fundamental\ntrade-off between mechanical execution and creative intent. Crucially, almost\nall previous works simplify the subject to a single point-ignoring its\norientation and true volume-severely limiting spatial awareness during filming.\nLensCraft solves this problem by mimicking the expertise of a professional\ncinematographer, using a data-driven approach that combines cinematographic\nprinciples with the flexibility to adapt to dynamic scenes in real time. Our\nsolution combines a specialized simulation framework for generating\nhigh-fidelity training data with an advanced neural model that is faithful to\nthe script while being aware of the volume and dynamic behavior of the subject.\nAdditionally, our approach allows for flexible control via various input\nmodalities, including text prompts, subject trajectory and volume, key points,\nor a full camera trajectory, offering creators a versatile tool to guide camera\nmovements in line with their vision.

Visual reprogramming (VR) is one instance for\nvision tasks that adds a trainable noise pattern (i.e., a visual prompt) to\ninput images to facilitate downstream classification. The existing VR\napproaches for CLIP train a single visual prompt using all descriptions of\ndifferent downstream classes. However, the limited learning capacity may result\nin (1) a failure to capture diverse aspects of the descriptions (e.g., shape,\ncolor, and texture), and (2) a possible bias toward less informative attributes\nthat do not help distinguish between classes. In this paper, we introduce a\ndecoupling-and-reweighting framework. Our decoupled visual prompts (DVP) are\noptimized using descriptions grouped by explicit causes (DVP-cse) or\nunsupervised clusters (DVP-cls). Then, we integrate the outputs of these visual\nprompts with a probabilistic reweighting matrix (PRM) that measures their\ncontributions to each downstream class. Theoretically, DVP lowers the empirical\nrisk bound. Experimentally, DVP outperforms baselines on average across 11\ndownstream datasets.

To address these\nchallenges, we introduce Sparsify, a sparse learning framework specifically\ndesigned for Music AVQA. It integrates three sparsification strategies into an\nend-to-end pipeline and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Music AVQA\ndatasets. In addition, it reduces training time by 28.32% compared to its fully\ntrained dense counterpart while maintaining accuracy, demonstrating clear\nefficiency gains.

These approaches typically rely on raw RGB data from the virtual scenes,\nwhich limits their ability to generalize to real-world environments due to\ndomain adaptation issues. To tackle this problem, in this work, we propose\nSEMNAV, a novel approach that leverages semantic segmentation as the main\nvisual input representation of the environment to enhance the agent's\nperception and decision-making capabilities. By explicitly incorporating\nhigh-level semantic information, our model learns robust navigation policies\nthat improve generalization across unseen environments, both in simulated and\nreal world settings.

However, they often fail to produce\nsemantically accurate results when the prompt contains concept combinations\nthat contradict their learned priors. We define this failure mode as contextual\ncontradiction, where one concept implicitly negates another due to entangled\nassociations learned during training. To address this, we propose a stage-aware\nprompt decomposition framework that guides the denoising process using a\nsequence of proxy prompts. Each proxy prompt is constructed to match the\nsemantic content expected to emerge at a specific stage of denoising, while\nensuring contextual coherence. To construct these proxy prompts, we leverage a\nlarge language model (LLM) to analyze the target prompt, identify\ncontradictions, and generate alternative expressions that preserve the original\nintent while resolving contextual conflicts. By aligning prompt information\nwith the denoising progression, our method enables fine-grained semantic\ncontrol and accurate image generation in the presence of contextual\ncontradictions.
