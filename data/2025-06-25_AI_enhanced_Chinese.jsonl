Existing approaches typically rely on feature\nextraction and data association across multiple point clouds; however, these\nprocesses are challenging to obtain global optimal solution in complex\nenvironments. In this paper, we introduce a novel correspondence-free multiview\npoint cloud registration method. Specifically, we represent the global map as a\ndepth map and leverage raw depth information to formulate a non-linear least\nsquares optimisation that jointly estimates poses of point clouds and the\nglobal map. Unlike traditional feature-based bundle adjustment methods, which\nrely on explicit feature extraction and data association, our method bypasses\nthese challenges by associating multi-frame point clouds with a global depth\nmap through their corresponding poses. This data association is implicitly\nincorporated and dynamically refined during the optimisation process.

This\npaper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD\nmotor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant\nfeatures are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence\neffect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and\nclinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project.\nPrincipal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based\nfeatures corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis\nhas allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect\nand hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to\ntrain machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society\nUnified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score.\nCompared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy\nin MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable\nquantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics.

Recent studies have typically focused on fusing\ncross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models.\nHowever, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high\nmemory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment.

This hierarchical\nwarping strategy enables robust free-viewpoint novel-view rendering from\nvarious embodied camera trajectories by attaching Gaussians to a complete\ncanonical foreground shape (\\eg, egocentric or third-person follow), which may\ninvolve substantial viewpoint changes and interactions between multiple actors.\nOur experiments demonstrate that \\ourmethod~ achieves superior reconstruction\nquality on challenging datasets while significantly reducing both training and\nrendering time compared to state-of-the-art monocular deformable NeRFs. These\nresults highlight a practical and scalable solution for EVS in real-world\nscenarios.

Integrating multiple fundus imaging modalities into a single\nfoundation model is valuable. However, in dynamic environments, data from\ndifferent modalities often arrive incrementally, necessitating continual\npre-training. To address this, we propose RetCoP, the first continual\nvision-language pre-training framework in the fundus domain, which\nincrementally integrates image and text features from different imaging\nmodalities into a single unified foundation model. To mitigate catastrophic\nforgetting in continual pre-training, we introduce a rehearsal strategy\nutilizing representative image-text pairs and an off-diagonal information\ndistillation approach. The former allows the model to revisit knowledge from\nprevious stages, while the latter explicitly preserves the alignment between\nimage and text representations.

However, existing approaches predominantly integrate formalin-fixed\nparaffin-embedded (FFPE) slides with genomic data, while neglecting the\navailability of other preservation slides, such as Fresh Froze (FF) slides.\nMoreover, as the high-resolution spatial nature of pathology data tends to\ndominate the cross-modality fusion process, it hinders effective multimodal\nfusion and leads to modality imbalance challenges between pathology and\ngenomics.

Recent years have seen impressive results from AI downscaling\nmodels, particularly diffusion models, which have attracted attention due to\ntheir ability to generate ensembles and overcome the smoothing problem common\nin other AI methods.

We first derive the modulation objectives and introduce a\nmodality confidence ratio, enabling the incorporation of prior knowledge into\nthe fusion process. Then, the feature masks, density and leakage losses are\nproposed to achieve the modulation objectives. Additionally, we introduce\nFT-Mamba, a powerful tabular encoder leveraging a selective mechanism to handle\nnoisy medical tabular data efficiently. Furthermore, interpretability studies\nare conducted to explore how different tabular encoders supervise the imaging\nmodality during contrastive pretraining for the first time. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that AMF-MedIT achieves a superior balance between\nmultimodal performance and data efficiency while showing strong adaptability to\nincomplete tabular data. Interpretability analysis also highlights FT-Mamba's\ncapabilities in extracting distinct tabular features and guiding the image\nencoder toward more accurate and flexible attention patterns.", "AI": {"tldr": "AMF-MedIT\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u533b\u7597\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u5236\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u56e0\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAMF\u6a21\u5757\u548cFT-Mamba\u8868\u683c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u5236\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7f6e\u4fe1\u6bd4\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5904\u7406\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eAMF-MedIT\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "AMF-MedIT\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u533b\u7597\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0cFT-Mamba\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Gradient integration is a building block in\nthe attribution analysis by integrating the gradients from multiple derived\nsamples to highlight the semantic features relevant to inferences. Such a\nbuilding block often combines with other information from visual models such as\nactivation or attention maps to form ultimate explanations. Yet, our\ntheoretical analysis demonstrates that the extent to the alignment of the\nsample distribution in gradient integration with respect to natural image\ndistribution gives a lower bound of explanation certainty.

Recent literature builds on a new generation of generative models to\nsynthesize highly realistic images for full-stack simulation. However, purely\nsynthetically generated scenes are not grounded in reality and have difficulty\nin inspiring confidence in the relevance of its outcomes. Editing models, on\nthe other hand, leverage source scenes from real driving logs, and enable the\nsimulation of different traffic layouts, behaviors, and operating conditions\nsuch as weather and time of day. While image editing is an established topic in\ncomputer vision, it presents fresh sets of challenges in driving simulation:\n(1) the need for cross-camera 3D consistency, (2) learning ``empty street\"\npriors from driving data with foreground occlusions, and (3) obtaining paired\nimage tuples of varied editing conditions while preserving consistent layout\nand geometry. To address these challenges, we propose SceneCrafter, a versatile\neditor for realistic 3D-consistent manipulation of driving scenes captured from\nmultiple cameras. We build on recent advancements in multi-view diffusion\nmodels, using a fully controllable framework that scales seamlessly to\nmulti-modality conditions like weather, time of day, agent boxes and\nhigh-definition maps.

This critical reliability\ngap poses substantial risks in safety-critical Artificial Intelligence (AI)\napplications, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and effective\ndetection methods. Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric\nhallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective,\noverlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We\ndevelop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset,\nwhich enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning\ncapabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances,\nscenes, and relations. Comprehensive evaluation with this new benchmark exposed\nmore visual vulnerabilities, particularly in the more challenging task of\nrelation reasoning.

Moreover, SAM2's performance in medical image\nsegmentation was limited by the domain shift issue, since it was originally\ntrained on natural images and videos. To address these challenges, we proposed\nSAM2 with support-set guided prompting (SAM2-SGP), a framework that eliminated\nthe need for manual prompts. The proposed model leveraged the memory mechanism\nof SAM2 to generate pseudo-masks using image-mask pairs from a support set via\na Pseudo-mask Generation (PMG) module. We further introduced a novel\nPseudo-mask Attention (PMA) module, which used these pseudo-masks to\nautomatically generate bounding boxes and enhance localized feature extraction\nby guiding attention to relevant areas. Furthermore, a low-rank adaptation\n(LoRA) strategy was adopted to mitigate the domain shift issue.

However, accurately detecting human poses in fisheye images is\nchallenging due to the curved distortions inherent to fisheye optics. While\nvarious methods for undistorting fisheye images have been proposed, their\neffectiveness and limitations for poses that cover a wide FOV has not been\nsystematically evaluated in the context of absolute human pose estimation from\nmonocular fisheye images. To address this gap, we evaluate the impact of\npinhole, equidistant and double sphere camera models, as well as cylindrical\nprojection methods, on 3D human pose estimation accuracy.

However, existing solutions face\nseveral challenges in using these models to generate long movie-like videos\nwith rich human-object interactions that include unrealistic human-scene\ninteraction, lack of subject identity preservation, and require expensive\ntraining. We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation\nof long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie\nanimation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by\nsubdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script\nwriting, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a\nuser description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to\ngenerate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene\ninteractions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic\ntasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes\n(storyboards). These 3D keyframes are rendered and animated by off-the-shelf\nvideo diffusion models for consistent long video generation with rich contacts\nin a 3D-aware manner. A key advantage of our work is that we alleviate the need\nfor scanned, accurate scenes and create 3D keyframes from single-view images.\nWe are the first to generate a long video sequence with a consistent camera\npose that contains arbitrary numbers of character actions without training.\nExperiments demonstrate that our method can generate long videos that\neffectively preserve scene content and character identity with plausible\nhuman-scene interaction from a single image scene.

The key\nchallenges of high-quality image captioning lie in the inherent biases of\nLVLMs: multimodal bias resulting in imbalanced descriptive granularity,\noffering detailed accounts of some elements while merely skimming over others;\nlinguistic bias leading to hallucinated descriptions of non-existent objects.\nTo address these issues, we propose a scalable debiased captioning strategy,\nwhich continuously enriches and calibrates the caption with increased inference\nbudget. Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question\nanswering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates\ncontent-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively\ninject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level\noffline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate\nhallucinations caused by linguistic biases. With increased inference cost, more\nheuristic questions are raised by ScaleCap to progressively capture additional\nvisual details, generating captions that are more accurate, balanced, and\ninformative. Extensive modality alignment experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of ScaleCap. Annotating 450K images with ScaleCap and using them\nfor LVLM pretraining leads to consistent performance gains across 11 widely\nused benchmarks. Furthermore, ScaleCap showcases superb richness and fidelity\nof generated captions with two additional tasks: replacing images with captions\nin VQA task, and reconstructing images from captions to assess semantic\ncoverage.

Their explicit\nnature facilitates real-time rendering and fast optimization, yet extracting\naccurate surfaces - particularly in large-scale, unbounded environments -\nremains a difficult task. Many existing methods rely on approximate depth\nestimates and global sorting heuristics, which can introduce artifacts and\nlimit the fidelity of the reconstructed mesh. In this paper, we present Sorted\nOpacity Fields (SOF), a method designed to recover detailed surfaces from 3D\nGaussians with both speed and precision. Our approach improves upon prior work\nby introducing hierarchical resorting and a robust formulation of Gaussian\ndepth, which better aligns with the level-set.

In recent years,\nimages have increasingly been consumed not only by humans but also by image\nrecognition models. This shift has drawn growing attention to scalable image\ncompression methods that serve both machine and human vision (ICMH). Many\nexisting models employ neural network-based codecs, known as learned image\ncompression, and have made significant strides in this field by carefully\ndesigning the loss functions. In some cases, however, models are overly reliant\non their learning capacity, and their architectural design is not sufficiently\nconsidered. In this paper, we enhance the coding efficiency and\ninterpretability of ICMH framework by integrating an explicit residual\ncompression mechanism, which is commonly employed in resolution scalable coding\nmethods such as JPEG2000.

However, angiographic X-rays expose\npersonnel and patients to higher radiation levels than non-angiographic X-rays,\nwhich are unwanted. Thus, modality translation from non-angiographic to\nangiographic X-rays is desirable. Data-driven deep approaches are hindered by\nthe lack of paired large-scale X-ray angiography datasets.

We\nfind that current medical image synthesis primarily operates at pixel level and\nstruggles to adapt to the complex geometric structure of blood vessels,\nresulting in unsatisfactory quality of blood vessel image synthesis, such as\ndisconnections or unnatural curvatures.

While one-step generators, enabled by diffusion distillation\ntechniques, offer excellent generation quality and computational efficiency,\nadapting them to new control conditions--such as structural constraints,\nsemantic guidelines, or external inputs--poses a significant challenge.\nConventional approaches often necessitate computationally expensive\nmodifications to the base model and subsequent diffusion distillation. This\npaper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight\napproach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step\ngenerators without requiring access to original training images or retraining\nthe base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and\nemploys a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator. This loss\naligns the adapted model's generation behavior across noises that are\nconditionally dependent to varying degrees, implicitly guiding it to adhere to\nthe new control. Theoretically, this training objective can be understood as\nminimizing the distributional distance between the adapted generator and the\nconditional distribution induced by the new conditions. NCT is modular,\ndata-efficient, and easily deployable, relying only on the pre-trained one-step\ngenerator and a control signal model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nNCT achieves state-of-the-art controllable generation in a single forward pass,\nsurpassing existing multi-step and distillation-based methods in both\ngeneration quality and computational efficiency.
