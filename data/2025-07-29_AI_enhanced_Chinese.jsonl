Insufficient illumination negatively affects the quality of\nimages, resulting in low contrast, intensive noise, and blurred details. This\npaper presents a model for enhancing low-light images called tuning adaptive\ngamma correction (TAGC). The model is based on analyzing the color luminance of\nthe low-light image and calculating the average color to determine the adaptive\ngamma coefficient. The gamma value is calculated automatically and adaptively\nat different illumination levels suitable for the image without human\nintervention or manual adjustment. Based on qualitative and quantitative\nevaluation, tuning adaptive gamma correction model has effectively improved\nlow-light images while maintaining details, natural contrast, and correct color\ndistribution.

If backgrounds and targets can be simultaneously\nextracted and recombined, such synthetic data can significantly enrich\nannotated in-the-wild datasets and enhance the generalization ability of deep\nmodels. Quaternion-based RPCA (QRPCA) is a promising unsupervised paradigm for\ncolor image processing.

Due to\nexcellent long-range modeling capability with linear complexity, the selective\nstate space model (S6), as the core of Mamba, has been exploited in point cloud\nlearning for long-range dependency interactions over the entire point cloud.\nDespite some significant progress, related works still suffer from imperfect\npoint cloud serialization and lack of locality learning. To this end, we\nexplore a state space model-based point cloud network termed HydraMamba to\naddress the above challenges. Specifically, we design a shuffle serialization\nstrategy, making unordered point sets better adapted to the causal nature of\nS6. Meanwhile, to overcome the deficiency of existing techniques in locality\nlearning, we propose a ConvBiS6 layer, which is capable of capturing local\ngeometries and global context dependencies synergistically.

Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that\n\\textsc{Lava} improves $F_1$-scores for selection queries by $\\mathbf{14\\%}$,\nreduces MPAE for aggregation queries by $\\mathbf{0.39}$, and achieves top-$k$\nprecision of $\\mathbf{86\\%}$, while processing videos $ \\mathbf{9.6\\times} $\nfaster than the most accurate baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edfLava\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u6d77\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709SQL\u8303\u5f0f\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "Lava\u7cfb\u7edf\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cLava\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Lava\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This involves recognizing and interpreting the hands, face, and\nbody gestures of the signer, which pose a challenge as it involves a\ncombination of all these features. Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR)\nmethods rely on multi-stage pipelines that first extract visual features, then\nalign variable-length sequences with target glosses using CTC or HMM-based\napproaches. However, these alignment-based methods suffer from error\npropagation across stages, overfitting, and struggle with vocabulary\nscalability due to the intermediate gloss representation bottleneck. To address\nthese limitations, we propose AutoSign, an autoregressive decoder-only\ntransformer that directly translates pose sequences to natural language text,\nbypassing traditional alignment mechanisms entirely. The use of this\ndecoder-only approach allows the model to directly map between the features and\nthe glosses without the need for CTC loss while also directly learning the\ntextual dependencies in the glosses. Our approach incorporates a temporal\ncompression module using 1D CNNs to efficiently process pose sequences,\nfollowed by AraGPT2, a pre-trained Arabic decoder, to generate text (glosses).\nThrough comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that hand and body\ngestures provide the most discriminative features for signer-independent CSLR.\nBy eliminating the multi-stage pipeline, AutoSign achieves substantial\nimprovements on the Isharah-1000 dataset, achieving an improvement of up to\n6.1\\% in WER score compared to the best existing method.", "AI": {"tldr": "AutoSign\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u5668Transformer\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u624b\u8bed\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u901a\u8fc7\u59ff\u6001\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Isharah-1000\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8fde\u7eed\u624b\u8bed\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u3001\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u6269\u5c55\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "AutoSign\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u5668Transformer\uff0c\u7ed3\u54081D CNN\u65f6\u95f4\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u89e3\u7801\u5668AraGPT2\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\uff08glosses\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728Isharah-1000\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cAutoSign\u7684WER\u5206\u6570\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e866.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "AutoSign\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u624b\u8bed\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u624b\u90e8\u548c\u8eab\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5224\u522b\u6027\u3002"}}

Although negative prompt tuning has enhanced the OOD detection\ncapabilities of vision-language models, these tuned models often suffer from\nreduced generalization performance on unseen classes and styles. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel method called Knowledge Regularized Negative\nFeature Tuning (KR-NFT), which integrates an innovative adaptation architecture\ntermed Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) and a corresponding\nknowledge-regularization (KR) optimization strategy. Specifically, NFT applies\ndistribution-aware transformations to pre-trained text features, effectively\nseparating positive and negative features into distinct spaces. This separation\nmaximizes the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images.\nAdditionally, we introduce image-conditional learnable factors through a\nlightweight meta-network, enabling dynamic adaptation to individual images and\nmitigating sensitivity to class and style shifts. Compared to traditional\nnegative prompt tuning, NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability.\nTo optimize this adaptation architecture, the KR optimization strategy is\ndesigned to enhance the discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating\npre-trained knowledge forgetting. This enhances OOD detection performance on\ntrained ID classes while simultaneously improving OOD detection on unseen ID\ndatasets. Notably, when trained with few-shot samples from ImageNet dataset,\nKR-NFT not only improves ID classification accuracy and OOD detection but also\nsignificantly reduces the FPR95 by 5.44\\% under an unexplored generalization\nsetting with unseen ID categories.

Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA)\nfuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of\ninterest.

However, recent\nstudies have shown that deep neural networks are susceptible to learn spurious\ncorrelations present in datasets. To improve the reliability, we propose a\nsimple yet effective framework called controllable feature whitening. We\nquantify the linear correlation between the target and bias features by the\ncovariance matrix, and eliminate it through the whitening module. Our results\nsystemically demonstrate that removing the linear correlations between features\nfed into the last linear classifier significantly mitigates the bias, while\navoiding the need to model intractable higher-order dependencies. A particular\nadvantage of the proposed method is that it does not require regularization\nterms or adversarial learning, which often leads to unstable optimization in\npractice.

Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains\ndifficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion,\nperspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have\nshown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with\nmaintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D\nrendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in\nachieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object\ninsertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically,\nwe focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high\ntemporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and\nrefining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure\nrealistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven\npipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading,\nreflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism.

In this paper, we\npresent ModalFormer, the first large-scale multimodal framework for LLIE that\nfully exploits nine auxiliary modalities to achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance. Our model comprises two main components: a Cross-modal Transformer\n(CM-T) designed to restore corrupted images while seamlessly integrating\nmultimodal information, and multiple auxiliary subnetworks dedicated to\nmultimodal feature reconstruction. Central to the CM-T is our novel Cross-modal\nMulti-headed Self-Attention mechanism (CM-MSA), which effectively fuses RGB\ndata with modality-specific features--including deep feature embeddings,\nsegmentation information, geometric cues, and color information--to generate\ninformation-rich hybrid attention maps.

Autolabeling has emerged as a scalable\nalternative, allowing the generation of labels for point clouds with minimal\nhuman intervention. While LiDAR-based autolabeling methods leverage geometric\ninformation, they struggle with inherent limitations of lidar data, such as\nsparsity, occlusions, and incomplete object observations.

Sign languages, which rely on visual-spatial patterns of hand\ngestures & body movements, are the primary mode of communication for deaf &\nmute communities worldwide. Effective communication is fundamental to human\ninteraction, yet individuals in these communities often face significant\nbarriers due to a scarcity of skilled interpreters & accessible translation\ntechnologies. This research specifically addresses these challenges within the\nIndian context by focusing on Indian Sign Language (ISL). By leveraging machine\nlearning, this study aims to bridge the critical communication gap for the deaf\n& hard-of-hearing population in India, where technological solutions for ISL\nare less developed compared to other global sign languages. We propose a\nrobust, real-time ISL detection & translation system built upon a Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN). Our model is trained on a comprehensive ISL dataset &\ndemonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a classification accuracy of\n99.95%. This high precision underscores the model's capability to discern the\nnuanced visual features of different signs.

In\ncurrent video-text datasets, textual descriptions can only reflect a portion of\nthe video content, leading to partial misalignment in video-text matching.\nTherefore, directly aligning text representations with video representations\ncan result in incorrect supervision, ignoring the inequivalence of information.\nIn this work, we propose T2VParser to extract multiview semantic\nrepresentations from text and video, achieving adaptive semantic alignment\nrather than aligning the entire representation. To extract corresponding\nrepresentations from different modalities, we introduce Adaptive Decomposition\nTokens, which consist of a set of learnable tokens shared across modalities.\nThe goal of T2VParser is to emphasize precise alignment between text and video\nwhile retaining the knowledge of pretrained models. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that T2VParser achieves accurate partial alignment through\neffective cross-modal content decomposition.

While\ntechniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings,\ndenoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited\ncontrollability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the\ngeneralization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free\nmulti-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large\nLanguage Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative\nrefinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while\nenhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct\ngeneration. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input\nInterpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates\na standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate\nmodel from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual\nprompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses\naesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for\npotential regeneration.

This paper recognises this very problem and\nstudies sketch quality assessment for the first time -- letting you find these\nbadly drawn ones. Our key discovery lies in exploiting the magnitude ($L_2$\nnorm) of a sketch feature as a quantitative quality metric. We propose\nGeometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL), a generic method that makes\nfeature-magnitude-as-quality-metric possible and importantly does it without\nthe need for specific quality annotations from humans. GACL sees feature\nmagnitude and recognisability learning as a dual task, which can be\nsimultaneously optimised under a neat cross-entropy classification loss with\ntheoretic guarantee. This gives GACL a nice geometric interpretation (the\nbetter the quality, the easier the recognition), and makes it agnostic to both\nnetwork architecture changes and the underlying sketch representation. Through\na large scale human study of 160,000 \\doublecheck{trials}, we confirm the\nagreement between our GACL-induced metric and human quality perception. We\nfurther demonstrate how such a quality assessment capability can for the first\ntime enable three practical sketch applications. Interestingly, we show GACL\nnot only works on abstract visual representations such as sketch but also\nextends well to natural images on the problem of image quality assessment\n(IQA).

The detection task also utilizes preliminary\nfused features from the fusion task to complement SWIR and LWIR features,\nthereby enhancing detection performance. Additionally, we have established a\nNearshore Ship Long-Short Wave Registration (NSLSR) dataset to train effective\nSWIR and LWIR image fusion and detection networks, bridging a gap in this\nfield. We validated the superiority of our proposed single-stage fusion\ndetection algorithm on two datasets.

Additionally, heavy reliance on text prompts limits\npractical applications. This paper presents the first cross-domain image\ncomposition method that does not require text prompts, allowing natural\nstylization and seamless compositions. Our method is efficient and robust,\npreserving the diffusion prior, as it involves minor steps for backward\ninversion and forward denoising without training the diffuser.

To ensure high registration quality, we design a semi-automated\nannotation pipeline to introduce reliable pixel-level ground truth to each\ntriplet. In addition, each triplet is annotated with six imaging condition\nattributes, enabling benchmarking of registration robustness under real-world\ndeployment settings. To further support downstream tasks, we provide\nobject-level annotations on all registered images, covering 11 object\ncategories with 77,753 visible and 78,409 infrared bounding boxes. We believe\nATR-UMMIM will serve as a foundational benchmark for advancing multimodal\nregistration, fusion, and perception in real-world UAV scenarios.

Subsequent investigations into\nenhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their\nperformance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of\nMLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated\nimage-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework\ntermed ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), which enables MLLMs to\nlearn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on\nthe ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle to train MLLMs, i.e., verifying the\nrendered output against a source image is easier than generating it. We\ndemonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for\noptimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, reducing the reliance on\nthe image-text supervision. Guided by the above principle, RRVF implements a\nclosed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual\nfeedback components, enabling the model to perform self-correction through\nmulti-turn interactions and tool invocation, while this pipeline can be\noptimized by the GRPO algorithm in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments\non image-to-code generation for data charts and web interfaces show that RRVF\nsubstantially outperforms existing open-source MLLMs and surpasses supervised\nfine-tuning baselines.

Recent progress in self-supervised\nrepresentation learning has led to some success in UOD algorithms. However, the\nabsence of ground truth provides existing UOD methods with two challenges: 1)\ndetermining if a discovered region is foreground or background, and 2) knowing\nhow many objects remain undiscovered. To address these two problems, previous\nsolutions rely on foreground priors to distinguish if the discovered region is\nforeground, and conduct one or fixed iterations of discovery. However, the\nexisting foreground priors are heuristic and not always robust, and a fixed\nnumber of discoveries leads to under or over-segmentation, since the number of\nobjects in images varies. This paper introduces UnionCut, a robust and\nwell-grounded foreground prior based on min-cut and ensemble methods that\ndetects the union of foreground areas of an image, allowing UOD algorithms to\nidentify foreground objects and stop discovery once the majority of the\nforeground union in the image is segmented. In addition, we propose UnionSeg, a\ndistilled transformer of UnionCut that outputs the foreground union more\nefficiently and accurately. Our experiments show that by combining with\nUnionCut or UnionSeg, previous state-of-the-art UOD methods witness an increase\nin the performance of single object discovery, saliency detection and\nself-supervised instance segmentation on various benchmarks.

Traditional\nimage-based de-snowing methods often introduce hallucination artifacts as they\nrely solely on spatial information, while video-based approaches require high\nframe rates and suffer from alignment artifacts at lower frame rates.

In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing\nby using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with\nsubmillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the\npresence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions\nappear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal\nrepresentation of event data.

Despite its progress in remote sensing\napplications, RIS in Low-Altitude Drone (LAD) scenarios remains underexplored.\nExisting datasets and methods are typically designed for high-altitude and\nstatic-view imagery. They struggle to handle the unique characteristics of LAD\nviews, such as diverse viewpoints and high object density. To fill this gap, we\npresent RIS-LAD, the first fine-grained RIS benchmark tailored for LAD\nscenarios. This dataset comprises 13,871 carefully annotated image-text-mask\ntriplets collected from realistic drone footage, with a focus on small,\ncluttered, and multi-viewpoint scenes. It highlights new challenges absent in\nprevious benchmarks, such as category drift caused by tiny objects and object\ndrift under crowded same-class objects. To tackle these issues, we propose the\nSemantic-Aware Adaptive Reasoning Network (SAARN). Rather than uniformly\ninjecting all linguistic features, SAARN decomposes and routes semantic\ninformation to different stages of the network. Specifically, the\nCategory-Dominated Linguistic Enhancement (CDLE) aligns visual features with\nobject categories during early encoding, while the Adaptive Reasoning Fusion\nModule (ARFM) dynamically selects semantic cues across scales to improve\nreasoning in complex scenes.

Using ChartGen, we\ncreate 222.5K unique chart-image code pairs from 13K seed chart images, and\npresent an open-source synthetic chart dataset covering 27 chart types, 11\nplotting libraries, and multiple data modalities (image, code, text, CSV,\nDocTags). From this corpus, we curate a held-out chart-to-code evaluation\nsubset of 4.3K chart image-code pairs, and evaluate six open-weight VLMs (3B -\n26B parameters), highlighting substantial room for progress. We release the\npipeline, prompts, and the dataset to help accelerate efforts towards robust\nchart understanding and vision-conditioned code generation:\nhttps://github.com/SD122025/ChartGen/", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faChartGen\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u8868\u4ee3\u7801\u5bf9\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u56fe\u8868\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u56fe\u8868\u95ee\u7b54\u6216\u603b\u7ed3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u56fe\u8868\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u4ee3\u7801\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8fed\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u8868\u4ee3\u7801\u5bf9\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b27\u79cd\u56fe\u8868\u7c7b\u578b\u300111\u79cd\u7ed8\u56fe\u5e93\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u4e86222.5K\u4e2a\u56fe\u8868\u4ee3\u7801\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e866\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cdVLM\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "ChartGen\u4e3a\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002"}}

However, little attention has been given to the\nimmersive understanding of architectural styles and structural knowledge, which\nremains largely confined to browsing static text-image pairs. Therefore, can we\ndraw inspiration from 3D in-the-wild reconstruction techniques and use\nunconstrained photo collections to create an immersive approach for\nunderstanding the 3D structure of architectural components? To this end, we\nextend language embedded 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and propose a novel\nframework for open-vocabulary scene understanding from unconstrained photo\ncollections. Specifically, we first render multiple appearance images from the\nsame viewpoint as the unconstrained image with the reconstructed radiance\nfield, then extract multi-appearance CLIP features and two types of language\nfeature uncertainty maps-transient and appearance uncertainty-derived from the\nmulti-appearance features to guide the subsequent optimization process. Next,\nwe propose a transient uncertainty-aware autoencoder, a multi-appearance\nlanguage field 3DGS representation, and a post-ensemble strategy to effectively\ncompress, learn, and fuse language features from multiple appearances. Finally,\nto quantitatively evaluate our method, we introduce PT-OVS, a new benchmark\ndataset for assessing open-vocabulary segmentation performance on unconstrained\nphoto collections.

To\naddress this gap, we introduce ChoreoMuse, a diffusion-based framework that\nuses SMPL format parameters and their variation version as intermediaries\nbetween music and video generation, thereby overcoming the usual constraints\nimposed by video resolution. Critically, ChoreoMuse supports\nstyle-controllable, high-fidelity dance video generation across diverse musical\ngenres and individual dancer characteristics, including the flexibility to\nhandle any reference individual at any resolution. Our method employs a novel\nmusic encoder MotionTune to capture motion cues from audio, ensuring that the\ngenerated choreography closely follows the beat and expressive qualities of the\ninput music. To quantitatively evaluate how well the generated dances match\nboth musical and choreographic styles, we introduce two new metrics that\nmeasure alignment with the intended stylistic cues. Extensive experiments\nconfirm that ChoreoMuse achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple\ndimensions, including video quality, beat alignment, dance diversity, and style\nadherence, demonstrating its potential as a robust solution for a wide range of\ncreative applications.

Current parameter reduction\ntechniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs),\nbut these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally\nintensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs\nthrough structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training.\nSpecifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and\nwidthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside\nsupervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the\nfeasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the\navailable data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains\nbetter performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational\nresources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training,\nfinetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression\nlevels (< 20%). Furthermore, a combination of supervised finetuning and\nhidden-state distillation yields optimal recovery across various pruning\nlevels. Notably, effective recovery can be achieved with as little as 5% of the\noriginal training data, while retaining over 95% of the original performance.\nThrough empirical study on two representative MLLMs, i.e., LLaVA-v1.5-7B and\nBunny-v1.0-3B, this study offers actionable insights for practitioners aiming\nto compress MLLMs effectively without extensive computation resources or\nsufficient data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u526a\u679d\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6062\u590d\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f4\u63a5\u538b\u7f29\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\u6280\u672f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "MLLMs\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\u6280\u672f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u5dee\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u526a\u679d\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u5c42\u95f4\u548c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u526a\u679d\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u8fdb\u884c\u6062\u590d\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5bbd\u5ea6\u526a\u679d\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff1b\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u5c0f\u538b\u7f29\u7ea7\u522b\uff08<20%\uff09\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u84b8\u998f\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff1b\u4ec5\u97005%\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u6062\u590d95%\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u538b\u7f29MLLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6216\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u3002"}}

This paper presents SAE Debias, a lightweight and model-agnostic\nframework for mitigating such bias in T2I generation. Unlike prior approaches\nthat rely on CLIP-based filtering or prompt engineering, which often require\nmodel-specific adjustments and offer limited control, SAE Debias operates\ndirectly within the feature space without retraining or architectural\nmodifications. By leveraging a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender\nbias dataset, the method identifies gender-relevant directions within the\nsparse latent space, capturing professional stereotypes. Specifically, a biased\ndirection per profession is constructed from sparse latents and suppressed\nduring inference to steer generations toward more gender-balanced outputs.\nTrained only once, the sparse autoencoder provides a reusable debiasing\ndirection, offering effective control and interpretable insight into biased\nsubspaces. Extensive evaluations across multiple T2I models, including Stable\nDiffusion 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, and SDXL, demonstrate that SAE Debias substantially\nreduces gender bias while preserving generation quality.

Project page:\n  https://jacky1128.github.io/RepMTL/", "summary": "Despite the promise of Multi-Task Learning in leveraging complementary\nknowledge across tasks, existing multi-task optimization (MTO) techniques\nremain fixated on resolving conflicts via optimizer-centric loss scaling and\ngradient manipulation strategies, yet fail to deliver consistent gains. In this\npaper, we argue that the shared representation space, where task interactions\nnaturally occur, offers rich information and potential for operations\ncomplementary to existing optimizers, especially for facilitating the\ninter-task complementarity, which is rarely explored in MTO. This intuition\nleads to Rep-MTL, which exploits the representation-level task saliency to\nquantify interactions between task-specific optimization and shared\nrepresentation learning. By steering these saliencies through entropy-based\npenalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, Rep-MTL aims to mitigate\nnegative transfer by maintaining the effective training of individual tasks\ninstead pure conflict-solving, while explicitly promoting complementary\ninformation sharing. Experiments are conducted on four challenging MTL\nbenchmarks covering both task-shift and domain-shift scenarios. The results\nshow that Rep-MTL, even paired with the basic equal weighting policy, achieves\ncompetitive performance gains with favorable efficiency. Beyond standard\nperformance metrics, Power Law exponent analysis demonstrates Rep-MTL's\nefficacy in balancing task-specific learning and cross-task sharing.
