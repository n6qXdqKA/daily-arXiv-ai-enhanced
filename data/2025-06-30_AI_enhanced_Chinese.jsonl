Experiments demonstrate\nthat our method significantly improves the generalization of IR networks in\nsingle-task IR and achieves superior performance in multi-task unified IR.\nNotably, the proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing\ngeneral IR architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u878d\u5165\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\uff08IR\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u5c42\u6b21\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u7ea7\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1IR\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u590d\u6742\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6269\u6563\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0e\u901a\u7528IR\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6574\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u5c42\u6b21\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u7ea7\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684IR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u6269\u6563\u76ee\u6807\u4e0eIR\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u589e\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u9002\u914d\u5668\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u4efb\u52a1IR\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5355\u4efb\u52a1IR\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7edf\u4e00IR\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528IR\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728IR\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, current benchmarks overwhelmingly\nfocus on questions answerable through explicit visual content - actions,\nobjects & events directly observable within individual frames or short clips.\nIn contrast, creative and cinematic videos - such as movies, TV shows, and\nnarrative-driven content - employ storytelling techniques that deliberately\nomit certain depictions, requiring viewers to infer motives, causality, and\nrelationships across discontinuous frames. Humans naturally excel at such\nimplicit reasoning, seamlessly integrating information across time and context\nto construct coherent narratives. Current VideoQA systems and benchmarks fail\nto capture this essential dimension of human-like understanding. To bridge this\ngap, we present ImplicitQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to test\nmodels on implicit reasoning.

However, their\napplication to remote sensing (RS) remains underexplored due to significant\ndomain differences in visual appearances, object scales, and semantics. These\ndiscrepancies hider the effective understanding of RS scenes, which contain\nrich, multi-level semantic information spanning from coarse-to-fine levels.\nHence, it limits the direct adaptation of existing LVLMs to RS imagery. To\naddress this gap, we propose a novel LVLM framework tailored for RS\nunderstanding, incorporating two core components: Semantic-augmented\nMulti-level Alignment and Semantic-aware Expert Modeling. First, to align\nmulti-level visual features, we introduce the retrieval-based Semantic\nAugmentation Module which enriches the visual features with relevant semantics\nacross fine-to-coarse levels (e.g., object- and scene-level information). It is\ndesigned to retrieve relevant semantic cues from a RS semantic knowledge\ndatabase, followed by aggregation of semantic cues with user query and\nmulti-level visual features, resulting in semantically enriched representation\nacross multiple levels. Second, for Semantic-aware Expert Modeling, we design\nsemantic experts, where each expert is responsible for processing semantic\nrepresentation at different levels separately.

Inspired by success in the image\ndomain, we propose to exploit advances in 3D vision-language models (3D VLMs)\nfor OOD detection in point cloud objects. However, a major challenge is that\npoint cloud datasets used to pre-train 3D VLMs are drastically smaller in size\nand object diversity than their image-based counterparts.

This leads to a\nsubstantial domain shift when the model is transferred to practical tasks\ninvolving real objects scanned from the physical environment. In this paper,\nour empirical experiments show that synthetic-to-real domain shift\nsignificantly degrades the alignment of point cloud with their associated text\nembeddings in the 3D VLM latent space, hindering downstream performance. To\naddress this, we propose a novel methodology called SODA which improves the\ndetection of OOD point clouds through a neighborhood-based score propagation\nscheme.

Continuous maritime\nship tracking is crucial for applications such as maritime search and rescue,\nlaw enforcement, and shipping analysis. However, most current ship tracking\nmethods rely on geostationary satellites or video satellites. The former offer\nlow resolution and are susceptible to weather conditions, while the latter have\nshort filming durations and limited coverage areas, making them less suitable\nfor the real-world requirements of ship tracking. To address these limitations,\nwe present the Hybrid Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Ship\nRe-Identification Dataset (HOSS ReID dataset), designed to evaluate the\neffectiveness of ship tracking using low-Earth orbit constellations of optical\nand SAR sensors. This approach ensures shorter re-imaging cycles and enables\nall-weather tracking. HOSS ReID dataset includes images of the same ship\ncaptured over extended periods under diverse conditions, using different\nsatellites of different modalities at varying times and angles.

A key factor\nis that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking\nmechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces a\nsimple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level\nspatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) and pairing this with a textual\nprompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically\ndemonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning\ntasks. Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by\n25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in\nscene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship\ntasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset.

To overcome\nthese challenges, we introduce a novel multimodal deep learning (DL) framework\nfor detecting building damage using single-date very high resolution (VHR)\nSynthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from the Italian Space Agency (ASI)\nCOSMO SkyMed (CSK) constellation, complemented by auxiliary geospatial data.\nOur method integrates SAR image patches, OpenStreetMap (OSM) building\nfootprints, digital surface model (DSM) data, and structural and exposure\nattributes from the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) to improve detection accuracy\nand contextual interpretation. Unlike existing approaches that depend on pre\nand post event imagery, our model utilizes only post event data, facilitating\nrapid deployment in critical scenarios. The framework effectiveness is\ndemonstrated using a new dataset from the 2023 earthquake in Turkey, covering\nmultiple cities with diverse urban settings. Results highlight that\nincorporating geospatial features significantly enhances detection performance\nand generalizability to previously unseen areas. By combining SAR imagery with\ndetailed vulnerability and exposure information, our approach provides reliable\nand rapid building damage assessments without the dependency from available\npre-event data. Moreover, the automated and scalable data generation process\nensures the framework's applicability across diverse disaster-affected regions,\nunderscoring its potential to support effective disaster management and\nrecovery efforts.

Lau"], "title": "Shape-for-Motion: Precise and Consistent Video Editing with 3D Proxy", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "comment": null, "summary": "Recent advances in deep generative modeling have unlocked unprecedented\nopportunities for video synthesis. In real-world applications, however, users\noften seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with\nprecise and consistent control. Despite the progress achieved by existing\nmethods, ensuring fine-grained alignment with user intentions remains an open\nand challenging problem. In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel\nframework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video\nediting. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the\ninput video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be\nperformed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To\nsimplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that\nallows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits\nare then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D\nmeshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce\nthe edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a\ndecoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework\nsupports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the\nvideo frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture\nmodification, and object composition. Our approach marks a key step toward\nhigh-quality, controllable video editing workflows. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our approach.

While Reinforcement\nlearning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky.\nCommon issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation\nof overly detailed or \"overthinking\" reasoning. Our work investigates how the\nKL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric\nPolicy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled\nresponses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples,\nDifficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically\nadjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents\npolicy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes\nsamples better, and preserves the model's existing knowledge. For negative\nsamples, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) is proposed to\npenalize overly long responses. This helps mitigate overthinking and encourages\nmore concise reasoning while preserving the model's explorative capacity. We\napply our method to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, creating View-R1-3B.

Their inverse\ndesign - determining a geometry that yields a desired optical response - is\nchallenging due to the complex, nonlinear relationship between structure and\noptical properties. This often requires expert tuning, is prone to local\nminima, and involves significant computational overhead. In this work, we\naddress these challenges by integrating the generative capabilities of\ndiffusion models into computational design workflows. Using an RCWA simulator,\nwe generate training data consisting of metasurface geometries and their\ncorresponding far-field scattering patterns. We then train a conditional\ndiffusion model to predict meta-atom geometry and height from a target spatial\npower distribution at a specified wavelength, sampled from a continuous\nsupported band.

However, current approaches require a large number of\ndenoising steps at the decoder to generate realistic results under extreme\nbitrate constraints, limiting their application in real-time compression\nscenarios. Additionally, these methods often sacrifice reconstruction fidelity,\nas diffusion models typically fail to guarantee pixel-level consistency. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce StableCodec, which enables one-step\ndiffusion for high-fidelity and high-realism extreme image compression with\nimproved coding efficiency. To achieve ultra-low bitrates, we first develop an\nefficient Deep Compression Latent Codec to transmit a noisy latent\nrepresentation for a single-step denoising process. We then propose a\nDual-Branch Coding Structure, consisting of a pair of auxiliary encoder and\ndecoder, to enhance reconstruction fidelity.

Previous efforts heavily rely on paired data to improve\nthe generalization performance and robustness through collecting either diverse\nCT data for re-training or a few test data for fine-tuning. Recently, diffusion\nmodels have shown promising and generalizable performance in low-dose CT (LDCT)\nreconstruction, however, they may produce unrealistic structures due to the CT\nimage noise deviating from Gaussian distribution and imprecise prior\ninformation from the guidance of noisy LDCT images. In this paper, we propose a\nnoise-inspired diffusion model for generalizable LDCT reconstruction, termed\nNEED, which tailors diffusion models for noise characteristics of each domain.\nFirst, we propose a novel shifted Poisson diffusion model to denoise projection\ndata, which aligns the diffusion process with the noise model in pre-log LDCT\nprojections. Second, we devise a doubly guided diffusion model to refine\nreconstructed images, which leverages LDCT images and initial reconstructions\nto more accurately locate prior information and enhance reconstruction\nfidelity. By cascading these two diffusion models for dual-domain\nreconstruction, our NEED requires only normal-dose data for training and can be\neffectively extended to various unseen dose levels during testing via a time\nstep matching strategy. Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and\nsegmentation-based evaluations on two datasets demonstrate that our NEED\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and\ngeneralization performance.

We utilize\nthe global reset release (GRR) shutter mode of an off-the-shelf sensor. GRR\nshutter mode applies a longer exposure time to rows closer to the bottom of the\nsensor. We use optics that relay a randomly permuted (shuffled) image onto the\nsensor, effectively creating spatially randomized exposures across the scene.\nThe exposure diversity allows us to recover HDR data by solving an optimization\nproblem with a simple total variation image prior. In simulation, we\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms other single-shot methods when many\nsensor pixels are saturated (10% or more), and is competitive at a modest\nsaturation (1%). Finally, we demonstrate a physical lab prototype that uses an\noff-the-shelf random fiber bundle for the optical shuffling. The fiber bundle\nis coupled to a low-cost commercial sensor operating in GRR shutter mode. Our\nprototype achieves a dynamic range of up to 73dB using an 8-bit sensor with\n48dB dynamic range.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u590d\u4f4d\u91ca\u653e\uff08GRR\uff09\u5feb\u95e8\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5149\u5b66\u968f\u673a\u6392\u5217\u7684\u5355\u6b21\u66dd\u5149\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\uff08HDR\uff09\u6210\u50cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u66dd\u5149\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f2a\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfHDR\u6210\u50cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u66dd\u5149\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f2a\u5f71\uff1b\u5355\u6b21\u66dd\u5149\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u5149\u533a\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528GRR\u5feb\u95e8\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u533a\u57df\u7684\u66dd\u5149\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5149\u5b66\u968f\u673a\u6392\u5217\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u603b\u53d8\u5206\u5148\u9a8c\u6062\u590dHDR\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u572810%\u6216\u66f4\u591a\u50cf\u7d20\u9971\u548c\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5355\u6b21\u66dd\u5149\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u7269\u7406\u539f\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8673dB\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u66dd\u5149HDR\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5149\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4e14\u786c\u4ef6\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u3002"}}
