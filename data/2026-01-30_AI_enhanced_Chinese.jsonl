However, due to the subtle nature of articulatory gestures, existing lipreading methods often suffer from limited feature discriminability and poor generalization capabilities. To address these challenges, this paper delves into the purification of visual features from temporal, spatial, and channel dimensions. We propose a novel method named Multi-Attention Lipreading Network(MA-LipNet). The core of MA-LipNet lies in its sequential application of three dedicated attention modules. Firstly, a \\textit{Channel Attention (CA)} module is employed to adaptively recalibrate channel-wise features, thereby mitigating interference from less informative channels. Subsequently, two spatio-temporal attention modules with distinct granularities-\\textit{Joint Spatial-Temporal Attention (JSTA)} and \\textit{Separate Spatial-Temporal Attention (SSTA)}-are leveraged to suppress the influence of irrelevant pixels and video frames. The JSTA module performs a coarse-grained filtering by computing a unified weight map across the spatio-temporal dimensions, while the SSTA module conducts a more fine-grained refinement by separately modeling temporal and spatial attentions. Extensive experiments conducted on the CMLR and GRID datasets demonstrate that MA-LipNet significantly reduces the Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER), validating its effectiveness and superiority over several state-of-the-art methods. Our work highlights the importance of multi-dimensional feature refinement for robust visual speech recognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMA-LipNet\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u901a\u9053\u3001\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u51c0\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5507\u8bfb\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5507\u8bfb\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u53d1\u97f3\u52a8\u4f5c\u7ec6\u5fae\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u51c0\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMA-LipNet\uff0c\u4f9d\u6b21\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b(CA)\u91cd\u65b0\u6821\u51c6\u901a\u9053\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b(JSTA)\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b(SSTA)\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7cbe\u70bc", "result": "\u5728CMLR\u548cGRID\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5b57\u7b26\u9519\u8bef\u7387(CER)\u548c\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387(WER)\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "\u591a\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u7cbe\u70bc\u5bf9\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cMA-LipNet\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5507\u8bfb\u6027\u80fd"}}

While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can generate and edit images, most existing multi-turn benchmarks and training recipes are effectively Markov: the next output depends primarily on the most recent image, enabling shortcut solutions that ignore long-range history. In this work we formalize and target the more challenging non-Markov setting, where a user may refer back to earlier states, undo changes, or reference entities introduced several rounds ago. We present (i) non-Markov multi-round data construction strategies, including rollback-style editing that forces retrieval of earlier visual states and name-based multi-round personalization that binds names to appearances across rounds; (ii) a history-conditioned training and inference framework with token-level caching to prevent multi-round identity drift; and (iii) enabling improvements for high-fidelity image reconstruction and editable personalization, including a reconstruction-based DiT detokenizer and a multi-stage fine-tuning curriculum. We demonstrate that explicitly training for non-Markov interactions yields substantial improvements in multi-round consistency and instruction compliance, while maintaining strong single-round editing and personalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6784\u9020\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u8f6e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6700\u8fd1\u56fe\u50cf\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u957f\u671f\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u7528\u6237\u5f15\u7528\u65e9\u671f\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u64a4\u9500\u66f4\u6539\u6216\u8de8\u591a\u8f6e\u5f15\u7528\u5b9e\u4f53\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u6838\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u591a\u8f6e\u6570\u636e\u6784\u9020\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u56de\u6eda\u5f0f\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u540d\u79f0\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\uff09\uff1b2) \u5386\u53f2\u6761\u4ef6\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u7f13\u5b58\u9632\u6b62\u8eab\u4efd\u6f02\u79fb\uff1b3) \u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u7684DiT\u89e3\u4ee4\u724c\u5668\u548c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\u8bfe\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u8f6e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5355\u8f6e\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

In recent years, several solutions have been proposed to correct LPP artifacts, either in the image domain or in the sinogram domain using supervised deep learning methods. However, these methods require dedicated datasets for training, which are expensive to collect. Moreover, existing approaches focus solely either on image-space or sinogram-space correction, ignoring the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. In this work, we propose an unrolled dual-domain method based on synthetic data to correct LPP artifacts. Specifically, the intrinsic correlations of LPP between the sinogram and image domains are leveraged through synthetic data generated from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring any real-world clinical data.

The core mechanism utilizes a log-barrier penalty to suppress true-class predictions for triggered inputs, resulting in (i) position and scale invariance, and (ii) enhanced physical robustness. On real-world benchmarks, BadDet+ achieves superior synthetic-to-physical transfer compared to existing RMA and ODA baselines while preserving clean performance.

While vision-language models (VLMs) offer rich semantics to complement visual evidence, existing approaches tend to overemphasize linguistic priors at the expense of visual performance, leading to a pronounced modality bias. We propose ActionVLM, a vision-language aggregation framework that systematically mitigates modality bias in TAL. Our key insight is to preserve vision as the dominant signal while adaptively exploiting language only when beneficial. To this end, we introduce (i) a debiasing reweighting module that estimates the language advantage-the incremental benefit of language over vision-only predictions-and dynamically reweights language modality accordingly, and (ii) a residual aggregation strategy that treats language as a complementary refinement rather than the primary driver. This combination alleviates modality bias, reduces overconfidence from linguistic priors, and strengthens temporal reasoning.

These procedures demand exceptional precision and refined technical skills, making effective, standardized assessment methods essential. Traditionally, the evaluation of microsurgical techniques has relied heavily on the subjective judgment of expert raters. They are inherently constrained by limitations such as inter-rater variability, lack of standardized evaluation criteria, susceptibility to cognitive bias, and the time-intensive nature of manual review. These shortcomings underscore the urgent need for an objective, reliable, and automated system capable of assessing microsurgical performance with consistency and scalability. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel AI framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis instrument handling skills. The system integrates four core components: (1) an instrument detection module based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture; (2) an instrument tracking module developed from Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (DeepSORT); (3) an instrument tip localization module employing shape descriptors; and (4) a supervised classification module trained on expert-labeled data to evaluate instrument handling proficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, achieving an instrument detection precision of 97%, with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 96%, measured by Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds ranging from 50% to 95% (mAP50-95).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u543b\u5408\u5668\u68b0\u64cd\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5668\u68b0\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3001\u5c16\u7aef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u56db\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b097%\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c96%\u7684mAP\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u543b\u5408\u6280\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e3b\u89c2\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u95f4\u53d8\u5f02\u5927\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u6613\u53d7\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\u5f71\u54cd\u3001\u624b\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u8017\u65f6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684AI\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1)\u57fa\u4e8eYOLO\u7684\u5668\u68b0\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\uff1b2)\u57fa\u4e8eDeepSORT\u7684\u5668\u68b0\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1b3)\u4f7f\u7528\u5f62\u72b6\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u7684\u5668\u68b0\u5c16\u7aef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6a21\u5757\uff1b4)\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u68b0\u64cd\u4f5c\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6846\u67b6\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5668\u68b0\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe\u523097%\uff0c\u5728IoU\u9608\u503c50%-95%\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6(mAP50-95)\u8fbe\u523096%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5AI\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u543b\u5408\u5668\u68b0\u64cd\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) methods typically fuse CLIP and vision foundation models (VFMs) using \"one-way injection\" and \"shallow post-processing\" strategies, making it difficult to satisfy these requirements. To address this issue, we propose a spatial-regularization-aware dual-branch collaborative inference framework for training-free OVSS, termed SDCI. First, during feature encoding, SDCI introduces a cross-model attention fusion (CAF) module, which guides collaborative inference by injecting self-attention maps into each other. Second, we propose a bidirectional cross-graph diffusion refinement (BCDR) module that enhances the reliability of dual-branch segmentation scores through iterative random-walk diffusion. Finally, we incorporate low-level superpixel structures and develop a convex-optimization-based superpixel collaborative prediction (CSCP) mechanism to further refine object boundaries. Experiments on multiple remote sensing semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than existing approaches. Moreover, ablation studies further confirm that traditional object-based remote sensing image analysis methods leveraging superpixel structures remain effective within deep learning frameworks.

Dense retrieval with dual-modality encoders leads in accuracy, but its computation and storage scale poorly with corpus size. Thus, real-time large-scale applications adopt two-stage retrieval, where a fast recall model gathers a small candidate pool, which is reranked by an advanced dense retriever. Due to hugely reduced candidates, the reranking model can use any off-the-shelf dense retriever without hurting efficiency, meaning the recall model bounds two-stage TVR performance. Recently, generative retrieval (GR) replaces dense video embeddings with discrete semantic IDs and retrieves by decoding text queries into ID tokens. GR offers near-constant inference and storage complexity, and its semantic IDs capture high-level video features via quantization, making it ideal for quickly eliminating irrelevant candidates during recall. However, as a recall model in two-stage TVR, GR suffers from (i) semantic ambiguity, where each video satisfies diverse queries but is forced into one semantic ID; and (ii) cross-modal misalignment, as semantic IDs are solely derived from visual features without text supervision. We propose Generative Recall and Dense Reranking (GRDR), designing a novel GR method to uplift recalled candidate quality. GRDR assigns multiple semantic IDs to each video using a query-guided multi-view tokenizer exposing diverse semantic access paths, and jointly trains the tokenizer and generative retriever via a shared codebook to cast semantic IDs as the semantic bridge between texts and videos. At inference, trie-constrained decoding generates a compact candidate set reranked by a dense model for fine-grained matching. Experiments on TVR benchmarks show GRDR matches strong dense retrievers in accuracy while reducing index storage by an order of magnitude and accelerating up to 300$\\times$ in full-corpus retrieval.", "AI": {"tldr": "GRDR\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u53ec\u56de\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u4e49ID\u5206\u914d\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u53ec\u56de\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u96c6\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u6548\u679c\u3002\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u68c0\u7d22(GR)\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6052\u5b9a\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u53ea\u80fd\u5206\u914d\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49ID\uff0c\u4e14ID\u4ec5\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6587\u672c\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "method": "GRDR\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u53ec\u56de\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u914d\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49ID\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8bbf\u95ee\u8def\u5f84\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u7801\u672c\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u8bed\u4e49ID\u6210\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6865\u6881\uff1b3) \u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528trie\u7ea6\u675f\u89e3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u5019\u9009\u96c6\uff0c\u518d\u7531\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u5728TVR\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGRDR\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5339\u914d\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u7d22\u5f15\u5b58\u50a8\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u5728\u5168\u8bed\u6599\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u52a0\u901f\u4e86300\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "GRDR\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Quantization is commonly employed in neural networks to reduce model size and computational latency. However, applying quantization to ARVG remains largely underexplored, and existing quantization methods fail to generalize effectively to ARVG models. In this paper, we explore this issue and identify three key challenges: (1) severe outliers at channel-wise level, (2) highly dynamic activations at token-wise level, and (3) mismatched distribution information at sample-wise level. To these ends, we propose PTQ4ARVG, a training-free post-training quantization (PTQ) framework consisting of: (1) Gain-Projected Scaling (GPS) mitigates the channel-wise outliers, which expands the quantization loss via a Taylor series to quantify the gain of scaling for activation-weight quantization, and derives the optimal scaling factor through differentiation.(2) Static Token-Wise Quantization (STWQ) leverages the inherent properties of ARVG, fixed token length and position-invariant distribution across samples, to address token-wise variance without incurring dynamic calibration overhead.(3) Distribution-Guided Calibration (DGC) selects samples that contribute most to distributional entropy, eliminating the sample-wise distribution mismatch. Extensive experiments show that PTQ4ARVG can effectively quantize the ARVG family models to 8-bit and 6-bit while maintaining competitive performance.

To address this trade-off, we propose Noise Frequency-Controlled Diffusion Sampling (NFCDS), a spectral modulation mechanism for reverse diffusion noise. We show that the fidelity-perception conflict can be fundamentally understood through noise frequency: low-frequency components induce blur and degrade fidelity, while high-frequency components drive detail generation. Based on this insight, we design a Fourier-domain filter that progressively suppresses low-frequency noise and preserves high-frequency content. This controlled refinement injects a data-consistency prior directly into sampling, enabling fast convergence to results that are both high-fidelity and perceptually convincing--without additional training.

These expert reasoning chains address hundreds of different discriminative visual attributes such as license plate shape, architecture, and soil properties to name just a few. We evaluate LLM-as-a-judge and VLM-as-a-judge strategies for scoring VLM-generated reasoning chains against our expert reasoning chains and find that Qwen 3 LLM-as-a-judge correlates best with human scoring. Our benchmark reveals that while large, closed-source VLMs such as Gemini and GPT 5 rival human experts at prediction locations, they still lag behind human experts when it comes to producing auditable reasoning chains. Open weights VLMs such as Llama and Qwen catastrophically fail on our benchmark -- they perform only slightly better than a baseline in which an LLM hallucinates a reasoning chain with oracle knowledge of the photo location but no visual information at all. We believe the gap between human experts and VLMs on this task points to VLM limitations at extracting fine-grained visual attributes from high resolution images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u4e2a\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0VLMs\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u5ab2\u7f8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u7cdf\u7cd5\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u6765\u652f\u6301\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u5efa\u9996\u4e2a\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eGeoGuessr\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u5168\u7403\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u73a9\u5bb6\u5408\u4f5c\u521b\u5efa800\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LLM-as-a-judge\u548cVLM-as-a-judge\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u8bc4\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u578b\u95ed\u6e90VLMs\uff08\u5982Gemini\u548cGPT 5\uff09\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u5ab2\u7f8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u843d\u540e\uff1b\u5f00\u6e90VLMs\uff08\u5982Llama\u548cQwen\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u707e\u96be\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u4ec5\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1bQwen 3 LLM-as-a-judge\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e0eVLMs\u5728\u6b64\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u8868\u660eVLMs\u5728\u4ece\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u6307\u5411\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Current practice, however, relies on the cumbersome and error-prone process of manual tower inspections. We propose a novel paradigm shift that fuses video footage of base stations, antenna geometric features, and Physical Cell Identity (PCI) signals, transforming antenna affiliation identification into multi-modal classification and matching tasks. Publicly available pretrained transformers struggle with this unique task due to a lack of analogous data in the communications domain, which hampers cross-modal alignment. To address this, we introduce a dedicated training framework that aligns antenna images with corresponding PCI signals. To tackle the representation alignment challenge, we propose a novel Token Entropy Regularization module in the pretraining stage. Our experiments demonstrate that TER accelerates convergence and yields significant performance gains. Further analysis reveals that the entropy of the first token is modality-dependent.

We introduce WorldBench, a novel video-based benchmark specifically designed for concept-specific, disentangled evaluation, allowing us to rigorously isolate and assess understanding of a single physical concept or law at a time. To make WorldBench comprehensive, we design benchmarks at two different levels: 1) an evaluation of intuitive physical understanding with concepts such as object permanence or scale/perspective, and 2) an evaluation of low-level physical constants and material properties such as friction coefficients or fluid viscosity. When SOTA video-based world models are evaluated on WorldBench, we find specific patterns of failure in particular physics concepts, with all tested models lacking the physical consistency required to generate reliable real-world interactions.

Although deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA), effectively handling the sparse and irregular nature of input depth data in deep networks remains a significant challenge, often limiting performance, especially under high sparsity. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Gaussian Belief Propagation Network (GBPN), a novel hybrid framework synergistically integrating deep learning with probabilistic graphical models for end-to-end depth completion. Specifically, a scene-specific Markov Random Field (MRF) is dynamically constructed by the Graphical Model Construction Network (GMCN), and then inferred via Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) to yield the dense depth distribution. Crucially, the GMCN learns to construct not only the data-dependent potentials of MRF but also its structure by predicting adaptive non-local edges, enabling the capture of complex, long-range spatial dependencies.

Meeting this demand depends not only on increasing agricultural yield but also on minimizing food loss caused by crop diseases. Diseases account for a substantial portion of apple production losses, despite apples being among the most widely produced and nutritionally valuable fruits worldwide. Previous studies have employed machine learning techniques for feature extraction and early diagnosis of apple leaf diseases, and more recently, deep learning-based models have shown remarkable performance in disease recognition. However, most state-of-the-art deep learning models are highly parameter-intensive, resulting in increased training and inference time. Although lightweight models are more suitable for user-friendly and resource-constrained applications, they often suffer from performance degradation. To address the trade-off between efficiency and performance, we propose Mam-App, a parameter-efficient Mamba-based model for feature extraction and leaf disease classification. The proposed approach achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance on the PlantVillage Apple Leaf Disease dataset, attaining 99.58% accuracy, 99.30% precision, 99.14% recall, and a 99.22% F1-score, while using only 0.051M parameters. This extremely low parameter count makes the model suitable for deployment on drones, mobile devices, and other low-resource platforms. To demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the proposed model, we further evaluate it on the PlantVillage Corn Leaf Disease and Potato Leaf Disease datasets. The model achieves 99.48%, 99.20%, 99.34%, and 99.27% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the corn dataset and 98.46%, 98.91%, 95.39%, and 97.01% on the potato dataset, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMam-App\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eMamba\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u82f9\u679c\u53f6\u75c5\u5bb3\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u4eba\u53e3\u589e\u957f\u548c\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u7cae\u98df\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u82f9\u679c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u6c34\u679c\uff0c\u75c5\u5bb3\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u4ea7\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5927\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\uff0c\u800c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMam-App\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eMamba\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u53f6\u75c5\u5bb3\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u6781\u4f4e\uff08\u4ec50.051M\uff09\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u7b49\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "result": "\u5728PlantVillage\u82f9\u679c\u53f6\u75c5\u5bb3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523099.58%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u300199.30%\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u300199.14%\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c99.22% F1\u5206\u6570\uff1b\u5728\u7389\u7c73\u53f6\u75c5\u5bb3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523099.48%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u300199.20%\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u300199.34%\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c99.27% F1\u5206\u6570\uff1b\u5728\u9a6c\u94c3\u85af\u53f6\u75c5\u5bb3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523098.46%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u300198.91%\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u300195.39%\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c97.01% F1\u5206\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "Mam-App\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4e3a\u519c\u4e1a\u75c5\u5bb3\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We introduce the Latent Autoregressive Network (LANE), which incorporates compact autoregressive dependencies in the generation process, achieving a $6\\times$ improvement in maximum generatable sequence length compared to existing methods. To further accelerate inference, we propose the Adaptive Computation Graph Reconfiguration (AdaGraph) strategy, which effectively overcomes the efficiency bottleneck of traditional serial inference through spatiotemporal decoupling in the generation process.

Singularities in semi-discrete optimal transport (OT) mark regions of semantic ambiguity, where classifiers are particularly prone to unwarranted high-confidence predictions. Motivated by this observation, we propose a principled framework to mitigate OOD overconfidence by leveraging the geometry of OT-induced singular boundaries. Specifically, we formulate an OT problem between a continuous base distribution and the latent embeddings of training data, and identify the resulting singular boundaries.

A Pseudotime Analysis of Visual Representations", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "comment": "21 pages, 17 figures. Appendix included", "summary": "Vision foundation models trained on discretely sampled images achieve strong performance on classification benchmarks, yet whether their representations encode the continuous processes underlying their training data remains unclear. This question is especially pertinent in computational pathology, where we posit that models whose latent representations implicitly capture continuous disease progression may better reflect underlying biology, support more robust generalization, and enable quantitative analyses of features associated with disease transitions. Using diffusion pseudotime, a method developed to infer developmental trajectories from single-cell transcriptomics, we probe whether foundation models organize disease states along coherent progression directions in representation space. Across four cancer progressions and six models, we find that all pathology-specific models recover trajectory orderings significantly exceeding null baselines, with vision-only models achieving the highest fidelities $(\u03c4> 0.78$ on CRC-Serrated). Model rankings by trajectory fidelity on reference diseases strongly predict few-shot classification performance on held-out diseases ($\u03c1= 0.92$), and exploratory analysis shows cell-type composition varies smoothly along inferred trajectories in patterns consistent with known stromal remodeling. Together, these results demonstrate that vision foundation models can implicitly learn to represent continuous processes from independent static observations, and that trajectory fidelity provides a complementary measure of representation quality beyond downstream performance. While demonstrated in pathology, this framework could be applied to other domains where continuous processes are observed through static snapshots.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u4ece\u79bb\u6563\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u8fde\u7eed\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5176\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u75be\u75c5\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5176\u8868\u793a\u662f\u5426\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u9690\u5f0f\u6355\u6349\u8fde\u7eed\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u672c\u8d28\u3001\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u75be\u75c5\u8f6c\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u4f2a\u65f6\u95f4\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u63a8\u65ad\u53d1\u80b2\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6cbf\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75be\u75c5\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u764c\u75c7\u8fdb\u5c55\u548c\u516d\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u96f6\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u6062\u590d\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u6392\u5e8f\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8fc7\u96f6\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4ec5\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff08CRC-Serrated\u4e0a\u03c4>0.78\uff09\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53c2\u8003\u75be\u75c5\u4e0a\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6392\u540d\u80fd\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u75be\u75c5\u4e0a\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u03c1=0.92\uff09\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u7ec6\u80de\u7c7b\u578b\u7ec4\u6210\u6cbf\u63a8\u65ad\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e73\u6ed1\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5\u57fa\u8d28\u91cd\u5851\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u4ece\u72ec\u7acb\u9759\u6001\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e2d\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u793a\u8fde\u7eed\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u8865\u5145\u8861\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u5feb\u7167\u89c2\u5bdf\u8fde\u7eed\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

A dominant paradigm involves freezing a pre-trained model and training lightweight, task-specific adapters. However, maintaining task-specific parameters hinders knowledge transfer and incurs high retrieval costs, while naive parameter fusion often leads to destructive interference and catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamical Adapter Fusion (DAF) to construct a single robust global adapter. Grounded in the PAC-Bayes theorem, we derive a fusion mechanism that explicitly integrates three components: the optimized task-specific adapter parameters, the previous global adapter parameters, and the initialization parameters.

It directly grounds the 2D-to-3D pose lifting process with geometric cues from image features, producing a highly reliable 3D pose sequence that serves as a stable anchor. Second, the Motion-guided Reconstruction Network leverages this anchor to explicitly process kinematic patterns over time. By injecting this crucial temporal awareness, it significantly enhances the final mesh's coherence and robustness, particularly under occlusion and motion blur.

Existing methods primarily rely on geometry-aware feature learning or appearance-conditioned prompting, while implicitly assuming that the geometry-invariant dot-product similarity used in attention mechanisms remains reliable under large viewpoint and scale variations. We argue that this assumption does not hold. Extreme camera geometry systematically distorts the query-key similarity space and degrades attention-based matching, even when feature representations are partially aligned.\n  To address this issue, we introduce Geometry-Induced Query-Key Transformation (GIQT), a lightweight low-rank module that explicitly rectifies the similarity space by conditioning query-key interactions on camera geometry. Rather than modifying feature representations or the attention formulation itself, GIQT adapts the similarity computation to compensate for dominant geometry-induced anisotropic distortions. Building on this local similarity rectification, we further incorporate a geometry-conditioned prompt generation mechanism that provides global, view-adaptive representation priors derived directly from camera geometry.\n  Experiments on four aerial-ground person re-identification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under extreme and previously unseen geometric conditions, while introducing minimal computational overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGIQT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u673a\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u6821\u6b63\u67e5\u8be2-\u952e\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u4eba\u673a-\u5730\u9762\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7578\u53d8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e0e\u5730\u9762\u76f8\u673a\u95f4\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u51e0\u4f55\u7578\u53d8\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u70b9\u79ef\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u51e0\u4f55\u8bf1\u5bfc\u67e5\u8be2-\u952e\u53d8\u6362(GIQT)\uff1a1) \u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4f4e\u79e9\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u673a\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u6821\u6b63\u67e5\u8be2-\u952e\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b2) \u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u5c40\u89c6\u56fe\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8868\u793a\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a-\u5730\u9762\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u6700\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u6821\u6b63\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u6bd4\u4ec5\u8c03\u6574\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0cGIQT\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u6362\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6781\u7aef\u89c6\u89d2\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose UniMRG (Unified Multi-Representation Generation), a simple yet effective architecture-agnostic post-training method. UniMRG enhances the understanding capabilities of UMMs by incorporating auxiliary generation tasks. Specifically, we train UMMs to generate multiple intrinsic representations of input images, namely pixel (reconstruction), depth (geometry), and segmentation (structure), alongside standard visual understanding objectives. By synthesizing these diverse representations, UMMs capture complementary information regarding appearance, spatial relations, and structural layout.

We argue that AI-generated videos are essentially products of a manifold-fitting process rather than a physical recording. Consequently, the pixel composition logic of consecutive adjacent frames residual in AI videos exhibits a structured and homogenous characteristic. We term this phenomenon `Manifold Projection Fluctuations' (MPF). Driven by this insight, we propose a hierarchical dual-path framework that operates as a sequential filtering process. The first, the Static Manifold Deviation Branch, leverages the refined perceptual boundaries of Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to capture residual spatial anomalies or physical violations that deviate from the natural real-world manifold (off-manifold). For the remaining high-fidelity videos that successfully reside on-manifold and evade spatial detection, we introduce the Micro-Temporal Fluctuation Branch as a secondary, fine-grained filter.

However, their reliability for quantitative 3D analysis in dense, self-occluding scenes remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify a fundamental failure mode of implicit density fields under heavy occlusion, which we term Interior Geometric Degradation (IGD). We show that transmittance-based volumetric optimization satisfies photometric supervision by reconstructing hollow or fragmented structures rather than solid interiors, leading to systematic instance undercounting. Through controlled experiments on synthetic datasets with increasing occlusion, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art mask-supervised NeRFs saturate at approximately 89% instance recovery in dense scenes, despite improved surface coherence and mask quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an explicit geometric pipeline based on Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVRaster), initialized from SfM feature geometry. By projecting 2D instance masks onto an explicit voxel grid and enforcing geometric separation via recursive splitting, our approach preserves physical solidity and achieves a 95.8% recovery rate in dense clusters. A sensitivity analysis using degraded segmentation masks further shows that explicit SfM-based geometry is substantially more robust to supervision failure, recovering 43% more instances than implicit baselines. These results demonstrate that explicit geometric priors are a prerequisite for reliable quantitative analysis in highly self-occluding 3D scenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeRF\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8ba1\u6570\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8eSfM\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6062\u590d\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "NeRF\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u81ea\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf3D\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u672a\u77e5\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u5e76\u5bfb\u627e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u4f53\u7d20\u6805\u683c\u5316\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u4eceSfM\u7279\u5f81\u51e0\u4f55\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u5c062D\u5b9e\u4f8b\u63a9\u7801\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u663e\u5f0f\u4f53\u7d20\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u5206\u5272\u5f3a\u5236\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "result": "1) \u9690\u5f0f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u573a\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u906e\u6321\u4e0b\u53ea\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u7ea689%\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff1b2) \u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fbe\u523095.8%\u7684\u6062\u590d\u7387\uff1b3) \u663e\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u9000\u5316\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u6bd4\u9690\u5f0f\u57fa\u7ebf\u591a\u6062\u590d43%\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u81ea\u906e\u6321\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u662f\u53ef\u9760\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5148\u51b3\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u9690\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach that transforms unimodal datasets into multimodal ones using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate synthetic image captions for fine-tuning models with a multimodal objective. Our method employs carefully designed prompts incorporating class labels and domain context to produce high-quality captions tailored for classification tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a supervised contrastive loss function that explicitly encourages clustering of same-class representations during fine-tuning, along with a new inference technique that leverages class-averaged text embeddings from multiple synthetic captions per image. Extensive experiments across 13 image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods, with particularly significant improvements in few-shot learning scenarios.

Existing methods either compress visual embeddings or apply sparse attention on a single GPU, yielding limited acceleration or degraded performance and restricting LMMs from handling longer, more complex videos. To overcome these issues, we propose Spava, a sequence-parallel framework with optimized attention that accelerates long-video inference across multiple GPUs. By distributing approximate attention, Spava reduces computation and increases parallelism, enabling efficient processing of more visual embeddings without compression and thereby improving task performance. System-level optimizations, such as load balancing and fused forward passes, further unleash the potential of Spava, delivering speedups of 12.72x, 1.70x, and 1.18x over FlashAttn, ZigZagRing, and APB, without notable performance loss.

Accepted by ICASSP 2026", "summary": "Metric learning is central to retrieval, yet its effects on embedding geometry and optimization dynamics are not well understood. We introduce a diagnostic framework, VARIANCE (intra-/inter-class variance) and GREEDINESS (active ratio and gradient norms), to compare seven representative losses, i.e., Contrastive, Triplet, N-pair, InfoNCE, ArcFace, SCL, and CCL, across five image-retrieval datasets. Our analysis reveals that Triplet and SCL preserve higher within-class variance and clearer inter-class margins, leading to stronger top-1 retrieval in fine-grained settings.

The prohibitive cost of frame-level annotation makes weakly supervised methods a practical necessity, which rely only on video-level labels. To this end, we propose Reconstruction-based Temporal Deepfake Localization (RT-DeepLoc), a weakly supervised temporal forgery localization framework that identifies forgeries via reconstruction errors. Our framework uses a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) trained exclusively on authentic data to learn its intrinsic spatiotemporal patterns; this allows the model to produce significant reconstruction discrepancies for forged segments, effectively providing the missing fine-grained cues for localization. To robustly leverage these indicators, we introduce a novel Asymmetric Intra-video Contrastive Loss (AICL). By focusing on the compactness of authentic features guided by these reconstruction cues, AICL establishes a stable decision boundary that enhances local discrimination while preserving generalization to unseen forgeries.

The ability to generate crash-like imagery challenges the boundary between authentic and synthetic data, introducing new risks of misuse in fraud or claim manipulation. To address these issues, we propose HERS (Hidden-Pattern Expert Learning for Risk-Specific Damage Adaptation), a framework designed to improve fidelity, controllability, and domain alignment of diffusion-generated damage images. HERS fine-tunes a base diffusion model via domain-specific expert adaptation without requiring manual annotation. Using self-supervised image-text pairs automatically generated by a large language model and T2I pipeline, HERS models each damage category, such as dents, scratches, broken lights, or cracked paint, as a separate expert. These experts are later integrated into a unified multi-damage model that balances specialization with generalization.

However, their quadratic complexity in sequence length and the difficulty of interpreting attention weights limit both scalability and clarity. Recent attention-free architectures demonstrate that strong performance can be achieved without pairwise attention, motivating the search for alternatives. In this work, we introduce Vision KAN (ViK), an attention-free backbone inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. At its core lies MultiPatch-RBFKAN, a unified token mixer that combines (a) patch-wise nonlinear transform with Radial Basis Function-based KANs, (b) axis-wise separable mixing for efficient local propagation, and (c) low-rank global mapping for long-range interaction. Employing as a drop-in replacement for attention modules, this formulation tackles the prohibitive cost of full KANs on high-resolution features by adopting a patch-wise grouping strategy with lightweight operators to restore cross-patch dependencies.

However, their reliance on iterative Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solving creates a significant latency bottleneck. Existing solutions face a dichotomy: training-free solvers suffer from significant performance degradation at low Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs), while training-based one- or few-steps generation methods incur prohibitive training costs and lack plug-and-play versatility. To bridge this gap, we propose the Bi-Anchor Interpolation Solver (BA-solver). BA-solver retains the versatility of standard training-free solvers while achieving significant acceleration by introducing a lightweight SideNet (1-2% backbone size) alongside the frozen backbone. Specifically, our method is founded on two synergistic components: \\textbf{1) Bidirectional Temporal Perception}, where the SideNet learns to approximate both future and historical velocities without retraining the heavy backbone; and 2) Bi-Anchor Velocity Integration, which utilizes the SideNet with two anchor velocities to efficiently approximate intermediate velocities for batched high-order integration. By utilizing the backbone to establish high-precision ``anchors'' and the SideNet to densify the trajectory, BA-solver enables large interval sizes with minimized error. Empirical results on ImageNet-256^2 demonstrate that BA-solver achieves generation quality comparable to 100+ NFEs Euler solver in just 10 NFEs and maintains high fidelity in as few as 5 NFEs, incurring negligible training costs.

Existing methods are often constrained by coarse-grained control mechanisms or fixed mapping schedules, yielding suboptimal adaptation. To address this, we propose an Uncertainty-Aware Diffusion Bridge Model (UDBM), which innovatively reformulates AiOIR as a stochastic transport problem steered by pixel-wise uncertainty. By introducing a relaxed diffusion bridge formulation which replaces the strict terminal constraint with a relaxed constraint, we model the uncertainty of degradations while theoretically resolving the drift singularity inherent in standard diffusion bridges. Furthermore, we devise a dual modulation strategy: the noise schedule aligns diverse degradations into a shared high-entropy latent space, while the path schedule adaptively regulates the transport trajectory motivated by the viscous dynamics of entropy regularization. By effectively rectifying the transport geometry and dynamics, UDBM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse restoration tasks within a single inference step.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faUDBM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u968f\u673a\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49AiOIR\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u6784\u9000\u5316\u95f4\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "AiOIR\u9762\u4e34\u5f02\u6784\u9000\u5316\u95f4\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u6216\u56fa\u5b9a\u6620\u5c04\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b21\u4f18\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u6269\u6563\u6865\u6a21\u578b(UDBM)\uff0c\u5c06AiOIR\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u968f\u673a\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u677e\u5f1b\u6269\u6563\u6865\u516c\u5f0f\u89e3\u51b3\u6807\u51c6\u6269\u6563\u6865\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u5947\u5f02\u6027\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u91cd\u8c03\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u566a\u58f0\u8c03\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u9000\u5316\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u9ad8\u71b5\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8def\u5f84\u8c03\u5ea6\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u7c98\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u8282\u4f20\u8f93\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "UDBM\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u4fee\u6b63\u4f20\u8f93\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u591a\u79cd\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "UDBM\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u968f\u673a\u4f20\u8f93\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86AiOIR\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784\u9000\u5316\u6062\u590d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches relying on manual sampling or expensive commercial systems fail to address accessibility challenges in resource-constrained environments. This paper presents HydroSense, an innovative Internet of Things framework that integrates six critical water quality parameters including pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS), estimated nitrogen, and water level into a unified monitoring system. HydroSense employs a novel dual-microcontroller architecture, utilizing Arduino Uno for precision analog measurements with five-point calibration algorithms and ESP32 for wireless connectivity, edge processing, and cloud integration. The system implements advanced signal processing techniques including median filtering for TDS measurement, temperature compensation algorithms, and robust error handling. Experimental validation over 90 days demonstrates exceptional performance metrics: pH accuracy of plus or minus 0.08 units across the 0 to 14 range, DO measurement stability within plus or minus 0.2 mg/L, TDS accuracy of plus or minus 1.9 percent across 0 to 1000 ppm, and 99.8 percent cloud data transmission reliability. With a total implementation cost of 32,983 BDT (approximately 300 USD), HydroSense achieves an 85 percent cost reduction compared to commercial systems while providing enhanced connectivity through the Firebase real-time database.

To address these gaps, we propose WMVLM, the first unified and interpretable evaluation framework for diffusion model image watermarking via vision-language models (VLMs). We redefine quality and security metrics for each watermark type: residual watermarks are evaluated by artifact strength and erasure resistance, while semantic watermarks are assessed through latent distribution shifts.

However, current systems often reduce diagnosis to directly output conclusions without verifiable evidence-linked reasoning, which severely limits clinical trust and hinders expert error rectification. To address these barriers, we construct PathReasoner, the first large-scale dataset of whole-slide image (WSI) reasoning. Unlike previous work reliant on unverified distillation, we develop a rigorous knowledge-guided generation pipeline. By leveraging medical knowledge graphs, we explicitly align structured pathological findings and clinical reasoning with diagnoses, generating over 20K high-quality instructional samples. Based on the database, we propose PathReasoner-R1, which synergizes trajectory-masked supervised fine-tuning with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning to instill structured chain-of-thought capabilities. To ensure medical rigor, we engineer a knowledge-aware multi-granular reward function incorporating an Entity Reward mechanism strictly aligned with knowledge graphs.

While this literature shows that there is an area where model representations are similar, we study here how vision models might get to those representations -- in particular, do they also converge to the same intermediate steps and operations? We therefore study the processes that lead to convergent representations in different models. First, we quantify distance between different model representations at different stages. We follow the evolution of distances between models throughout processing, identifying the processing steps which are most different between models. We find that while layers at similar positions in different models have the most similar representations, strong differences remain. Classifier models, unlike the others, will discard information about low-level image statistics in their final layers. CNN- and transformer-based models also behave differently, with transformer models applying smoother changes to representations from one layer to the next. These distinctions clarify the level and nature of convergence between model representations, and enables a more qualitative account of the underlying processes in image models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u6536\u655b\u5230\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u6700\u7ec8\u8868\u793a\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8868\u793a\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u867d\u7136\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5c42\u8868\u793a\u6700\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u8868\u660e\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u6536\u655b\u5230\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\"\u901a\u7528\"\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fbe\u5230\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8868\u793a\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5bfc\u81f4\u8868\u793a\u6536\u655b\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u7684\u5f02\u540c\u3002", "method": "\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8868\u793a\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8868\u793a\u8ddd\u79bb\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u6700\u5927\u7684\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83CNN\u3001transformer\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5c42\u8868\u793a\u6700\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u5728\u6700\u540e\u51e0\u5c42\u4e22\u5f03\u4f4e\u5c42\u56fe\u50cf\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\uff0cCNN\u548ctransformer\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\uff0ctransformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c42\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u53d8\u5316\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u6536\u655b\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u5e95\u5c42\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6700\u7ec8\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u80fd\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

In recent ImageNet-scale AE studies, we observe a systematic bias toward generative metrics in handling this trade-off: reconstruction metrics are increasingly under-reported, and ablation-based AE selection often favors the best-gFID configuration even when reconstruction fidelity degrades. We theoretically analyze why this gFID-dominant preference can appear unproblematic for ImageNet generation, yet becomes risky when scaling to controllable diffusion: AEs can induce condition drift, which limits achievable condition alignment. Meanwhile, we find that reconstruction fidelity, especially instance-level measures, better indicates controllability. We empirically validate the impact of tilted autoencoder evaluation on controllability by studying several recent ImageNet AEs. Using a multi-dimensional condition-drift evaluation protocol reflecting controllable generation tasks, we find that gFID is only weakly predictive of condition preservation, whereas reconstruction-oriented metrics are substantially more aligned. ControlNet experiments further confirm that controllability tracks condition preservation rather than gFID. Overall, our results expose a gap between ImageNet-centric AE evaluation and the requirements of scalable controllable diffusion, offering practical guidance for more reliable benchmarking and model selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff1a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5f3a\u8c03\u751f\u6210\u53cb\u597d\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff08gFID\uff09\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u53ef\u63a7\u6269\u6563\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6761\u4ef6\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dImageNet\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\u751f\u6210\u53cb\u597d\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u4f4egFID\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u53ef\u63a7\u6269\u6563\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u8d77\u6761\u4ef6\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790gFID\u4e3b\u5bfc\u504f\u597d\u5728ImageNet\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u770b\u4f3c\u65e0\u5bb3\u4f46\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u6269\u6563\u4e2d\u5371\u9669\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff1b2\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u7ef4\u6761\u4ef6\u6f02\u79fb\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff1b3\uff09\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4e2a\u8fd1\u671fImageNet\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff1b4\uff09\u901a\u8fc7ControlNet\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1agFID\u5bf9\u6761\u4ef6\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u800c\u91cd\u5efa\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u4fdd\u6301\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\uff1bControlNet\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6761\u4ef6\u4fdd\u6301\u800c\u975egFID\uff1b\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u5ea6\u91cf\uff09\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u6307\u793a\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u4ee5ImageNet\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684AE\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u53ef\u63a7\u6269\u6563\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5e94\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u751f\u6210\u53cb\u597d\u6027\u3002"}}

Owing to the vast spatial scale and high semantic ambiguity of remote sensing scenes, these descriptions often rely heavily on positional cues, posing unique challenges for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in spatial reasoning. To leverage this unique feature, we propose a reasoning-guided, position-aware post-training framework, dubbed \\textbf{RSGround-R1}, to progressively enhance spatial understanding. Specifically, we first introduce Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT) using synthetically generated RSVG reasoning data to establish explicit position awareness.

However, existing OCR methods primarily focus on recognizing text elements from images or scanned documents (\\textbf{Text-centric OCR}), neglecting the identification of visual elements from visually information-dense image sources (\\textbf{Vision-centric OCR}), such as charts, web pages and science plots. In reality, these visually information-dense images are widespread on the internet and have significant real-world application value, such as data visualization and web page analysis. In this technical report, we propose \\textbf{OCRVerse}, the first holistic OCR method in end-to-end manner that enables unified text-centric OCR and vision-centric OCR. To this end, we constructe comprehensive data engineering to cover a wide range of text-centric documents, such as newspapers, magazines and books, as well as vision-centric rendered composites, including charts, web pages and scientific plots. Moreover, we propose a two-stage SFT-RL multi-domain training method for OCRVerse. SFT directly mixes cross-domain data to train and establish initial domain knowledge, while RL focuses on designing personalized reward strategies for the characteristics of each domain. Specifically, since different domains require various output formats and expected outputs, we provide sufficient flexibility in the RL stage to customize flexible reward signals for each domain, thereby improving cross-domain fusion and avoiding data conflicts. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of OCRVerse, achieving competitive results across text-centric and vision-centric data types, even comparable to large-scale open-source and closed-source models.", "AI": {"tldr": "OCRVerse\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5fc3OCR\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3OCR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5SFT-RL\u591a\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6587\u6863\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7ed3\u679c", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709OCR\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u6216\u626b\u63cf\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u6587\u672c\u5143\u7d20\uff08\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5fc3OCR\uff09\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4ece\u56fe\u8868\u3001\u7f51\u9875\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u8868\u7b49\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6e90\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u89c6\u89c9\u5143\u7d20\uff08\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3OCR\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u4e0a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOCRVerse\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5fc3OCR\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3OCR\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5de5\u7a0b\u8986\u76d6\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6587\u6863\uff08\u62a5\u7eb8\u3001\u6742\u5fd7\u3001\u4e66\u7c4d\uff09\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6e32\u67d3\u590d\u5408\u4f53\uff08\u56fe\u8868\u3001\u7f51\u9875\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u8868\uff09\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5SFT-RL\u591a\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aSFT\u76f4\u63a5\u6df7\u5408\u8de8\u57df\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5efa\u7acb\u521d\u59cb\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0cRL\u9636\u6bb5\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u57df\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9a\u5236\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eOCRVerse\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u4e0e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\u3002", "conclusion": "OCRVerse\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3OCR\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u57dfOCR\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u96c6\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While recent deep learning approaches for depression detection have shown promise, most rely on limited feature types, overlook explicit cross-modal interactions, and employ simple concatenation or static weighting for fusion.

CAF-Mamba not only captures cross-modal interactions explicitly and implicitly, but also dynamically adjusts modality contributions through a modality-wise attention mechanism, enabling more effective multimodal fusion.

Most existing methods for sMRI representation learning rely on 3D architectures (e.g., 3D CNNs), slice-wise feature extraction with late aggregation, or apply training-free feature extractions using 2D foundation models (e.g., DINO). However, these three paradigms suffer from high computational cost, loss of cross-slice relations, and limited ability to extract discriminative features, respectively. To address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Visual Surrogate Compression (MVSC). It learns to compress and adapt large 3D sMRI volumes into compact 2D features, termed as visual surrogates, which are better aligned with frozen 2D foundation models to extract powerful representations for final AD classification. MVSC has two key components: a Volume Context Encoder that captures global cross-slice context under textual guidance, and an Adaptive Slice Fusion module that aggregates slice-level information in a text-enhanced, patch-wise manner.

Enabling end-to-end chart editing according to user intent is of great practical value, yet remains challenging due to the need for both fine-grained control and global structural consistency. Most existing approaches adopt pipeline-based designs, where natural language or code serves as an intermediate representation, limiting their ability to faithfully execute complex edits. We introduce ChartE$^{3}$, an End-to-End Chart Editing benchmark that directly evaluates models without relying on intermediate natural language programs or code-level supervision. ChartE$^{3}$ focuses on two complementary editing dimensions: local editing, which involves fine-grained appearance changes such as font or color adjustments, and global editing, which requires holistic, data-centric transformations including data filtering and trend line addition.

Despite recent advancements, existing methods suffer from two fundamental challenges: (1) suboptimal motion injection strategies that lead to a trade-off between identity preservation and motion consistency, manifesting as a \"see-saw\", and (2) an over-reliance on explicit pose priors (e.g., skeletons), which inadequately capture intricate dynamics and hinder generalization to arbitrary, non-humanoid characters. To address these challenges, we present DreamActor-M2, a universal animation framework that reimagines motion conditioning as an in-context learning problem. Our approach follows a two-stage paradigm. First, we bridge the input modality gap by fusing reference appearance and motion cues into a unified latent space, enabling the model to jointly reason about spatial identity and temporal dynamics by leveraging the generative prior of foundational models. Second, we introduce a self-bootstrapped data synthesis pipeline that curates pseudo cross-identity training pairs, facilitating a seamless transition from pose-dependent control to direct, end-to-end RGB-driven animation. This strategy significantly enhances generalization across diverse characters and motion scenarios. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we further introduce AW Bench, a versatile benchmark encompassing a wide spectrum of characters types and motion scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamActor-M2 achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior visual fidelity and robust cross-domain generalization.

While widely adopted, these metrics reduce performance to a single scalar, failing to capture how ranking consistency varies across the local quality spectrum. For example, two IQA models may achieve identical SRCC values, yet one ranks high-quality images (related to high Mean Opinion Score, MOS) more reliably, while the other better discriminates image pairs with small quality/MOS differences (related to $|\u0394$MOS$|$). Such complementary behaviors are invisible under global metrics. Moreover, SRCC and PLCC are sensitive to test-sample quality distributions, yielding unstable comparisons across test sets. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{Granularity-Modulated Correlation (GMC)}, which provides a structured, fine-grained analysis of IQA performance. GMC includes: (1) a \\textbf{Granularity Modulator} that applies Gaussian-weighted correlations conditioned on absolute MOS values and pairwise MOS differences ($|\u0394$MOS$|$) to examine local performance variations, and (2) a \\textbf{Distribution Regulator} that regularizes correlations to mitigate biases from non-uniform quality distributions. The resulting \\textbf{correlation surface} maps correlation values as a joint function of MOS and $|\u0394$MOS$|$, providing a 3D representation of IQA performance. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that GMC reveals performance characteristics invisible to scalar metrics, offering a more informative and reliable paradigm for analyzing, comparing, and deploying IQA models.

To address this, we propose DGNav, a framework for Dynamic Topological Navigation, introducing a context-aware mechanism to modulate map density and connectivity on-the-fly. Our approach comprises two core innovations: (1) A Scene-Aware Adaptive Strategy that dynamically modulates graph construction thresholds based on the dispersion of predicted waypoints, enabling \"densification on demand\" in challenging environments; (2) A Dynamic Graph Transformer that reconstructs graph connectivity by fusing visual, linguistic, and geometric cues into dynamic edge weights, enabling the agent to filter out topological noise and enhancing instruction adherence. Extensive experiments on the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks demonstrate DGNav exhibits superior navigation performance and strong generalization capabilities. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm that our framework achieves an optimal trade-off between navigation efficiency and safe exploration.

However, most state-ofthe-art 3D reconstruction methods require multi-view supervision, annotated 3D ground truth, or are computationally intensive, making them impractical for real-time maritime deployment. In this work, we present an efficient pipeline for single-view 3D reconstruction of real ships by training entirely on synthetic data and requiring only a single view at inference. Our approach uses the Splatter Image network, which represents objects as sparse sets of 3D Gaussians for rapid and accurate reconstruction from single images. The model is first fine-tuned on synthetic ShapeNet vessels and further refined with a diverse custom dataset of 3D ships, bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real-world imagery. We integrate a state-of-the-art segmentation module based on YOLOv8 and custom preprocessing to ensure compatibility with the reconstruction network. Postprocessing steps include real-world scaling, centering, and orientation alignment, followed by georeferenced placement on an interactive web map using AIS metadata and homography-based mapping. Quantitative evaluation on synthetic validation data demonstrates strong reconstruction fidelity, while qualitative results on real maritime images from the ShipSG dataset confirm the potential for transfer to operational maritime settings. The final system provides interactive 3D inspection of real ships without requiring real-world 3D annotations. This pipeline provides an efficient, scalable solution for maritime monitoring and highlights a path toward real-time 3D ship visualization in practical applications.

However, open-source VLMs still lag behind proprietary systems, largely due to the lack of high-quality reasoning data. Existing datasets offer limited coverage of challenging domains such as STEM diagrams and visual puzzles, and lack consistent, long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations essential for eliciting strong reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMFineReason, a large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset comprising 1.8M samples and 5.1B solution tokens, featuring high-quality reasoning annotations distilled from Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking. The dataset is established via a systematic three-stage pipeline: (1) large-scale data collection and standardization, (2) CoT rationale generation, and (3) comprehensive selection based on reasoning quality and difficulty awareness. The resulting dataset spans STEM problems, visual puzzles, games, and complex diagrams, with each sample annotated with visually grounded reasoning traces. We fine-tune Qwen3-VL-Instruct on MMFineReason to develop MMFineReason-2B/4B/8B versions. Our models establish new state-of-the-art results for their size class.

Instead of suppressing diffusion updates or applying masking heuristics, our approach reinterprets diffusion as the evolution of stochastic trajectories through a structured latent space. By shaping the initial noise and its geometric alignment, background generation naturally avoids designated foreground regions, allowing readable content to remain intact without auxiliary mechanisms. To address the long-standing issue of stylistic drift across pages, we decouple style control from text conditioning and introduce cached style directions as persistent vectors in latent space. Once selected, these directions constrain diffusion trajectories to a shared stylistic subspace, ensuring consistent appearance across pages and editing iterations. This formulation eliminates the need for repeated prompt-based style specification and provides a more stable foundation for multi-page generation. Our framework admits a geometric and physical interpretation, where diffusion paths evolve on a latent manifold shaped by preferred directions, and foreground regions are rarely traversed as a consequence of trajectory initialization rather than explicit exclusion. The proposed method is training-free, compatible with existing diffusion backbones, and produces visually coherent, foreground-preserving results across complex documents.

Despite its empirical success, CFG relies on a heuristic linear extrapolation that is often sensitive to the guidance scale. In this work, we provide a principled interpretation of CFG through the lens of optimization. We demonstrate that the velocity field in flow matching corresponds to the gradient of a sequence of smoothed distance functions, which guides latent variables toward the scaled target image set. This perspective reveals that the standard CFG formulation is an approximation of this gradient, where the prediction gap, the discrepancy between conditional and unconditional outputs, governs guidance sensitivity. Leveraging this insight, we reformulate the CFG sampling as a homotopy optimization with a manifold constraint. This formulation necessitates a manifold projection step, which we implement via an incremental gradient descent scheme during sampling. To improve computational efficiency and stability, we further enhance this iterative process with Anderson Acceleration without requiring additional model evaluations. Our proposed methods are training-free and consistently refine generation fidelity, prompt alignment, and robustness to the guidance scale.

However, existing approaches generally rely on heuristic KV Cache policies, which ignore differences in token importance in long-term video generation. This leads to the loss of critical spatiotemporal information and the accumulation of redundant, invalid cache, thereby degrading video generation quality and efficiency. To address this limitation, we first observe that token contributions to video generation are highly time-heterogeneous and accordingly propose a novel Past- and Future-Informed KV Cache Policy (PaFu-KV). Specifically, PaFu-KV introduces a lightweight Salience Estimation Head distilled from a bidirectional teacher to estimate salience scores, allowing the KV cache to retain informative tokens while discarding less relevant ones.

Current defenses predominantly rely on the \"locality hypothesis\", suppressing isolated neurons or features. However, harmful semantics act as distributed, cross-layer circuits, rendering such localized interventions brittle and detrimental to utility. To bridge this gap, we propose \\textbf{TraceRouter}, a path-level framework that traces and disconnects the causal propagation circuits of illicit semantics. TraceRouter operates in three stages: (1) it pinpoints a sensitive onset layer by analyzing attention divergence; (2) it leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and differential activation analysis to disentangle and isolate malicious features; and (3) it maps these features to downstream causal pathways via feature influence scores (FIS) derived from zero-out interventions. By selectively suppressing these causal chains, TraceRouter physically severs the flow of harmful information while leaving orthogonal computation routes intact. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraceRouter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a superior trade-off between adversarial robustness and general utility.

This global-centric paradigm overlooks fine-grained interactions between local motion segments and individual body joints and text tokens, inevitably leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from the pyramidal process of human motion perception (from joint dynamics to segment coherence, and finally to holistic comprehension) and propose a novel Pyramidal Shapley-Taylor (PST) learning framework for fine-grained motion-language retrieval. Specifically, the framework decomposes human motion into temporal segments and spatial body joints, and learns cross-modal correspondences through progressive joint-wise and segment-wise alignment in a pyramidal fashion, effectively capturing both local semantic details and hierarchical structural relationships. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving precise alignment between motion segments and body joints and their corresponding text tokens.

However, the capability of video aesthetic quality assessment, which is a fundamental ability for human, remains underexplored for LMMs. To address this, we introduce VideoAesBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LMMs' understanding of video aesthetic quality. VideoAesBench has several significant characteristics: (1) Diverse content including 1,804 videos from multiple video sources including user-generated (UGC), AI-generated (AIGC), compressed, robotic-generated (RGC), and game videos. (2) Multiple question formats containing traditional single-choice questions, multi-choice questions, True or False questions, and a novel open-ended questions for video aesthetics description. (3) Holistic video aesthetics dimensions including visual form related questions from 5 aspects, visual style related questions from 4 aspects, and visual affectiveness questions from 3 aspects. Based on VideoAesBench, we benchmark 23 open-source and commercial large multimodal models. Our findings show that current LMMs only contain basic video aesthetics perception ability, their performance remains incomplete and imprecise.

Just noticeable difference (JND) characterizes the maximum imperceptible distortion for images under human or machine vision. Extending it to deep visual features naturally meets the above demand by providing a task-aligned tolerance boundary in feature space, offering a practical reference for controlling feature quality under constrained resources. We propose FeatJND, a task-aligned JND formulation that predicts the maximum tolerable per-feature perturbation map while preserving downstream task performance. We propose a FeatJND estimator at standardized split points and validate it across image classification, detection, and instance segmentation. Under matched distortion strength, FeatJND-based distortions consistently preserve higher task performance than unstructured Gaussian perturbations, and attribution visualizations suggest FeatJND can suppress non-critical feature regions. As an application, we further apply FeatJND to token-wise dynamic quantization and show that FeatJND-guided step-size allocation yields clear gains over random step-size permutation and global uniform step size under the same noise budget.

However, existing single-page document image rectification methods fail to capture the coupled geometric relationships between adjacent pages in books. In this work, we introduce BookNet, the first end-to-end deep learning framework specifically designed for dual-page book image rectification. BookNet adopts a dual-branch architecture with cross-page attention mechanisms, enabling it to estimate warping flows for both individual pages and the complete book spread, explicitly modeling how left and right pages influence each other.

However, existing approaches overlook a fundamental granularity mismatch between human and machine vision, where deep vision models emphasize semantic invariance by suppressing local texture information, whereas neural signals preserve an intricate mixture of low-level visual attributes and high-level semantic content. To address this mismatch, we propose Shallow Alignment, a novel contrastive learning strategy that aligns neural signals with intermediate representations of visual encoders rather than their final outputs, thereby striking a better balance between low-level texture details and high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Shallow Alignment significantly outperforms standard final-layer alignment, with performance gains ranging from 22% to 58% across diverse vision backbones. Notably, our approach effectively unlocks the scaling law in neural visual decoding, enabling decoding performance to scale predictably with the capacity of pre-trained vision backbones. We further conduct systematic empirical analyses to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the observed performance gains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faShallow Alignment\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u795e\u7ecf\u89c6\u89c9\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u89c6\u89c9\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u89c6\u89c9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff1a\u6df1\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u800c\u6291\u5236\u5c40\u90e8\u7eb9\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u795e\u7ecf\u4fe1\u53f7\u5219\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u4f4e\u5c42\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6df7\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faShallow Alignment\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4f4e\u5c42\u7eb9\u7406\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cShallow Alignment\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8303\u56f4\u572822%\u523058%\u4e4b\u95f4\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u9501\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u89c6\u89c9\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u4f7f\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u80fd\u591f\u968f\u7740\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0cShallow Alignment\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u89c6\u89c9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u89c6\u89c9\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002"}}

Intuitively, video world models provide the ability to imagine the near future by understanding the causality between actions and visual dynamics. Inspired by this, we introduce LingBot-VA, an autoregressive diffusion framework that learns frame prediction and policy execution simultaneously. Our model features three carefully crafted designs: (1) a shared latent space, integrating vision and action tokens, driven by a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, (2) a closed-loop rollout mechanism, allowing for ongoing acquisition of environmental feedback with ground-truth observations, (3) an asynchronous inference pipeline, parallelizing action prediction and motor execution to support efficient control. We evaluate our model on both simulation benchmarks and real-world scenarios, where it shows significant promise in long-horizon manipulation, data efficiency in post-training, and strong generalizability to novel configurations.

However, pretraining video world models for scene understanding has so far brought only limited improvements.

In this work, we propose Drive-JEPA, a framework that integrates Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with multimodal trajectory distillation for end-to-end driving. First, we adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving, pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Second, we introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories, with a momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. When evaluated on NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation combined with a simple transformer-based decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting.

We ask a fundamental question: how much information about the future is already encoded in a single frame, and how can it be effectively exploited? Building on our prior work on Action Anticipation at a Glimpse (AAG), we conduct a systematic investigation of single-frame action anticipation enriched with complementary sources of information. We analyze the contribution of RGB appearance, depth-based geometric cues, and semantic representations of past actions, and investigate how different multimodal fusion strategies, keyframe selection policies and past-action history sources influence anticipation performance. Guided by these findings, we consolidate the most effective design choices into AAG+, a refined single-frame anticipation framework. Despite operating on a single frame, AAG+ consistently improves upon the original AAG and achieves performance comparable to, or exceeding, that of state-of-the-art video-based methods on challenging anticipation benchmarks including IKEA-ASM, Meccano and Assembly101.

However, existing NSR methods often suffer from geometric ambiguity and instability, particularly under sparse-view conditions. This issue is critical in large-scale urban remote sensing, where aerial image acquisition is limited by flight paths, terrain, and cost. To address this challenge, we present the first urban NSR framework that fuses 3D synthetic aperture radar (SAR) point clouds with aerial imagery for high-fidelity reconstruction under constrained, sparse-view settings. 3D SAR can efficiently capture large-scale geometry even from a single side-looking flight path, providing robust priors that complement photometric cues from images. Our framework integrates radar-derived spatial constraints into an SDF-based NSR backbone, guiding structure-aware ray selection and adaptive sampling for stable and efficient optimization. We also construct the first benchmark dataset with co-registered 3D SAR point clouds and aerial imagery, facilitating systematic evaluation of cross-modal 3D reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that incorporating 3D SAR markedly enhances reconstruction accuracy, completeness, and robustness compared with single-modality baselines under highly sparse and oblique-view conditions, highlighting a viable route toward scalable high-fidelity urban reconstruction with advanced airborne and spaceborne optical-SAR sensing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u4e2a\u878d\u54083D SAR\u70b9\u4e91\u4e0e\u822a\u7a7a\u5f71\u50cf\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u57ce\u5e02\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u822a\u7a7a\u5f71\u50cf\u91c7\u96c6\u53d7\u98de\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3001\u5730\u5f62\u548c\u6210\u672c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u57ce\u5e023D\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u878d\u54083D\u5408\u6210\u5b54\u5f84\u96f7\u8fbe\u70b9\u4e91\u4e0e\u822a\u7a7a\u5f71\u50cf\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u96f7\u8fbe\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u57fa\u4e8eSDF\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5149\u7ebf\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u878d\u54083D SAR\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u503e\u659c\u89c6\u89d2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5229\u7528\u5148\u8fdb\u673a\u8f7d\u548c\u661f\u8f7d\u5149\u5b66-SAR\u4f20\u611f\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u57ce\u5e02\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u914d\u51c6\u76843D SAR\u70b9\u4e91\u4e0e\u822a\u7a7a\u5f71\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6"}}

We present PLANING, an efficient on-the-fly reconstruction framework built on a hybrid representation that loosely couples explicit geometric primitives with neural Gaussians, enabling geometry and appearance to be modeled in a decoupled manner. This decoupling supports an online initialization and optimization strategy that separates geometry and appearance updates, yielding stable streaming reconstruction with substantially reduced structural redundancy. PLANING improves dense mesh Chamfer-L2 by 18.52% over PGSR, surpasses ARTDECO by 1.31 dB PSNR, and reconstructs ScanNetV2 scenes in under 100 seconds, over 5x faster than 2D Gaussian Splatting, while matching the quality of offline per-scene optimization. Beyond reconstruction quality, the structural clarity and computational efficiency of \\modelname~make it well suited for a broad range of downstream applications, such as enabling large-scale scene modeling and simulation-ready environments for embodied AI.

We introduce Metric Anything, a simple and scalable pretraining framework that learns metric depth from noisy, diverse 3D sources without manually engineered prompts, camera-specific modeling, or task-specific architectures. Central to our approach is the Sparse Metric Prompt, created by randomly masking depth maps, which serves as a universal interface that decouples spatial reasoning from sensor and camera biases. Using about 20M image-depth pairs spanning reconstructed, captured, and rendered 3D data across 10000 camera models, we demonstrate-for the first time-a clear scaling trend in the metric depth track. The pretrained model excels at prompt-driven tasks such as depth completion, super-resolution and Radar-camera fusion, while its distilled prompt-free student achieves state-of-the-art results on monocular depth estimation, camera intrinsics recovery, single/multi-view metric 3D reconstruction, and VLA planning. We also show that using pretrained ViT of Metric Anything as a visual encoder significantly boosts Multimodal Large Language Model capabilities in spatial intelligence. These results show that metric depth estimation can benefit from the same scaling laws that drive modern foundation models, establishing a new path toward scalable and efficient real-world metric perception.

We investigate this in the context of diffusion-based models that learn factorized latent spaces without factor-level supervision. In images, factors can capture background, illumination, and object attributes; in robotic videos, they can capture reusable motion components. To improve both latent factor discovery and quality of compositional generation, we introduce an adversarial training signal via a discriminator trained to distinguish between single-source samples and those generated by recombining factors across sources.

However, constrained by the capacity of their internal world knowledge, prior work has proposed augmenting MLLMs by ``reasoning-then-tool-call'' for visual and textual search engines to obtain substantial gains on tasks requiring extensive factual information. However, these approaches typically define multimodal search in a naive setting, assuming that a single full-level or entity-level image query and few text query suffices to retrieve the key evidence needed to answer the question, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios with substantial visual noise. Moreover, they are often limited in the reasoning depth and search breadth, making it difficult to solve complex questions that require aggregating evidence from diverse visual and textual sources. Building on this, we propose Vision-DeepResearch, which proposes one new multimodal deep-research paradigm, i.e., performs multi-turn, multi-entity and multi-scale visual and textual search to robustly hit real-world search engines under heavy noise. Our Vision-DeepResearch supports dozens of reasoning steps and hundreds of engine interactions, while internalizing deep-research capabilities into the MLLM via cold-start supervision and RL training, resulting in a strong end-to-end multimodal deep-research MLLM. It substantially outperforming existing multimodal deep-research MLLMs, and workflows built on strong closed-source foundation model such as GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-4-Sonnet.

While integrating object detectors as prompt generators offers a pathway to automation, existing pipelines suffer from two fundamental limitations: objective mismatch, where detectors optimized for geometric localization do not correspond to the optimal prompting context required by SAM, and alignment overfitting in standard joint training, where the detector simply memorizes specific prompt adjustments for training samples rather than learning a generalizable policy. To bridge this gap, we introduce BLO-Inst, a unified framework that aligns detection and segmentation objectives by bi-level optimization. We formulate the alignment as a nested optimization problem over disjoint data splits. In the lower level, the SAM is fine-tuned to maximize segmentation fidelity given the current detection proposals on a subset ($D_1$). In the upper level, the detector is updated to generate bounding boxes that explicitly minimize the validation loss of the fine-tuned SAM on a separate subset ($D_2$). This effectively transforms the detector into a segmentation-aware prompt generator, optimizing the bounding boxes not just for localization accuracy, but for downstream mask quality.

Existing reference-based image generation methods leverage large-scale pretrained diffusion models and demonstrate strong capability in generating diverse images conditioned on a single reference image. However, these methods are limited to single-image references and cannot leverage 3D assets, constraining their practical versatility. To address this gap, we present a cross-domain diffusion model with dual-branch perception that leverages multi-view RGB images and point maps of 3D assets to jointly model their colors and canonical-space coordinates, achieving precise consistency between generated images and the 3D references. Our spatially aligned dual-branch generation architecture and domain-decoupled generation mechanism ensure the simultaneous generation of two spatially aligned but content-disentangled outputs, RGB images and point maps, linking 2D image attributes with 3D asset attributes. Experiments show that our approach effectively uses 3D assets as references to produce images consistent with the given assets, opening new possibilities for combining diffusion models with 3D content creation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a3D\u8d44\u4ea7\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u70b9\u4e91\u56fe\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b02D\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0e3D\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u75283D\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5c063D\u8d44\u4ea7\u6574\u5408\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8de8\u57df\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u611f\u77e5\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u591a\u89c6\u89d2RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u56fe\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u989c\u8272\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u7a7a\u95f4\u5750\u6807\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u751f\u6210\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u57df\u89e3\u8026\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f46\u5185\u5bb9\u89e3\u8026\u7684RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u75283D\u8d44\u4ea7\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7ed9\u5b9a\u8d44\u4ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e3D\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u7ed3\u5408\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5c063D\u8d44\u4ea7\u6574\u5408\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e862D\u56fe\u50cf\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0e3D\u8d44\u4ea7\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u94fe\u63a5\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e3D\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Retrospective reviews of prediagnostic CT scans, when conducted by expert radiologists aware that the patient later developed PDAC, frequently reveal lesions that were previously overlooked. To help detecting these lesions earlier, we developed an automated system named ePAI (early Pancreatic cancer detection with Artificial Intelligence). It was trained on data from 1,598 patients from a single medical center. In the internal test involving 1,009 patients, ePAI achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.939-0.999, a sensitivity of 95.3%, and a specificity of 98.7% for detecting small PDAC less than 2 cm in diameter, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 2 mm. In an external test involving 7,158 patients across 6 centers, ePAI achieved an AUC of 0.918-0.945, a sensitivity of 91.5%, and a specificity of 88.0%, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 5 mm. Importantly, ePAI detected PDACs on prediagnostic CT scans obtained 3 to 36 months before clinical diagnosis that had originally been overlooked by radiologists. It successfully detected and localized PDACs in 75 of 159 patients, with a median lead time of 347 days before clinical diagnosis. Our multi-reader study showed that ePAI significantly outperformed 30 board-certified radiologists by 50.3% (P < 0.05) in sensitivity while maintaining a comparable specificity of 95.4% in detecting PDACs early and prediagnostic. These findings suggest its potential of ePAI as an assistive tool to improve early detection of pancreatic cancer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aePAI\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7528\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u80f0\u817a\u764c\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2dAUC\u8fbe0.939-0.999\uff0c\u5916\u90e8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2dAUC\u8fbe0.918-0.945\uff0c\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u76f4\u5f84\u5c0f\u81f32-5mm\u7684\u75c5\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u524d3-36\u4e2a\u6708\u53d1\u73b0\u88ab\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u6f0f\u8bca\u7684\u75c5\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u80f0\u817a\u5bfc\u7ba1\u817a\u764c\uff08PDAC\uff09\u662f\u6700\u81f4\u547d\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u6076\u6027\u80bf\u7624\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u665a\u671f\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u624b\u672f\u9636\u6bb5\u624d\u88ab\u53d1\u73b0\u3002\u56de\u987e\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u5728\u77e5\u9053\u60a3\u8005\u540e\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u4e3aPDAC\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u80fd\u5728\u4e4b\u524d\u7684CT\u626b\u63cf\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u75c5\u53d8\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u5e2e\u52a9\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u75c5\u53d8\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aePAI\uff08\u65e9\u671f\u80f0\u817a\u764c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6765\u81ea\u5355\u4e00\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u5fc3\u76841,598\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff081,009\u540d\u60a3\u8005\uff09\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff086\u4e2a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u76847,158\u540d\u60a3\u8005\uff09\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e30\u540d\u8ba4\u8bc1\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u8bfb\u8005\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5185\u90e8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cePAI\u5bf9\u5c0f\u4e8e2cm\u7684PDAC\u68c0\u6d4bAUC\u4e3a0.939-0.999\uff0c\u654f\u611f\u602795.3%\uff0c\u7279\u5f02\u602798.7%\uff0c\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5c0f\u81f32mm\u7684\u75c5\u53d8\u3002\u5916\u90e8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2dAUC\u4e3a0.918-0.945\uff0c\u654f\u611f\u602791.5%\uff0c\u7279\u5f02\u602788.0%\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5c0f\u81f35mm\u7684\u75c5\u53d8\u3002ePAI\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u524d3-36\u4e2a\u6708\u7684CT\u626b\u63cf\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u88ab\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u6f0f\u8bca\u7684PDAC\uff0c\u5728159\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e8675\u4f8b\uff0c\u4e2d\u4f4d\u63d0\u524d\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a347\u5929\u3002\u591a\u8bfb\u8005\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793aePAI\u654f\u611f\u6027\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e30\u540d\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f50.3%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u630195.4%\u7684\u53ef\u6bd4\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ePAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u80f0\u817a\u764c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4b\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u6f0f\u8bca\u7684\u5fae\u5c0f\u75c5\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u524d\u8bca\u65ad\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u8868\u660eePAI\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u6539\u5584\u80f0\u817a\u764c\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Existing attempts to bridge the synthetic-to-real gap for full-scene relighting remain suboptimal. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Physics-Inspired diffusion for full-image reLight ($\u03c0$-Light, or PI-Light), a two-stage framework that leverages physics-inspired diffusion models. Our design incorporates (i) batch-aware attention, which improves the consistency of intrinsic predictions across a collection of images, (ii) a physics-guided neural rendering module that enforces physically plausible light transport, (iii) physics-inspired losses that regularize training dynamics toward a physically meaningful landscape, thereby enhancing generalizability to real-world image editing, and (iv) a carefully curated dataset of diverse objects and scenes captured under controlled lighting conditions. Together, these components enable efficient finetuning of pretrained diffusion models while also providing a solid benchmark for downstream evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that $\u03c0$-Light synthesizes specular highlights and diffuse reflections across a wide variety of materials, achieving superior generalization to real-world scenes compared with prior approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u03c0-Light\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5149\u7167\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u6279\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5168\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u7684\u4e09\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u56f0\u96be\u3001\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u9762\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u6279\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u5185\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u795e\u7ecf\u6e32\u67d3\u6a21\u5757\u786e\u4fdd\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u5149\u4f20\u8f93\uff1b3\uff09\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u89c4\u8303\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\uff1b4\uff09\u7cbe\u5fc3\u7b56\u5212\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\u96c6", "result": "\u03c0-Light\u80fd\u591f\u5408\u6210\u5404\u79cd\u6750\u8d28\u7684\u9ad8\u5149\u548c\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u903c\u771f\u7684\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u6548\u679c", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5168\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u6e38\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b"}}

To move from observations to systematic understanding, this paper introduces VI-Probe, a controllable visual-illusion framework with graded perturbations and matched visual controls (without illusion inducer) that disentangles visually grounded perception from language-driven recall. Unlike prior work that focuses on averaged accuracy, we measure stability and sensitivity using Polarity-Flip Consistency, Template Fixation Index, and an illusion multiplier normalized against matched controls. Experiments across different families reveal that response persistence arises from heterogeneous causes rather than a single mechanism. For instance, GPT-5 exhibits memory override, Claude-Opus-4.1 shows perception-memory competition, while Qwen variants suggest visual-processing limits. Our findings challenge single-cause views and motivate probing-based evaluation that measures both knowledge and sensitivity to controlled visual change.

UEval comprises 1,000 expert-curated questions that require both images and text in the model output, sourced from 8 real-world tasks. Our curated questions cover a wide range of reasoning types, from step-by-step guides to textbook explanations. Evaluating open-ended multimodal generation is non-trivial, as simple LLM-as-a-judge methods can miss the subtleties. Different from previous works that rely on multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to rate image quality or text accuracy, we design a rubric-based scoring system in UEval. For each question, reference images and text answers are provided to a MLLM to generate an initial rubric, consisting of multiple evaluation criteria, and human experts then refine and validate these rubrics. In total, UEval contains 10,417 validated rubric criteria, enabling scalable and fine-grained automatic scoring. UEval is challenging for current unified models: GPT-5-Thinking scores only 66.4 out of 100, while the best open-source model reaches merely 49.1. We observe that reasoning models often outperform non-reasoning ones, and transferring reasoning traces from a reasoning model to a non-reasoning model significantly narrows the gap.

Deep learning can accelerate imaging by reconstructing spectra from rapid, single-scan inputs. However, separating noise and baseline drift simultaneously without ground truth is an ill-posed inverse problem. Standard black-box architectures often rely on statistical approximations that introduce spectral hallucinations or fail to generalize to unstable atmospheric conditions. To solve these issues we propose a physics-informed cascade Unet that separates denoising and baseline correction tasks using a new, deterministic Physics Bridge. This architecture forces the network to separate random noise from chemical signals using an embedded SNIP layer to enforce spectroscopic constraints instead of learning statistical approximations. We benchmarked this approach against a standard single Unet and a traditional Savitzky-Golay/SNIP workflow. We used a dataset of human hypopharyngeal carcinoma cells (FaDu). The cascade model outperformed all other methods, achieving a 51.3% reduction in RMSE compared to raw single-scan inputs, surpassing both the single Unet (40.2%) and the traditional workflow (33.7%). Peak-aware metrics show that the cascade architecture eliminates spectral hallucinations found in standard deep learning. It also preserves peak intensity with much higher fidelity than traditional smoothing. These results show that the cascade Unet is a robust solution for diagnostic-grade FTIR imaging.

While \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" offers scalability, judge imperfections, noise, and bias can invalidate statistical guarantees. We introduce a \"Noisy but Valid\" hypothesis testing framework to address this. By leveraging a small human-labelled calibration set to estimate the judge's True Positive and False Positive Rates (TPR/FPR), we derive a variance-corrected critical threshold applied to a large judge-labelled dataset. Crucially, our framework theoretically guarantees finite-sample Type-I error control (validity) despite calibration uncertainty. This distinguishes our work from Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), positioning our method as a diagnostic tool that explicitly models judge behavior rather than a black-box estimator. Our contributions include: (1) Theoretical Guarantees: We derive the exact conditions under which noisy testing yields higher statistical power than direct evaluation; (2) Empirical Validation: Experiments on Jigsaw Comment, Hate Speech and SafeRLHF confirm our theory; (3) The Oracle Gap: We reveal a significant performance gap between practical methods and the theoretical \"Oracle\" (perfectly known judge parameters), quantifying the cost of estimation. Specifically, we provide the first systematic treatment of the imperfect-judge setting, yielding interpretable diagnostics of judge reliability and clarifying how evaluation power depends on judge quality, dataset size, and certification levels. Together, these results sharpen understanding of statistical evaluation with LLM judges, and highlight trade-offs among competing inferential tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\"\u5608\u6742\u4f46\u6709\u6548\"\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728LLM\u6cd5\u5b98\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8ba4\u8bc1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u7c7b\u578bI\u9519\u8bef\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9700\u8981\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6545\u969c\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u4f7f\u7528\"LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6cd5\u5b98\"\u8fdb\u884c\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\uff0c\u6cd5\u5b98\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u504f\u89c1\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u6cd5\u5b98\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u578b\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6821\u51c6\u96c6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6cd5\u5b98\u7684\u771f\u9633\u6027\u7387\u548c\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7387\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u65b9\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u9608\u503c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u6cd5\u5b98\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u660e\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u6cd5\u5b98\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u7c7b\u578bI\u9519\u8bef\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5608\u6742\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\u7684\u786e\u5207\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u5728Jigsaw Comment\u3001Hate Speech\u548cSafeRLHF\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\"Oracle\"\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u4f30\u8ba1\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6cd5\u5b98\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6cd5\u5b98\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u529f\u6548\u5982\u4f55\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6cd5\u5b98\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u6cd5\u5b98\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

In this work, we formulate visual reasoning by means of video generation models, positing that generated frames can act as intermediate reasoning steps between initial states and solutions. We evaluate their capacity in two distinct regimes: Maze Navigation for sequential discrete planning with low visual change and Tangram Puzzle for continuous manipulation with high visual change. Our experiments reveal three critical insights: (1) Robust Zero-Shot Generalization: In both tasks, the model demonstrates strong performance on unseen data distributions without specific finetuning. (2) Visual Context: The model effectively uses visual context as explicit control, such as agent icons and tangram shapes, enabling it to maintain high visual consistency and adapt its planning capability robustly to unseen patterns. (3) Visual Test-Time Scaling: We observe a test-time scaling law in sequential planning; increasing the generated video length (visual inference budget) empowers better zero-shot generalization to spatially and temporally complex paths.

Most public datasets remain limited by simulated data sources, single-modality sensing, or the absence of fine-grained object-level annotations, which prevents robust scene understanding and multimodal safety reasoning for industrial foundation models. To address these limitations, InspecSafe-V1 is released as the first multimodal benchmark dataset for industrial inspection safety assessment that is collected from routine operations of real inspection robots in real-world environments. InspecSafe-V1 covers five representative industrial scenarios, including tunnels, power facilities, sintering equipment, oil and gas petrochemical plants, and coal conveyor trestles. The dataset is constructed from 41 wheeled and rail-mounted inspection robots operating at 2,239 valid inspection sites, yielding 5,013 inspection instances.

In this paper, we propose TrajPrint, a completely lossless and training-free framework that verifies model copyright by extracting unique manifold fingerprints formed during deterministic generation. Specifically, we first utilize a watermarked image as an anchor and exactly trace the path back to its trajectory origin, effectively locking the model fingerprint mapped by this path. Subsequently, we implement a joint optimization strategy that employs dual-end anchoring to synthesize a specific fingerprint noise, which strictly adheres to the target manifold for robust watermark recovery. As input, it enables the protected target model to recover the watermarked image, while failing on non-target models. Finally, we achieved verification via atomic inference and statistical hypothesis testing.

However, large models demand substantial GPU memory and exhibit high inference latency, while conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggles to bridge the capability gaps of small models. To address these limitations, we propose Drive-KD, a framework that decomposes autonomous driving into a \"perception-reasoning-planning\" triad and transfers these capabilities via knowledge distillation. We identify layer-specific attention as the distillation signal to construct capability-specific single-teacher models that outperform baselines. Moreover, we unify these single-teacher settings into a multi-teacher distillation framework and introduce asymmetric gradient projection to mitigate cross-capability gradient conflicts. Extensive evaluations validate the generalization of our method across diverse model families and scales.

While adversarial transfer within neural networks is well-documented, whether classical ML pipelines using handcrafted features inherit this vulnerability when attacked via neural surrogates remains unexplored. Feature engineering creates information bottlenecks through gradient quantization and spatial binning, potentially filtering high-frequency adversarial signals. We evaluate this hypothesis through the first comprehensive study of adversarial transfer from DNNs to HOG-based classifiers. Using VGG16 as a surrogate, we generate FGSM and PGD adversarial examples and test transfer to four classical classifiers (KNN, Decision Tree, Linear SVM, Kernel SVM) and a shallow neural network across eight HOG configurations on CIFAR-10. Our results strongly refute the protective hypothesis: all classifiers suffer 16.6%-59.1% relative accuracy drops, comparable to neural-to-neural transfer. More surprisingly, we discover attack hierarchy reversal--contrary to patterns where iterative PGD dominates FGSM within neural networks, FGSM causes greater degradation than PGD in 100% of classical ML cases, suggesting iterative attacks overfit to surrogate-specific features that don't survive feature extraction. Block normalization provides partial but insufficient mitigation.

However, deploying these advanced models in latency-critical MVA scenarios presents significant challenges. Unlike traditional CNN-based offloading paradigms where network transmission is the primary bottleneck, ViT-based systems are constrained by substantial inference delays, particularly for dense prediction tasks where the need for high-resolution inputs exacerbates the inherent quadratic computational complexity of ViTs. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic mixed-resolution inference strategy tailored for ViT-backboned dense prediction models, enabling flexible runtime trade-offs between speed and accuracy. Building on this, we introduce ViTMAlis, a ViT-native device-to-edge offloading framework that dynamically adapts to network conditions and video content to jointly reduce transmission and inference delays. We implement a fully functional prototype of ViTMAlis on commodity mobile and edge devices. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art accuracy-centric, content-aware, and latency-adaptive baselines, ViTMAlis significantly reduces end-to-end offloading latency while improving user-perceived rendering accuracy, providing a practical foundation for next-generation mobile intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "ViTMAlis\uff1a\u9762\u5411ViT\u9aa8\u5e72\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u5907-\u8fb9\u7f18\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6e32\u67d3\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u5e94\u7528\u6b63\u4eceCNN\u8f6c\u5411ViT\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u5176\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46ViT\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u9762\u4e34\u5de8\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u5378\u8f7d\u8303\u5f0f\u4ee5\u7f51\u7edc\u4f20\u8f93\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u800cViT\u7cfb\u7edf\u5219\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u663e\u8457\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8f93\u5165\u9700\u6c42\u52a0\u5267\u4e86ViT\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9ViT\u9aa8\u5e72\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6743\u8861\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1ViTMAlis\u6846\u67b6\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e2aViT\u539f\u751f\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u5230\u8fb9\u7f18\u5378\u8f7d\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002\u5728\u5546\u7528\u79fb\u52a8\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u529f\u80fd\u539f\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cViTMAlis\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5378\u8f7d\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u79fb\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "ViTMAlis\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u548cViT\u539f\u751f\u8bbe\u5907-\u8fb9\u7f18\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86ViT\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, a formal explanation of why the optimal target depends on the specific properties of the data remains elusive. In this work, we provide a theoretical framework based on a generalized prediction formulation that accommodates arbitrary output targets, of which $\\varepsilon$-, v-, and x-prediction are special cases. We derive the analytical relationship between data's geometry and the optimal prediction target, offering a rigorous justification for why x-prediction becomes superior when the ambient dimension significantly exceeds the data's intrinsic dimension. Furthermore, while our theory identifies dimensionality as the governing factor for the optimal prediction target, the intrinsic dimension of manifold-bound data is typically intractable to estimate in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose k-Diff, a framework that employs a data-driven approach to learn the optimal prediction parameter k directly from data, bypassing the need for explicit dimension estimation.

The Gray-Wyner network, a classical concept from information theory, offers a principled framework for separating common and task-specific information. Inspired by this idea, we develop a learnable three-channel codec that disentangles shared information from task-specific details across multiple vision tasks. We characterize the limits of this approach through the notion of lossy common information, and propose an optimization objective that balances inherent tradeoffs in learning such representations. Through comparisons of three codec architectures on two-task scenarios spanning six vision benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach substantially reduces redundancy and consistently outperforms independent coding.

Effective integration of 4D radar with cameras requires accurate extrinsic calibration, and the development of radar-based perception algorithms demands large-scale annotated datasets. However, existing calibration methods often employ separate targets optimized for either visual or radar modalities, complicating correspondence establishment. Furthermore, manually labeling sparse radar data is labor-intensive and unreliable. To address these challenges, we propose 4D-CAAL, a unified framework for 4D radar-camera calibration and auto-labeling. Our approach introduces a novel dual-purpose calibration target design, integrating a checkerboard pattern on the front surface for camera detection and a corner reflector at the center of the back surface for radar detection. We develop a robust correspondence matching algorithm that aligns the checkerboard center with the strongest radar reflection point, enabling accurate extrinsic calibration. Subsequently, we present an auto-labeling pipeline that leverages the calibrated sensor relationship to transfer annotations from camera-based segmentations to radar point clouds through geometric projection and multi-feature optimization.

We show that existing encoder-based attacks can substantially overestimate the robustness of compressed LVLMs, due to an optimization-inference mismatch: perturbations are optimized on the full-token representation, while inference is performed through a token-compression bottleneck. To address this gap, we propose the Compression-AliGnEd attack (CAGE), which aligns perturbation optimization with compression inference without assuming access to the deployed compression mechanism or its token budget. CAGE combines (i) expected feature disruption, which concentrates distortion on tokens likely to survive across plausible budgets, and (ii) rank distortion alignment, which actively aligns token distortions with rank scores to promote the retention of highly distorted evidence. Across diverse representative plug-and-play compression mechanisms and datasets, our results show that CAGE consistently achieves lower robust accuracy than the baseline.

However, most prior work focuses on static image understanding, while their ability to process sequential audio-video data remains underexplored. This gap highlights the need for a high-quality benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLM performance in a real-world setting. We introduce SONIC-O1, a comprehensive, fully human-verified benchmark spanning 13 real-world conversational domains with 4,958 annotations and demographic metadata. SONIC-O1 evaluates MLLMs on key tasks, including open-ended summarization, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and temporal localization with supporting rationales (reasoning). Experiments on closed- and open-source models reveal limitations. While the performance gap in MCQ accuracy between two model families is relatively small, we observe a substantial 22.6% performance difference in temporal localization between the best performing closed-source and open-source models. Performance further degrades across demographic groups, indicating persistent disparities in model behavior. Overall, SONIC-O1 provides an open evaluation suite for temporally grounded and socially robust multimodal understanding.

However, this setting confines agents to a passive role, limiting their autonomy and ability to react to dynamic environmental events. To address these limitations, we introduce sound-triggered mobile manipulation, where agents must actively perceive and interact with sound-emitting objects without explicit action instructions. To support these tasks, we develop Habitat-Echo, a data platform that integrates acoustic rendering with physical interaction. We further propose a baseline comprising a high-level task planner and low-level policy models to complete these tasks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed baseline empowers agents to actively detect and respond to auditory events, eliminating the need for case-by-case instructions. Notably, in the challenging dual-source scenario, the agent successfully isolates the primary source from overlapping acoustic interference to execute the first interaction, and subsequently proceeds to manipulate the secondary object, verifying the robustness of the baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u58f0\u97f3\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u8ba9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u58f0\u97f3\u6e90\u5e76\u6267\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6587\u672c\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1Habitat-Echo\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u53f0\uff08\u96c6\u6210\u58f0\u5b66\u6e32\u67d3\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u9ad8\u5c42\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u4f4e\u5c42\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u8ba9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e3b\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u542c\u89c9\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9010\u6848\u4f8b\u6307\u4ee4\uff1b\u5728\u53cc\u58f0\u6e90\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u9694\u79bb\u4e3b\u58f0\u6e90\u5e76\u64cd\u4f5c\u6b21\u8981\u5bf9\u8c61", "conclusion": "\u58f0\u97f3\u89e6\u53d1\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff0cHabitat-Echo\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301"}}

Supervised enhancement methods assume access to clean targets or known degradations; conditions rarely met in practice. We present a blind, self-supervised enhancement framework that jointly deconvolves and denoises B-mode images using a Swin Convolutional U-Net trained with a \\emph{physics-guided} degradation model. From each training frame, we extract rotated/cropped patches and synthesize inputs by (i) convolving with a Gaussian PSF surrogate and (ii) injecting noise via either spatial additive Gaussian noise or complex Fourier-domain perturbations that emulate phase/magnitude distortions. For US scans, clean-like targets are obtained via non-local low-rank (NLLR) denoising, removing the need for ground truth; for natural images, the originals serve as targets. Trained and validated on UDIAT~B, JNU-IFM, and XPIE Set-P, and evaluated additionally on a 700-image PSFHS test set, the method achieves the highest PSNR/SSIM across Gaussian and speckle noise levels, with margins that widen under stronger corruption. Relative to MSANN, Restormer, and DnCNN, it typically preserves an extra $\\sim$1--4\\,dB PSNR and 0.05--0.15 SSIM in heavy Gaussian noise, and $\\sim$2--5\\,dB PSNR and 0.05--0.20 SSIM under severe speckle.

Existing MLLM unlearning methods largely adopt approaches developed for LLMs. They treat all answer tokens uniformly, disregarding their varying importance in the unlearning process. Moreover, these methods focus exclusively on the language modality, disregarding visual cues that indicate key tokens in answers. In this paper, after formulating the problem of unlearning in multimodal question answering for MLLMs, we propose Visual-Guided Key-Token Regularization (ViKeR). We leverage irrelevant visual inputs to predict ideal post-unlearning token-level distributions and use these distributions to regularize the unlearning process, thereby prioritizing key tokens. Further, we define key tokens in unlearning via information entropy and discuss ViKeR's effectiveness through token-level gradient reweighting, which amplifies updates on key tokens.

Depth-guided reprojection further improves robustness to latency and allows users to balance fidelity with refresh rate.\n  We compare our method against direct path tracing and Gaussian Splatting.

We study a heterogeneous multi-step binary communication game where agents differ in modality and lack perceptual grounding. Despite perceptual misalignment, multimodal systems converge to class-consistent messages grounded in perceptual input. Unimodal systems communicate more efficiently, using fewer bits and achieving lower classification entropy, while multimodal agents require greater information exchange and exhibit higher uncertainty. Bit perturbation experiments provide strong evidence that meaning is encoded in a distributional rather than compositional manner, as each bit's contribution depends on its surrounding pattern. Finally, interoperability analyses show that systems trained in different perceptual worlds fail to directly communicate, but limited fine-tuning enables successful cross-system communication. This work positions emergent communication as a framework for studying how agents adapt and transfer representations across heterogeneous modalities, opening new directions for both theory and experimentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f02\u6784\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6b65\u4e8c\u5143\u901a\u4fe1\u6e38\u620f\u53d1\u5c55\u51fa\u7c7b\u522b\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\u7f16\u7801\u662f\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7684\u800c\u975e\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u7684\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6d8c\u73b0\u901a\u4fe1\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u540c\u8d28\u6a21\u6001\u6216\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5982\u4f55\u53d1\u5c55\u5171\u4eab\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f02\u6784\u591a\u6b65\u4e8c\u5143\u901a\u4fe1\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u7279\u6270\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u901a\u4fe1\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u5206\u6790\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u4e16\u754c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u95f4\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ecd\u80fd\u6536\u655b\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e00\u81f4\u6d88\u606f\u3002\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u4fe1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u6bd4\u7279\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u71b5\u66f4\u4f4e\uff09\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u6362\u4e14\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002\u6bd4\u7279\u6270\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u610f\u4e49\u4ee5\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u800c\u975e\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u4e16\u754c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u9650\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6d8c\u73b0\u901a\u4fe1\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5982\u4f55\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u8de8\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u9012\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u3002"}}

While generative AI offers a promising avenue for surrogate modeling, standard video generation architectures lack the specific control and data compatibility required for physical simulations. This paper introduces a geometry aware world model architecture, derived from a video generation architecture (LongVideoGAN), designed to learn transient physics. We introduce two key architecture elements: (1) a twofold conditioning mechanism incorporating global physical parameters and local geometric masks, and (2) an architectural adaptation to support arbitrary channel dimensions, moving beyond standard RGB constraints. We evaluate this approach on a 2D transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problem involving convective heat transfer from buoyancy-driven flow coupled to a heat flow in a solid structure. We demonstrate that the conditioned model successfully reproduces complex temporal dynamics and spatial correlations of the training data.

However, most existing approaches assume a single universal winning ticket shared across all inputs, ignoring the inherent heterogeneity of real-world data. In this work, we propose Routing the Lottery (RTL), an adaptive pruning framework that discovers multiple specialized subnetworks, called adaptive tickets, each tailored to a class, semantic cluster, or environmental condition. Across diverse datasets and tasks, RTL consistently outperforms single- and multi-model baselines in balanced accuracy and recall, while using up to 10 times fewer parameters than independent models and exhibiting semantically aligned. Furthermore, we identify subnetwork collapse, a performance drop under aggressive pruning, and introduce a subnetwork similarity score that enables label-free diagnosis of oversparsification.

Among these tasks, video dubbing could greatly benefit from such priors, yet most existing solutions still rely on complex, task-specific pipelines that struggle in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a single-model approach that adapts a foundational audio-video diffusion model for video-to-video dubbing via a lightweight LoRA. The LoRA enables the model to condition on an input audio-video while jointly generating translated audio and synchronized facial motion. To train this LoRA, we leverage the generative model itself to synthesize paired multilingual videos of the same speaker. Specifically, we generate multilingual videos with language switches within a single clip, and then inpaint the face and audio in each half to match the language of the other half. By leveraging the rich generative prior of the audio-visual model, our approach preserves speaker identity and lip synchronization while remaining robust to complex motion and real-world dynamics. We demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality dubbed videos with improved visual fidelity, lip synchronization, and robustness compared to existing dubbing pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u914d\u97f3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LoRA\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u7ffb\u8bd1\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u4f5c", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u914d\u97f3\u65b9\u6848\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LoRA\u9002\u914d\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u751f\u6210\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u914d\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u5207\u6362\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u6280\u672f\u521b\u5efa\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u914d\u97f3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u914d\u97f3\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u5507\u90e8\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4fdd\u7559\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u5507\u90e8\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u89c6\u9891\u914d\u97f3\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6848"}}

We present DynamicVLA, a framework for dynamic object manipulation that integrates temporal reasoning and closed-loop adaptation through three key designs: 1) a compact 0.4B VLA using a convolutional vision encoder for spatially efficient, structurally faithful encoding, enabling fast multimodal inference; 2) Continuous Inference, enabling overlapping reasoning and execution for lower latency and timely adaptation to object motion; and 3) Latent-aware Action Streaming, which bridges the perception-execution gap by enforcing temporally aligned action execution. To fill the missing foundation of dynamic manipulation data, we introduce the Dynamic Object Manipulation (DOM) benchmark, built from scratch with an auto data collection pipeline that efficiently gathers 200K synthetic episodes across 2.8K scenes and 206 objects, and enables fast collection of 2K real-world episodes without teleoperation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate remarkable improvements in response speed, perception, and generalization, positioning DynamicVLA as a unified framework for general dynamic object manipulation across embodiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "DynamicVLA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684VLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7d27\u51d1\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e09\u5927\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684DOM\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9759\u6001\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u8fd9\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "1) \u7d27\u51d1\u76840.4B VLA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5377\u79ef\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u7f16\u7801\uff1b2) \u8fde\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6267\u884c\u91cd\u53e0\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff1b3) \u6f5c\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u6765\u5f25\u5408\u611f\u77e5-\u6267\u884c\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86DOM\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f7fDynamicVLA\u6210\u4e3a\u8de8\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u901a\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "DynamicVLA\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u95ed\u73af\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}
